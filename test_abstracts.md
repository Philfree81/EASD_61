**Background and aims:**
In SOUL, oral semaglutide 14 mg once a day (QD), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), reduced major adverse cardiovascular (CV) event (MACE) risk by 14%. GLP-1 RAs are routinely prescribed to reduce ­HbA and BMI in type 2 diabe- tes (T2D). Whether the CV benefits of oral semaglutide are influenced by baseline ­HbA or BMI is not fully known.

**Materials and methods:**
SOUL’s primary outcome was time to first MACE, assessed for this post hoc analysis by baseline ­HbA , BMI and body weight using Cox regression.

**Results:**
People with T2D (n=9650; ­HbA 6.5–10%) and known ath- erosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) were randomized to oral semaglutide or placebo and followed for a mean of 47.5 months. We found significant differences in MACE out- comes associated with oral semaglutide use by baseline ­HbA , with greater effects apparent with ­HbA >8.0% (Fig.). When the data were further analysed across four ­HbA strata, the MACE benefit from oral semaglutide appeared to apply to those with ­HbA >7%. The effects of oral semaglutide on MACE were the same in those with BMI above / below 30 kg/m , as well as across all four BMI strata, and above / below the mean body weight (87.9 kg) (Fig.).

**Conclusion:**
In SOUL, the CV benefits of oral semaglutide appeared more pronounced with higher ­HbA levels at baseline but were con- sistent across various BMI categories. These data may help inform the individualised use of oral semaglutide in people with T2D and ASCVD and/or CKD.

**Background and aims:**
People with early-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) have faster beta-cell deterioration and more aggressive disease progres- sion than their late-onset counterparts. However, no tailored treatment guidelines exist for this group. We hypothesized that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) treatment would be more effec- tive in reducing CVD risk in early-onset T2D than in late-onset T2D, due to the higher prevalence of obesity in the former.

**Materials and methods:**
We emulated a two-arm randomized clinical trial using Swedish nationwide registers from 2010 to 2021, in indi- viduals with T2D, treated with metformin. We compared the risk of CVD between those who initiated GLP-1 RAs and those who started insulin, separately in early-onset (diagnosed at age <40) and late-onset (age ≥40) T2D. To account for differences between treatment groups at treatment initiation, we applied inverse probability weighting, adjusting for socioeconomic status, age, diabetes duration, BMI, HbA1c, history of CVD, liver and renal diseases, use of other glucose-lowering drugs, use of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and other drugs, as well as prior hospitalizations and outpatient visits. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to estimate the risk ratio (RR) and risk difference for CVD in GLP-1 RA versus insulin users.

**Results:**
We analysed 3768 GLP-1 RA users (151 CVD events) and 4504 insulin users (402 CVD events) in early-onset T2D, and 27,557 GLP-1 RA users and 56,301 insulin users in late-onset T2D. The RR (95% CI) of CVD for GLP-1 RA versus insulin was 0.81 (0.63, 1.00) in early-onset T2D and 0.73 (0.69, 0.76) in late-onset T2D. The beneficial effect GLP-1 RA in early-onset T2D was primarily seen within the first 4 years after initiation; RRs were 0.57 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.85), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.96), and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.06) after 1, 4, and 10 years of treatment initiation, respectively (Figure 1). In early-onset T2D, GLP-1 RA users experienced 12 fewer CVD events per 1000 individuals com- pared to insulin users during the ­4 year after treatment initiation.

**Conclusion:**
GLP-1 RA is superior to insulin in reducing CVD risk in early-onset T2D with background metformin use during the first 4 years following treatment initiation. In addition, GLP-1 RA treatment appears to be similarly effective in early-onset T2D as in late-onset T2D.

**Background and aims:**
The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index is asso- ciated with insulin resistance. We evaluated if higher baseline TyG indices are associated with increased CV risk and if icosapent ethyl modifies CVD event rates.

**Materials and methods:**
The multicenter, double blind, clinical trial REDUCE-IT enrolled statin-treated patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, controlled LDL-C, and either diabetes with risk factors or CVD. This post hoc analysis included patients randomized to icosapent ethyl (2g twice/day) or placebo and stratified patients by baseline TyG index tertiles. Primary endpoint (composite of cardio- vascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina) and key secondary endpoint rates (composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) were determined by baseline TyG index tertile with Cox proportional hazard models.

**Results:**
Among 8179 patients in REDUCE-IT, 8172 (99.9%) had baseline TyG index data. Median TyG index was 9.10 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.26), 9.50 (IQR: 0.18), and 9.98 (IQR: 0.37) in the lower, middle, and upper tertiles, respectively. Placebo group patients in higher TyG index tertiles had higher primary endpoint rates (Figure). Overall, icosapent ethyl reduced the primary endpoint rate consistently vs placebo across lower (16.5% vs 19.8%, HR: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.68, 0.97]), middle (16.6% vs 22.4%, HR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.59, 0.83]), and upper (18.6% vs 24.0%, HR: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.87]) TyG index tertiles (Pint=0.49). Similar reductions with icosapent ethyl vs pla- cebo occurred in the secondary prevention subgroup (N=5779): lower (18.3% vs 21.5%, HR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.68, 1.01]), middle (18.2% vs 26.2%, HR: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.79]), and upper (21.5% vs 28.9%, HR: 0.71 [95% CI: 0.59, 0.85]) TyG index tertiles (Pint=0.24). At 1 year, the overall cohort had consistent primary endpoint benefit irrespective of TyG index reduction (regression slope for HR per unit TyG index decrease [RS]: -1.15 [95% CI: -3.27, 0.98], P=0.25), and the secondary prevention subgroup had increasing treatment benefit with greater TyG index reduction (RS: -2.63 [95% CI: -4.99, -0.26], P=0.03).

**Conclusion:**
Among patients with elevated triglycerides who have dia- betes with risk factors or CVD, higher baseline TyG indices indicated increasing CV risk. Icosapent ethyl reduced CVD rates irrespective of baseline TyG index.

**Background and aims:**
Among anti-diabetic treatments, the impact of insulin on cardiorenal outcomes in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unclear, while the proposed cardiovascular (CV) benefits of metformin are not well established. Additionally, although canagliflozin is known to lower cardiorenal risk, its specific effects in insulin-treated patients are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of background insulin and metformin monotherapy on major CV and renal outcomes in individuals with T2D and high CV risk, and to assess whether canagliflozin can offset the cardio-renal risk associated with different anti-diabetic therapies.

**Materials and methods:**
We merged data from the CANVAS and CREDENCE trials, totaling 14,530 participants aged 30-90 years, randomized to placebo or canagliflozin (100-300 mg) treatment and followed up for a median of 2.6 years. Among them, 2,766 (19%) were on insulin monotherapy and 2,127 (14.6%) on metformin mono- therapy. Outcomes included a composite of hospitalization for heart failure (hHF) and CV death (cvDeath), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), all-cause death (acDeath), non-fatal myocardial infarc- tion (nfMI), and a composite of renal outcomes. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess risk, with extensive adjustments for confounders.

**Results:**
Patients on insulin monotherapy were older, with longer diabetes duration and poorer glycaemic control. In univariate analy- sis, insulin was associated with an increased risk of hHF/cvDeath (HR=1.80 [95% CI:1.57-2.05]), MACE (HR=1.61 [95% CI:1.43- 1.81]), acDeath (HR=1.66 [95% CI:1.45-1.90]), nfMI (HR=1.42 [95% CI:1.16-1.73]) and renal outcomes (HR=1.85 [95% CI:1.56- 2.20]). After adjusting for confounders, insulin remained a risk factor only for hHF/cvDeath (HR=1.18 [95% CI:1.02-1.36]) and MACE (HR=1.22 [95% CI:1.02-1.45]). In contrast, metformin monotherapy was associated with a reduction in risk of hHF/cvDeath (HR=0.73 [95% CI:0.60-0.89]) MACE (HR=0.77 [95% CI:0.66-0.90]), acDeath (HR=0.78 [95% CI:0.64-0.94]) and renal outcomes (HR=0.71 [95% CI:0.55-0.91]), which disappeared after adjustment for all outcomes. At multivariable analysis, the treatment with canagliflozin signifi- cantly reduced the increased risk for hHF/cvDeath and MACE found in patients treated with insulin monotherapy.

**Conclusion:**
In T2D patients with high CV risk, insulin monother- apy—but not metformin monotherapy—is associated with a higher risk of HF and CV events, independently of key clinical and bio- chemical characteristics, suggesting a direct effect rather than merely reflecting the clinical phenotype. Canagliflozin treatment effectively mitigates the elevated HF and CV risk linked to insulin therapy.

**Background and aims:**
Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control and body composition in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk in the general population. We aim to examine if self-reported physical activity can serve as a prognostic marker of CVD and mortality risk in individuals recently diagnosed with T2D and no previous CVD.

**Materials and methods:**
This prospective cohort study utilized data from the Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Dia- betes (DD2) cohort, including participants from 2010-2023 diag- nosed with T2D within the previous two years. Physical activity was self-reported by 11,355 participants using the Saltin-Grimby Physical Activity Level Scale and categorized into sedentary, light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Primary out- comes were all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, heart failure and CVD death. A parametric sur- vival model with exponential/Gombertz distribution and iterative confounder adjustment was used to estimate HRs with 95% CI. Par- ticipants were followed until first occurrence of either MACE, death, emigration or study end (May 3, 2024). We excluded participants with previous CVD (n=1671).

**Results:**
According to physical activity, 18% reported being sedentary while 62.5% and 19.5% engaged in light physical activity and MVPA. During a median follow-up time of 8.4 years, 1149 CVD events and 1048 deaths occurred. Higher physical activity levels were inversely associated with both MACE and all-cause mortality. After adjustment for age, sex, year of study enrolment, T2D duration, smoking, alco- hol consumption, and waist circumference, participants who engaged in light and MVPA had a 21% and 29% lower risk of MACE, and a 27% and 35% lower risk of all-cause mortality, respectively, compared to sedentary participants (Figure 1). This association was primarily driven by coronary revascularization, heart failure and CVD death. After adjusting for CVD risk factors (LDL, ­HbA , systolic blood pres- sure, eGFR, urine albumin-creatinine ratio) that could potentially medi- ate the associations, the HRs for MVPA remained significant for both MACE (HR: 0.68, 95% CI, 0.51-0.92) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.67, 95% CI, 0.47-0.96), whereas the associations for light physical activity were attenuated, with no longer any observable difference in risk compared to sedentary participants.

**Conclusion:**
Self-reported physical activity was an independent predictor of MACE and all-cause mortality in individuals recently diagnosed with T2D and no previous CVD. For MVPA these associa- tions persisted even after adjustment for classical CVD risk factors.

3. ern California, Pleasanton, CA, USA, University of California, Los

**Background and aims:**
Previous research indicates that a diabetes diagnosis within a family may improve health behaviors at the house- hold level, since one person having diabetes may increase awareness of diabetes risk factors in the household. However, most of this research focuses on spouses/partners and does not include other household members such as adolescent children. To assess household diabetes risk to support family-based diabetes prevention, we leveraged elec- tronic health record (EHR) and administrative data to identify house- hold members of adult patients with prediabetes who are co-insured and reside in the same household and evaluate diabetes risk factors among household members.

**Materials and methods:**
We identified an index cohort of adults with prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 100-125 mg/dL or glycated hemoglobin 5.7-6.4% [39-46 mmol/mol]) and their co-insured house- hold members in 2023. Index cohort and household member character- istics including demographics, enrollment, neighborhood, and utiliza- tion data were pulled for the index cohort within 1-year before index date and 2-years for household members. Age and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for children 2-19 was calculated using the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) 2022 SAS program for CDC Growth Charts. Diabetes risk factors were calculated for those 10 years and older. For adults aged 18 and older, diabetes risk factors were defined as: BMI ≥25 OR a history of gestational diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular disease OR prediabetes based on laboratory values. For children aged 10-17, diabetes risk factors were overweight (age and sex-specific BMI ≥ 85th percentile) or obesity (age and sex-specific BMI ≥ 95th percentile). We also assessed diabetes status for household members 10-years and older using the health system’s diabetes registry. Descriptive statistics were output for both the index cohort and the household members.

**Results:**
Among 356,626 index adults with prediabetes, mean age was 50.5 years, and 51.7% identified as female. The index cohort included 30.1% Non-Hispanic White, 27.9% Asian, 26.6% Hispanic, 9.1% Black, 1.1% Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 5.3% multiracial patients. Obe- sity was present in 58.5% of the index cohort. Household composition varied, with 48.1% identified as one-person households and 51.8% liv- ing in multi-resident households. Over 75% of multi-resident house- holds had at least one household member with additional diabetes risk factors. We identified 364,563 co-residing household members. The mean age of adult household members was 41.5 years and 10.2 years for child household members. Diabetes risk factors were identified in 64.6% of adults and 35.0% of children with overweight/obesity being the most identified risk factor present in 54.9% of adult and 34.1% of child household members. Dysglycemia was present in 32.3% of adult household members, with 20.3% showing prediabetes lab results and 12% having evidence of diabetes.

**Conclusion:**
To our knowledge, this novel study is the first to describe the use of EHR-based measures to assess household diabetes risk. Our study highlights that diabetes risk is clustered within households, how- ever, very few studies and health system prevention programs enroll households/families reflecting a missed opportunity for population- level diabetes prevention.

**Background and aims:**
Loss of proteostasis is regarded as a primary hallmark of aging. Blood proteomic profiling, thus offers a novel avenue for dissecting biological aging processes. Existing proteomic aging measures derived from the overall population have difficulties in capturing heterogeneous aging rates and risk of age-related outcomes among individuals with different glycemic status. Here, we quantified glycemic status-specific protein signatures of aging using a proteomic platform from a large prospective cohort study and correspondingly developed proteomic aging scores (ProAS) for health risk prediction.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 2,923 plasma proteins were meas- ured using Olink Explore 3072 in 46,047 UK Biobank participants, including 37,353 with normoglycemia, 5,977 with prediabetes, and 2,717 with diabetes). A data-driven proteomics strategy was used to identify protein aging biomarkers associated with all-cause mortality and further developed ProAS using light gradient boosting machine algorithm.

**Results:**
Of the 2,923 plasma proteins tested, 11, 23, and 21 representa- tive protein aging biomarkers associated with all-cause mortality were identified among individuals with normoglycemia, prediabetes, and diabetes, respectively. The ProAS integrating specific proteins showed significant associations with mortality and diverse incident diseases. Adding the ProAS in the models improved the predictive accuracy of mortality and incident diseases beyond conventional risk factors, but the predictive performance progressively diminished as glycemic status deteriorated. A total of 70, 50, and 36 out of 102 modifiable factors across seven categories were detected for proteomic aging in normoglycemia, prediabetes, and diabetes, with the strength of these associations declining across the three groups. The genetic analyses revealed 439 significant SNPs associated with ProAS in individuals with normoglycemia, while none was identified in those with predia- betes and diabetes.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrated the heterogeneity of proteomic aging processes and proteomic-based risk prediction of health out- comes across the glycemic spectrum that may render critical clues toward individualized prevention and intervention strategies, even though external validations in independent cohorts are further needed.

2. Munich, Tübingen, Germany, German Center for Diabetes Research,

**Background and aims:**
Osteoporosis has become a major global health challenge and is characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and progressive deterioration of the bone microarchitecture. Increased bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is associated with lower BMD. Chemical shift-encoded magnetic resonance imaging (CSE-MRI) has emerged as a noninvasive, radiation-free method for the quantitative assessment of nonmineralized bone providing the possibility to extract the bone marrow fat fraction (BMFF) in BMAT. Aim of the study was to characterize differences in BMFF in vertebral bodies of the lumbar and lower thoracic spine in a large sample from the general population and a subgroup with diagnosed osteoporosis with regard to glycemic status and obesity to assess the potential as a predictive biomarker.

**Materials and methods:**
Deep learning-based segmentation of ver- tebral bodies from CSE-MRI of >30,000 participants in the MRI sub- study of the German National Cohort (NAKO) and quantification of BMFF in vertebral bodies of the lumbar and lower thoracic spine (ver- tebral bodies Th12 to Th7). Obesity groups were formed based on BMI (NW: 18.5-24.9 kg/m², OW: 25-29.9 kg/m², OB: >30 kg/m²), glycemic status was assessed based on HbA1c using ADA guidelines (NGT: <38.9 mmol/mol, PRE: 38.9-46.4 mmol/mol, DIA: >46.4 mmol/mol). Sex-stratified pairwise testing for differences in means was performed using t-tests with Bonferroni correction.

**Results:**
From 30,920 participants in the NAKO MRI sub-study, data from 28,674 individuals (12,545 women [43.8 %]) was included. Age of participants was 48.3 +/- 12.2 [19-74] years; BMI was 26.6 +/- 4.6 kg/m² [18.5-53.9]. Mean lumbar BMFF was 42.2 +/- 8 % for men and 39.9 +/- 10.3 % for women. Lower thoracic BMFF was 35.1 +/- 7.9 for men and 33.4 +/- 9.9 for women. Across BMI groups, BMFF increased in women and men between with increasing glycemia. For NW partici- pants, lumbar and lower thoracic BMFF was increased comparted to NGT but did not differ between PRE and DIA, whereas in OW and OB groups, BMFF was higher in DIA compared to PRE. In the subgroup with osteoporosis, men were younger (mean age 56.7 years) compared to women (mean age 59.7 years). Mean BMFF was increased compared to age- and BMI-matched controls (39.6 % vs. 37.1 % for men; 37.5 % vs. 36.6 % for women).

**Conclusion:**
Obesity and impaired glycemia lead to an increase in BMFF along the spine. As examplified by the subgroup with diagnosed osteoporosis, this may contribute to lower bone mineral density and increased risk for osteoporosis. Additionally, BMFF may be used as a predictive biomarker for type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate mRNA post-transcriptionally. Evidence shows that pollution alters the expression profile of miRNAs, poten- tially contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In a previous pilot study performed in our group, we found that miR-25, miR-29, miR93 and miR-144 levels were differentially expressed regarding PM10 exposure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between serum miRNAs differentially expressed in subjects exposed to high vs low levels of PM10 pollut- ants with T2DM development in Spanish adult population.

**Materials and methods:**
997 subjects from the Di@bet.es cohort study (334 men and 664 women) and without T2DM at baseline were stud- ied. T2DM was diagnosed at baseline and after 7.5 years of follow-up. Socio-demographic, anthropometric, clinical data and environmental data were recorded, including PM10 particle matter exposure levels along follow up. The area under the curve for PM10 yearly measure- ments was calculated and categorized based on ­25 percentile (low vs high). Baseline serum miRNAs levels of miR-25, miR-29, miR93 and miR-144 were measured by real-time qPCR, using sp6 as normalizer and categorized based on the 75th percentile. Association analyses were performed using logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders.

**Results:**
In this study population, we validated our previous results regarding the differential expression of the miRNAs: miR-25, miR- 29, miR93 and miR-144 between high and low exposure of PM10. Specifically, all these miRNA levels were significantly lower in subjects with high PM10 exposure (p value < 0.001 for miR-25, miR-29, miR-93 and p value < 0.05 for miR-144). In the overall population, results from adjusted multivariable models showed that the high levels of these miRNAs were, in all cases, a significant independent risk factor for the development of T2DM. Sex-based stratification analysis showed a risk effect of high levels of miR-25, miR-29, miR-93 in both sexes, although the significant association was only retained in women for all the miRNAs studied (Table 1). In any of our models, PM10 categories were associated with T2DM development. The use of PM10 as a continuous variable instead of dichotomic did not modify these associations

**Conclusion:**
High levels of miR-25, miR-29, miR93 and miR-144 might be considered as early risk factors for the development of T2DM in the Spanish population, with this effect being more evident in women.

**Background and aims:**
Emerging evidence suggests that the major type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk factor domains—genetics, adverse intrau- terine environment, and postnatal lifestyle—are distinct and additive. We investigated whether individuals who likely developed T2D pre- dominantly through genetic, prenatal, or inferred postnatal lifestyle exhibit differential clinical presentations and disease courses up to 10 years after diagnosis.

**Materials and methods:**
In 7,867 individuals with newly diagnosed T2D, those in the highest 25% of a T2D genetic risk score (GRS) with birthweight ≥3000 g (the lowest 25% threshold) were classified as Genetic T2D. Those in the lower 75% of GRS with birthweight <3000 g were classified as Prenatal T2D. The remaining individuals were divided into a group with a presumed predominant postnatal Lifestyle aetiology (in the lower 75% GRS, birthweight ≥3000 g) and a residual group not otherwise classified. Linear regression was used for baseline characteristics. In subsequent follow-up analyses, 10-year standardised risks of complications were estimated via the Aalen-Johansen estimator with g-formula. Models were controlled for sex, calendar year at birth, age, and diabetes duration.

**Results:**
18% were allocated to Genetic (n=1,435), 15% to Prena- tal (n=1,195), 56% to Lifestyle (n=4,380), and 11% to Residual (n=857). Compared with the Genetic group, the Prenatal group had a 1.2-year (95% CI 0.4, 2.1) younger age at T2D diagnosis, 6.6% (95% CI 1.7, 11.8) higher triglycerides, 8.9% (95% CI 4.9, 13.0) higher HOMA2-β, 6.9% (95% CI 3.0, 10.7) lower HOMA2 insu- lin sensitivity, and 14.9% (95% CI 4.9, 25.8) higher hsCRP. The Lifestyle group had a 2.3-year (95% CI 1.7, 3.0) older age at T2D diagnosis, a 1.9 kg/m (95% CI 1.5, 2.3) higher BMI, 5.3% (95% CI 1.4, 9.3) higher triglycerides, 9.7% (95% CI 6.5, 13.0) higher HOMA2-β, 6.9% (95% CI 3.8, 9.9) lower HOMA2 insulin sensitiv- ity, and a 24.1% (95% CI 15.7, 33.2) higher hsCRP. In follow-up analyses, the 10-year standardised risk of a 3-point Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) was 14.8% for Prenatal and 13.2% for Lifestyle, compared with 11.5% in the Genetic group, yielding excess risk differences (RD) of +3.3% (95% CI 0.6, 6.0) and +1.7% (95% CI -0.3, 3.6), respectively. The 10-year standardised risk of microvascular complications was 25.9% for Prenatal and 25.4% for Lifestyle, compared with 21.8% in the Genetic group, yielding excess RDs of 4.1% (95% CI 0.7, 7.5) and 3.5% (95% CI 1.0, 6.1), respec- tively. All-cause mortality risk was 16.4% in the Prenatal and 15.7% in the Lifestyle group, compared with 14.3% in the Genetic group, yielding slightly higher RDs of 2.0% (95% CI -0.5, 4.6) and 1.3% (95% CI -0.6, 3.2), respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Individuals who likely developed T2D based on predomi- nant Prenatal or Lifestyle aetiologies exhibit a more severe clinical presentation and increased risk of macro- and microvascular compli- cations compared with those predominantly genetically predisposed. Subdividing T2D by GRS, birthweight, and inferred postnatal lifestyle may refine risk assessment and therapeutic strategies.

**Ethnic-specific associations of predefined dietary patterns with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 826 000 adults with 71 000 incident cases from 29 cohorts in 15 countries**

J.Y. Lee

**Background and aims:**
Diet is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D), and specific dietary patterns have been associated with lower T2D incidence. Both dietary patterns and T2D risk vary by ethnicity, but whether the association of dietary patterns with T2D incidence would be heterogeneous by ethnicity has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the overall and ethnic-specific associations of predefined dietary pattern indices with T2D incidence and to assess the heterogeneity of these associa- tions across ethnic groups.

**Materials and methods:**
A systematic literature search was con- ducted using EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCOhost Global Health databases up to 19 July 2024. Pro- spective studies investigating the association of the three most widely studied healthy dietary pattern indices with T2D incidence in adults were included in the current analyses (Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)). Whenever available, results from sub- group analyses by ethnicity were extracted. For each index, random- effects meta-analysis with generalised least-squares trend estimation was performed to estimate the linear association in all cohorts and predefined ethnic groups. All estimates were harmonised to represent the association of the ­90 compared to the ­10 percentile of adherence to the index in the respective studies. Heterogeneity between ethnic groups was assessed using meta-regression. Egger’s test was performed to test for the presence of small-study effects.

**Results:**
A total of 33 publications from 29 cohorts reporting 107 eth- nic-specific associations of the MedDiet, AHEI, and DASH indices with T2D incidence were included. One-third to half of the estimates were from cohorts or their subgroups of European ethnicity (Table 1). The overall pooled relative risks (95% CI) for the ­90 compared to the ­10 percentile of adherence to the index were 0.83 (0.79-0.87) for MedDiet, 0.79 (0.73-0.85) for AHEI, and 0.77 (0.73-0.82) for DASH, with substantial heterogeneity between studies ­(I = 62% to 71%). While the number of studies for most of the ethnic groups was small (< 10), there was neither significant evidence of heterogeneity in the associations across ethnic groups (p > 0.05 for each index; Table 1) nor of small-study bias (p > 0.05 for each index).

**Conclusion:**
In line with previous evidence, MedDiet, AHEI, and DASH dietary patterns were associated with lower T2D incidence. Our findings of no significant heterogeneity across ethnic groups sug- gest that major ethnic groups benefit equally from higher adherence to these dietary patterns. Further analyses are needed to better understand potential sources of heterogeneity and biases to strengthen the robust- ness of the findings.

**Background and aims:**
Current diabetes classification relies primarily on etiology and treatment modalities rather than on individual glycemic behavior. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology offers an opportunity to refine classification based on glucose variability pat- terns, enabling more personalized management approaches. We aimed to develop a novel diabetes classification system based on glucose vari- ability patterns derived from CGM data and evaluate its potential for personalized treatment strategies.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed CGM data from 527 patients with various types of diabetes over a 14-day period. Glucose vari- ability metrics, including coefficient of variation, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions, and time in range, were calculated. Unsupervised machine learning techniques, including k-means clustering and hierar- chical clustering, were applied to identify distinct glucose variability signatures. Differential treatment responses were evaluated for each identified subgroup.

**Results:**
Five novel subgroups were identified, each characterized by specific variability patterns: "stable hyperglycemia" (31% of patients), "brittle hypoglycemia-prone" (18%), "postprandial spike" (22%), "dawn phenomenon dominant" (16%), and "erratic fluctuator" (13%). Each subgroup showed differential responses to various treat- ment strategies (p<0.001). The "postprandial spike" group showed a 32% greater reduction in glucose excursions with GLP-1 recep- tor agonists compared to other groups (95% CI: 25-39%, p<0.001). The "dawn phenomenon" group demonstrated superior response to SGLT-2 inhibitors with a 28% greater reduction in morning hyper- glycemia (95% CI: 21-35%, p<0.001). The "brittle hypoglycemia- prone" group showed significantly better outcomes with hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery systems (reduction in hypoglycemic events: 76% vs. 24%, p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
This novel classification system based on glucose varia- bility patterns provides a more nuanced understanding of diabetes phe- notypes beyond traditional taxonomies. It offers the potential for more targeted interventions and improved glycemic outcomes by tailoring treatment regimens to specific glucose variability profiles. Implemen- tation of this classification approach could transform diabetes care by enabling truly personalized therapeutic strategies based on individual glycemic behavior rather than broad diagnostic categories.

**Background and aims:**
The efficacy of diabetes therapies varies con- siderably between individuals, yet the underlying determinants remain poorly understood. We investigated whether specific patterns of glyce- mic variability could predict differential treatment responses and clini- cal outcomes, potentially informing personalized therapeutic strategies.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from 527 patients with diabetes across multiple centers. Each patient underwent 14-day monitoring under standardized condi- tions. Advanced time-series analytics and pattern recognition algo- rithms were applied to identify recurring glycemic signatures. Sub- sequent correlation with medication efficacy, hypoglycemic events, and complication rates was performed through a structured clinical follow-up protocol over 6 months.

**Results:**
Pattern recognition algorithms identified five distinct gly- cemic signatures: sustained hyperglycemia with minimal oscillations (31%), high-frequency hypoglycemic excursions (18%), pronounced postprandial glucose spikes (22%), early morning glucose elevations (16%), and chaotic fluctuation patterns (13%). Therapeutic responses showed remarkable signature-specific patterns. Patients with post- prandial spike signatures showed superior response to incretin-based therapies (glycemic variability reduction: 32% vs. 9% in other pat- terns, p<0.001). Early morning elevation patterns predicted excellent response to sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (morning glucose reduction: 63mg/dL vs. 18mg/dL, p<0.001). High-frequency hypogly- cemia patterns predicted superior outcomes with continuous insulin infusion systems versus multiple daily injections (hypoglycemia reduc- tion: 76% vs. 34%, p<0.001). Most significantly, glycemic signatures predicted future hospitalization for acute metabolic complications with greater accuracy than HbA1c, disease duration, or known risk factors (area under ROC curve: 0.83 vs. 0.67, p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Specific glycemic signatures derived from CGM data predict medication efficacy and complication risk with substantially greater accuracy than traditional clinical parameters. Implementation of signature-based therapeutic selection could significantly improve treatment outcomes while reducing adverse events in diabetes care. These findings support incorporating glycemic pattern analysis into routine clinical decision-making to advance personalized diabetes management.

**Background and aims:**
GDM is one of the most common, contentious, costly, and challenging metabolic disorders during pregnancy and is increasing in prevalence. It is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. There are differences of opinion regarding the type and timing of tests used to diagnose GDM. Screening in early preg- nancy may be associated with an early opportunity for intervention and reduced adverse outcomes. Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes may have glucose homeostasis irregularities that commence before or during early pregnancy. There is limited data on CGM’s value in diagnosing or predicting GDM. Our study aimed to assess whether continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in early pregnancy predicts gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

**Materials and methods:**
A prospective observational study was con- ducted at a large university maternity hospital. Non-diabetic pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy and at least one risk factor for GDM development were recruited following their first booking ultrasound. CGM sensors (FreeStyle Libre Pro) were worn for 14 days during early pregnancy (<20 weeks). All participants underwent a 75g OGTT at 26-28 weeks gestation, and GDM was diagnosed using WHO 2013 criteria. Sensors recorded glucose levels every 15 minutes. Partici- pants were blinded to the data. CGM metrics were analysed, including mean glucose, glycaemic variability (standard deviation, coefficient of variation, Mean Amplitude of Glycaemic Excursions), time in range (3.5-7.8 mmol/L), and time above/below range. Data analysis employed descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis.

**Results:**
A total of 222 women participated in the study, of whom 208 (93.7%) had results available for both CGM and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Of the study population, 57 (27.4%) were diagnosed with GDM. Women with GDM demonstrated significantly higher CGM met- rics, including mean glucose (p<0.001), nocturnal glucose (p<0.001), glycaemic variability (p<0.001), and HbA1c (p<0.001), in comparison to those without GDM. Key predictors, such as mean glucose (AUC 0.745) and nocturnal glucose (AUC 0.763), exhibited strong predictive capability. Integrating CGM metrics with clinical risk factors enhanced the accuracy of GDM prediction (AUC 0.859).

**Conclusion:**
CGM can identify women at risk of GDM earlier in pregnancy than standard screening. This research establishes a foun- dation for integrating CGM technology into clinical practice for GDM prediction.

7. sist.Ai, Bangalore, India, Amar Hospital, Patiala, India.

**Background and aims:**
Recent evidence suggests that specific pat- terns of glycemic variability may precede diabetes complications by several years, yet these warning signals remain undetected by conven- tional monitoring. We developed and validated a novel CGM analy- sis framework to identify unique "glycemic variability fingerprints" (GVFs) that predict future complications and treatment failure with remarkable accuracy.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed 12,048 hours of CGM data from 134 patients with diabetes, matched against 5-year retrospective clinical histories. Using an advanced multi-dimensional time-series analysis algorithm, we extracted specific variability signatures and cor- related them with documented complications. The algorithm’s predic- tive accuracy was validated in a prospective 18-month follow-up phase. Participants were stratified into intervention and observation groups based on GVF findings

**Results:**
Six distinct GVFs were identified, each strongly associated with specific future complications: Pattern A (23.1% of patients) with autonomic neuropathy (hazard ratio 6.3, 95% CI 3.8-8.9, p<0.0001); Pattern B (18.7%) with nephropathy progression (GFR decline >10ml/ min/year, HR 4.2, p<0.001); Pattern C (15.7%) with retinopathy advancement (HR 5.1, p<0.001); Pattern D (16.4%) with recurrent DKA/HHS (HR 7.8, p<0.0001); Pattern E (14.2%) with treatment resistance (HR 3.9, p<0.001); and Pattern F (11.9%) with hypogly- cemia unawareness (HR 8.2, p<0.0001). Remarkably, these patterns preceded clinical manifestations by 11-32 months and were detectable even when HbA1c, time-in-range, and standard CGM metrics appeared optimal. In the intervention group (n=67), GVF-guided therapy modi- fications reduced complication rates by 62% and hospitalization risk by 41% compared to the observation group (p<0.0001).

**Conclusion:**
Glycemic variability fingerprints represent a paradigm shift in diabetes management, enabling identification of complication risk years before clinical manifestation. This breakthrough approach transforms CGM from a monitoring tool into a powerful predictive technology for precision diabetes care. Early intervention based on GVF analysis significantly reduces complication rates and hospitali- zations, promising substantial improvements in patient outcomes and healthcare economics.

2. USA, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.

**Background and aims:**
Hospitals are increasingly using real-time con- tinuous glucose monitoring (rt-CGM). In this observational study, we compared the clinical outcomes of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) whose glucose levels were monitored remotely using rt-CGM to those observed with hourly point-of-care (POC) capillary glucose testing.

**Materials and methods:**
We examined the time needed to resolve DKA, the frequency of point-of-care (POC) glucose testing, occur- rences of hypoglycemic events, and the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays among adults with DKA. This included patients whose glucose levels were monitored using rt-CGM and treated outside the ICU as well as those triaged to the ICU who under- went hourly POC glucose testing, which is our institution’s standard of care (STD). Both groups received intravenous (IV) insulin treatment according to the hospital protocol.

**Results:**
Clinical characteristics, admission blood glucose (BG), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), and bicarbonate are detailed in Table 1. The length of hospital stay was 120 hours for patients in the CGM/DKA group (n=44) and 99.1 hours for those monitored through hourly POC glucose testing in the STD/DKA group (n=119), p=0.2684. Fifty percent of patients triaged to the ICU had DKA resolved in the Emergency Department (ED), and 50% were admit- ted to the ICU; the median ICU stay was 28.5 hours. The median number of POC glucose tests was 5 (IQR 3, 7) in the CGM/DKA group and 12 (IQR 8, 22) in the STD/DKA group (p < 0.0001). The time to resolution of DKA was 12.8 hours in the CGM/DKA group and 12 hours in the STD/DKA group (p = 0.4024). There were no hypoglycemic events in patients monitored via rt-CGM, compared to 3 patients (2.5%) monitored through hourly POC glucose testing.

**Conclusion:**
Remote rt-CGM is safe for hospitalized adults with DKA. It reduces the frequency of POC glucose testing, prevents ICU admissions, and results in comparable hospital lengths of stay, times to resolution, and outcomes for patients with DKA.

5. Austria, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.

**Background and aims:**
Physical activity (PA) can improve glycemic control in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the risk of hypo- glycemia is the biggest barrier to exercise. The aim was to analyze continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) profiles of adolescents with T1D depending on their PA.

**Materials and methods:**
We included individuals with T1D aged 12-21 years documented from July 2023 to December 2024 in the German/Austrian/Swiss/Luxembourgian DPV-registry (Diabetes- Patienten-Verlaufsdokumentation) who had available CGM profiles with at least 10 days of sensor data and information on PA. Indi- viduals were categorized by the amount of weekly PA (low: 0-2h, moderate: 3-4h, high ≥5h). Fractional logit regression was used to investigate time in range (70-180 md/dl, TIR) and time below range (<70 mg/dl, TBR) in association with PA, adjusted for age, sex, diabetes duration, migration status, smoking history and insulin therapy (multiple daily injection (MDI), continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or automated insulin delivery (AID)). Addi- tionally, the models were stratified by insulin therapy. All models were applied for the hourly intervals of CGM profiles including a random effect for repeated measurements and weighting for the number of days with complete sensor profile per individual.

**Results:**
2577 individuals (656 (25%) with MDI, 291 (11%) with CSII and 1630 (63%) with AID) were included. 53% were male with median age (lower and upper quartile) of 15.3 (13.5-16.9) years, dia- betes duration of 6.0 (3.2-9.4) years, 98 (52-219) days with CGM profile, glycated hemoglobin of 7.3 (6.6-8.1) % and sensor glucose of 169 (153-191) mg/dl. Unadjusted median TIR over the whole observa- tion period was higher in those with high PA (64% (53-73)) compared to those with moderate PA (59% (49-70)) or low PA (58% (45-69), p<0.001), but TBR was also higher in the high PA group (2.1% (1.3- 4.0)) compared to the moderate PA group (1.9% (0.9-3.4)) and the low PA group (1.7% (0.9-3.3), p<0.001). Fractional logit regression models revealed higher TIR over the entire day in the high PA group compared to the moderate PA group which in turn had higher TIR than the low PA group. TBR was comparable between the low and moderate PA group, but higher in the high PA group in the afternoon and during the night. Stratification for insulin therapy revealed that those with MDI and high PA had higher TBR during the night than those with lower PA, while these differences were much smaller in the AID group (figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
Higher PA was associated with higher TIR at the cost of slightly higher TBR, but currently used AID-systems seem to be generally effective in mitigating hypoglycemia in physically active adolescents and young adults with T1D.

**Immunomodulation without sustained lymphodepletion: SAB-142, a fully human anti-thymocyte globulin**

S. Stoyanov

**Background and aims:**
Lymphodepleting regimens have been explored in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) but pose significant challenges. Current strategies in T1D represent a paradigm shift, focusing on tar- geted immune modulation to achieve a state of immunotolerance to beta cells. Rabbit Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (rATG) has previously been used to treat T1D patients, but immunogenicity prevents repeat dosing. To overcome this immunogenicity, a fully human anti-thymo- cyte polyclonal antibody (SAB-142) was generated and is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial.

**Materials and methods:**
SAB-142-101 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of SAB-142 in healthy volunteers. SAB-142 was admin- istered intravenously (IV) as an ascending dose trial of up to 0.5 mg/ kg on Day 1 and up to 2 mg/kg on Day 2. To investigate SAB-142 and rATG effector function, a commercial neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding immunoassay was utilized. For measuring antibody depend- ent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activation, Jurkat cells that contain stably expressed FcRs with a luciferase bioreporter downstream of the endogenous signaling pathways were used.

**Results:**
Following a single IV infusion, only a transient lymphopenia following administration of SAB-142 was observed, characterized by abnormal clinically significant (low) lymphocyte levels in all partici- pants who received a total dose of 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 mg/kg. However, by Day 3, only 19% of participants who received 1.5 or 2.5 mg/kg had abnormal lymphocyte levels, and no abnormal values were observed from Day 4 to the end of the study at Day 120. On the contrary, in clini- cal trials with low dose rATG at 2.5 mg/kg, a profound and long-lasting lymphopenia of predominantly CD4+ T cells was observed, lasting beyond 2 years from the dose administration. To gain insight into T cell lymphodepletion, studies characterizing the Fc effector functions of SAB-142 and rATG were performed. For FcRn binding, our results showed that SAB-142 had 5 to 7 times higher binding to the FcRn in comparison to rATG. Additionally, activation of ADCC via Fc binding to the FcγRIIIA was examined. The ­EC of rATG for ADCC activation was 0.3μg/mL compared to ­EC of 3.7μg/mL for SAB-142.

**Conclusion:**
For the SAB-142-101 trial, only transient peripheral lym- phopenia was observed over the initial days of dosing. The emerging safety profile of SAB-142, with lack of sustained lymphopenia, is a major safety advantage of SAB-142. No sustained depletion of major blood cells, coupled with the lack of serum sickness and immunogenic- ity, creates a favorable SAB-142 safety profile for the target patient population across adult, adolescent, and pediatric age groups. The bind- ing differences of SAB-142 and rATG to the FcRn suggest that SAB-142 may have higher levels of endothelial transport and recycling into lymph nodes or other highly perfused tissues. The meas- ured ADCC ­EC levels demonstrate that rATG has 10 times greater ADCC activity compared to SAB-142. This result indicates that a sig- nificantly lower concentration of rATG is required for ADCC pathway activation, which is consistent with clinical lymphodepletion by rATG in T1D clinical studies even at low doses.

3. nity NHS Trust, Birmingham, UK, University of Warwick, Warwick,

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune con- dition characterised by destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Screening for islet-specific autoantibodies (Aab) in healthy chil- dren can detect T1D before symptoms appear, reducing complications like diabetic ketoacidosis. The ELSA study, the UK’s largest paediatric general population screening trial for T1D, aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of screening children aged 3-13 for T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Children across all four UK nations were offered screening for islet-specific Aab through dried blood spot (DBS) samples through a variety of settings. These included schools, primary care physicians, social media, hospitals and community centres. Posi- tive DBS results were followed by venous confirmation tests for spe- cific Aab. Children with multiple positive Aabs underwent metabolic staging (oral glucose tolerance test). Feasibility was evaluated based on recruitment modality, uptake and demographic factors. Acceptability was assessed through qualitative interviews with families following ELSA completion (child screened negative or positive, single autoan- tibody or multiple, stage 1-3 and those who declined screening).

**Results:**
Between November 2022-November 2024, 25,165 children were enrolled. The median age was 8 years (IQR 5-10 years), 52% male, 1.46 children enrolled per family, with 37% of families hav- ing a history of T1D. School, primary care and social media-based recruitment worked well, whereas DBS testing at home and in school settings were most popular. Recruitment varied by screening modal- ity, with higher participation from non-white ethnicities in commu- nity settings. There was under-recruitment in Black and south Asian populations as well as IMD quintiles 1-2. 98.1% of children screened DBS negative, and 1.8% positive. 95% of those with positive results proceeded to venous confirmation and metabolic staging. A total of 56 single antibody and 125 multiple antibody children were identified and appropriate education and support provided. Adverse events were rare. Overall there was high satisfaction and trust with the study process. Importantly, the benefits of screening were acceptable regardless of the screening outcome.

**Conclusion:**
The ELSA study outlies the feasibility and acceptabil- ity of general population screening for T1D in children in the UK. It demonstrated that 1. a model of home or school-based DBS testing followed by confirmatory venous testing at a local site is both feasible and acceptable, 2. school, primary care and social media-based recruit- ment followed by home or school based DBS testing worked well in a research setting, 3. whilst a diverse study population can be recruited, under-representation of certain ethnic groups and the most deprived still persists, 4. adverse events are generally felt to be acceptable. The study offers valuable insights for refining future T1D screening pro- grammes in the UK and internationally.

**Background and aims:**
Public health screening for islet autoantibod- ies was established in 2015 in Bavaria, Germany, to diagnose early- stage type 1 diabetes (multiple islet autoantibody positive). In October 2019, the screening was extended to include detection and follow-up of single islet autoantibody positivity. Screening is offered to children aged 2 to 10 years. Single islet autoantibody positivity is defined as the presence of a single confirmed-positive islet autoantibody. Early- stage type 1 diabetes (T1D) is defined as the presence of two or more confirmed-positive islet autoantibodies. Here, we assessed the preva- lence, persistence, and outcomes of single islet autoantibody positivity and progression to early-stage or clinical T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Children were screened for islet autoanti- bodies (GADA, IA-2A, ZnT8A, IAA) using ELISA and LIPS assays (>98th percentile), followed by confirmatory testing with radio-bind- ing assays (RBA). Single autoantibody positivity was determined using three to six times higher cut-offs than used for multiple islet autoantibody positivity: GADA ≥90 units (vs ≥30 units), RBA-IAA ≥9 units (vs ≥1.5 units) and LIPS-IAA ≥15 units (vs ≥4 units), IA-2A ≥9 units (vs ≥3 units). Single ZnT8A positivity was not con- sidered. Annual follow-up was recommended for single islet autoan- tibody-positive children for at least 3 years; autoantibody-negative children were advised to rescreen after 3-4 years.

**Results:**
Between October 2019 and March 2025, 104,276 chil- dren were enrolled, of whom 104,171 (99.9%) had sufficient blood samples for screening. Early-stage T1D was diagnosed in 259 (0.25%) children of whom 58 have progressed to clinical diabetes. Confirmed-positive single islet autoantibodies were detected in 116 (0.1%) children (86 GADA, 23 IAA, 7 IA-2A). During follow-up, 10 (9%) children lost islet autoantibody positivity (7 GADA, 2 IAA, 1 IA-2A), 14 (12%) developed early-stage T1D and 92 (79%) remained single autoantibody-positive of whom 4 developed clinical diabetes after a median of 1.9 years (IQR 0.9-3.3). Of 11,181 children who were autoantibody-negative in the first screen and retested at a later age, 8 (0.1%) were positive for one islet autoantibody (6 GADA, 1 IAA, 1 IA-2A) and 24 (0.21%) were diagnosed with early-stage T1D.

**Conclusion:**
Conservative identification and follow-up of children with single islet autoantibodies can detect a minority of children who will develop T1D. Rescreening identifies children with single and multiple islet autoantibodies at a similar frequency as in the first screen.

**Background and aims:**
Dysglycaemia in islet-autoantibody-positive (AB+) individuals is a key marker for identifying those at the high- est risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D) progression. While various glucose metrics have been proposed, HbA1c is widely available and familiar to clinicians. However, HbA1c distributions differ between adults and children in the general population, as HbA1c tends to increase with age due to both glycaemic and non-glycaemic factors, and type 2 diabetes is more prevalent in adults. These differences may influence the predictive value of HbA1c thresholds for T1D progression, impacting monitoring and management strategies. This study aimed to assess the effect of age on HbA1c thresholds for predicting future T1D risk in AB+ individuals.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied relatives in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study screened for autoantibodies. All AB+ individuals underwent OGTT and HbA1c measurement. T1D was defined as Tri- alNet diagnosis (via OGTT or unequivocal T1D symptoms) or HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol. Wilcoxon tests assessed HbA1c differences between adults (≥18 years old) and children. Cox proportional hazards model estimated T1D risk within age groups and log rank tests assessed dif- ferences between groups.

**Results:**
Among 6,085 islet-autoantibody-positive (AB+) individuals (1,618 adults), 29% (1,752/6,085) developed T1D, including 242 adults. Adults who progressed had a higher HbA1c at the time of islet autoanti- body detection than children (mean (SD) HbA1c: adults 36 (5.4) mmol/ mol, children 34 (4.6) mmol/mol, p < 0.001). The 12 months risk of developing clinical (stage 3) T1D increased with increasing HbA1c for both age groups. However, this relationship differed between children and adults (figure 1), with a higher level of HbA1c needed to identify adults at equivalent progression risk to children. For example, children with HbA1c at 39 mmol/mol (HbA1c threshold for defining stage 2 T1D) had a higher risk of developing T1D within 12 months, than adults (39% vs 15%. p<0.001). For adults, the equivalent HbA1c for 12 months T1D risk of 39% was 45 mmol/mol.

**Conclusion:**
HbA1c is a strong predictor of future T1D in AB+ adults and children but the impact of age on HbA1c alters interpretation of risk. Therefore, threshold adjustments are likely required to optimise HbA1c utility in guiding monitoring and management of AB+ adults. The higher HbA1c threshold needed to identify adults at equivalent progression risk to children may reflect both age-related glycaemic changes and a possible admixture of T2D pathophysiology in older AB+ individuals. Further analyses are needed to disentangle these effects and refine risk stratification in adults.

**Background and aims:**
The CLVR (Hybrid Closed Loop Therapy and Verapamil for Beta Cell Preservation in New Onset Type 1 Dia- betes) multicenter randomized controlled trial demonstrated that 52 weeks of daily oral verapamil preserved stimulated C-peptide secre- tion relative to placebo controls in children recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, mechanisms of verapamil’s impact in T1D are poorly understood. Chromogranin A is a known beta cell granule protein and T1D autoantigen, which was reduced by vera- pamil treatment in a small sample of adults with T1D. Here, we tested if chromogranin levels were impacted by verapamil treatment in a multicenter trial testing verapamil in children within 31 days of a T1D diagnosis.

**Materials and methods:**
Fasting sera from 87 children aged 7-17 years collected at study randomization, and weeks 13, 26,39, and 52 were analyzed for chromogranin A using ELISA. Chromogranin A was compared between randomized drug groups based on a longitudinal linear mixed effects model adjusted for age, days from T1D diagnosis to randomization, and clinical care group (Intensive hybrid closed loop management or standard clinical care) as fixed effects and clinical site as a random effect.

**Results:**
Chromogranin A was similar between treatment groups at baseline (12.1±1.8 ng/mL in placebo vs 14.5±1.8 ng/mL verapamil- treated) but reduced by verapamil treatment by 13 weeks and remained lower compared to placebo at all post-treatment timepoints tested (Fig- ure). By the 52-week timepoint chromogranin A levels were 9.9±1.3 ng/mL in placebo-treated vs 4.7±1.9 ng/mL in verapamil-treated par- ticipants. Baseline chromogranin A levels were not associated with treatment response or changes in C-peptide within either treatment group.

**Conclusion:**
Reductions in chromogranin A were linked to partial preservation of C-peptide by verapamil in children with recent onset T1D. These findings suggest that chromogranin A may be a clinically useful biomarker in T1D intervention trials. Further studies exploring whether this marker reflects a readout of beta cell health in T1D, or as a marker of responses to other disease-modifying therapies should be pursued.

**Background and aims:**
Zimislecel (VX-880) is an allogeneic stem cell- derived, fully-differentiated islet cell therapy in pivotal development for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here we describe continuous glucose monitor (CGM)- derived metrics from participants in the VX-880-101 (FORWARD) study.

**Materials and methods:**
The FORWARD study is a single-arm, open- label, Phase 1/2/3 study evaluating zimislecel in adults with T1D with impaired hypoglycemia awareness and recurrent severe hypoglycemic episodes (SHEs) (at least 2 SHEs during the year before screening). Enrollment in the Phase 1/2 portion is complete, and dosing in the Phase 3 portion is ongoing. Participants receive zimislecel with a standard steroid-free immunosuppression regimen and are required to use a CGM before screening and for the duration of the study.

**Results:**
As of October 2024, 22 participants have been dosed with zimislecel. Of these, 12 participants received a full dose of zimisle- cel as a single infusion and were followed for at least 1 year. Mean HbA1c for the 12 participants improved from 7.8% at baseline (BL) to 6.0% at Day[D] 365. Ten of 12 (83%) participants no longer required exogenous insulin at D365, and mean insulin dose was reduced from 40.9 IU/day at BL to 3.3 IU/day at D365. All 12 participants had clini- cally meaningful improvements in CGM metrics from baseline and met ADA/EASD endorsed targets for time-in-range, 70 to 180 mg/ dL, (BL: 49.5%, D365: 93.3%), time-above-range, >180 to 250 mg/ dL, (BL:30.1%, D365: 6.0%), and time-below-range, 54 to <70 mg/ dL, (BL:1.7%, D365: 0.3%), at D365 (Table 1). Marked improvement in glycemic variability, coefficient of variation (CV%; BL: 36.3%, D365: 20.0%) was also observed. There were no serious adverse events considered by the investigator to be related to zimislecel. Two deaths occurred; both were reported previously and unrelated to zimislecel. Overall, the safety profile is consistent with the immunosuppressive regimen and islet infusion procedure.

**Conclusion:**
A single infusion of zimislecel resulted in reductions or elimination of insulin use, reduced HbA1c, and improved CGM metrics to levels above ADA/EASD endorsed targets for time-in, -below and -above range. These data demonstrate the transformative potential of zimislecel for people with T1D experiencing SHEs.

**Background and aims:**
Antipsychotic drugs can induce insulin resistance, obesity and diabetes. However, no study yet integrated the investigation of intestinal microbiota, insulin sensitivity, and signal- ing, together with insulin secretion and islet morphology in animals treated with olanzapine or clozapine. In the present study, we investi- gated molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance, microbiota analysis, insulin secretion and islet of Langerhans electron microscopy analysis.

**Materials and methods:**
We treated mice with olanzapine or clozapine (1 mg / kg and 10 mg / kg body weight, respectively) for 30 days and then these mice were evaluated for glucose tolerance, insulin sensitiv- ity, energy expenditure, insulin signaling and islet morphology by light and electronic microscopy.

**Results:**
Olanzapine and clozapine induced glucose intolerance (30% increase in glucose AUC in the OGTT, for both olanzapine and clo- zapine, as compared to control (p<0.05), reduced insulin sensitiv- ity in the euglycemic clamp (50% decrease for olanzapine and 30% decrease for clozapine in glucose uptake as compared with control; p<0.01 and p<0.05) and insulin signalling alterations in liver, mus- cle and adipose tissue (30-50% decrease in IR and AKT phospho- rylation) by activation of serine kinase mTOR and JNK. TNFalfa, IL-6, leptin and adiponectin serum levels were not signicantly dif- ferent in the 3 experimental groups. We also assessed metabolic rates by using a Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS). After a period of adaptation, no significant alterations were observed in ­0 consumption, ­CO production and in a RER for light and dark cycles among for all group studied. Also Olanzapine and Clozapine did not result in any significant change in heat produc- tion and activity levels when compared to control mice. Olanzapine and clozapine induce microbiota modulation in mice, although this modulation likely did not cause insulin resistance, since microbiota transplantation did not show alterations in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and signaling in recipient mice. We observed a reduced insulin secretion associated with alteration in islet morphology char- acterized by reduction in beta cell mass and transition of these cells to alpha cell with, enlarged mithochondria and ER.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, clozapine and olanzapine induced severe insulin resistance with altered insulin signaling in mice, independently of the modulation of microbiota and body weight increase. The glucose intolerance induced by these drugs seems to be related also to reduced insulin secretion, accompanied by changes in endocrine cells organelles morphology in the islet of Langerhans.

2. icine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal, Polytechnic Univer-

**Background and aims:**
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are fre- quently associated with increased intestinal permeability. Poor epithe- lial barrier integrity allows the extravasation of bacterial metabolites and bacteria into circulation, which can contribute to the chronic low- grade inflammation that characterizes metabolic disease. Recent data have confirmed the presence of bacterial DNA not only in the blood but also in peripheral tissues in individuals with T2D. However, it is not known if bacterial translocation to nearby organs can happen sooner during the metabolic sequelae of obesity. Herein, we quantified the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in omental adipose tissue samples of indi- viduals with obesity but at distinct stages of metabolic dysregulation and evaluated indirect markers of intestinal permeability.

**Materials and methods:**
We extracted, under rigorous experimen- tal sterile conditions, and quantified the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in omental adipose tissue samples of individuals with obesity at distinct stages of metabolic dysregulation (n=40): insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, prediabetes, and T2D. Plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (FABP2) were determined to infer on intestinal barrier permeability.

**Results:**
Bacterial DNA was identified in the omental adipose tissue of individuals with obesity, in the range of 1-100 pg/μg of total DNA isolate, and was increased in prediabetes and T2D groups (p=0.0013 and p=0.0782 versus the insulin sensitive group). Omental bacterial DNA content was positively correlated with HbA1c and fasting gly- cemia (r=0.537, p=0.001 and r=0.467, p=0.003) and with adipose tissue expression (r=0.661, p<0.05) and plasma FABP2 levels (0.829, p<0.05) in the T2D group exclusively. Plasma FABP2 was increased in individuals with alterations in glucose metabolism [(pre- diabetes + T2D groups), p=0.0224] and was positively correlated with blood leukocytes (r=0.390, p=0.005). Plasma LBP levels were not altered, but were strongly correlated with adipose tissue inflamma- tion markers in individuals with alterations in glucose metabolism [ (r=0.766, p<0.001), (r=0.825, p<0.001), (r=0.777, p<0.001), (r=0.714, p<0.001) and (r=0.602, p<0.001)]

**Conclusion:**
Herein, we showed that bacterial DNA is present in the omental adipose tissue of individuals with obesity, and especially increased in prediabetes and T2D, and correlates with disease pro- gression, adipose tissue inflammation, and increased intestinal barrier permeability.

**Background and aims:**
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity by modulating gut microbiota composition. However, the variability in clinical out- comes and the mechanisms driving FMT-induced weight loss remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of FMT for weight loss and to investigate the role of donor-derived microbial engraftment in mediating therapeutic responses in overweight and obese individuals.

**Materials and methods:**
In this 12-week, multicenter, single-arm trial, 23 overweight and obese individuals (BMI ≥ 24 kg/m²) with- out diabetes received three biweekly FMT sessions via a nasojejunal tube. Fecal samples from both participants and donors were analyzed using metagenomic sequencing to assess microbial composition and engraftment dynamics. Participants were classified as responders if they achieved a weight loss of ≥ 5% from baseline by week 12.

**Results:**
By week 12, 52% of participants were classified as respond- ers,, achieving a mean weight loss of 7.98 ± 2.69 kg (P < 0.001), compared to a modest loss of 2.90 ± 1.89 kg in non-responders (P < 0.001). Responders exhibited a significantly higher proportion of donor-derived microbial strains post-FMT compared to non-responders (37.8% vs. 15.2%, P = 0.020). Notably, key taxa such as Phascolarc- tobacterium and Acidaminococcaceae showed a significant increase in responders post-FMT (P < 0.05 for both), indicating successful microbial engraftment as a key determinant of therapeutic success. Metagenomic analyses revealed significant enrichment of metabolic pathways in responders by week 12 such as adipocytokine signaling, thermogenesis and lipid metabolism, suggesting that these functional shifts further contribute to the weight loss observed.

**Conclusion:**
FMT is a promising intervention for weight loss, with donor-derived microbial engraftment playing a pivotal role in medi- ating treatment efficacy. The strong correlation between engraftment success and weight loss underscores the potential of microbiota- targeted therapies in obesity management and provides mechanistic insights into FMT outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by substantial bio-clinical diversity. While many strategies of classifications of T2D have been proposed, none incorporate inflammatory parameters, despite the critical role of inflammation in T2D pathogenesis. This study aim to integrate cir- culating immune cells (CIC) profiling to define novel T2D endo- types with distinct immuno-inflammatory profiles, assess endotype stability throughout T2D progression, identify their biomarkers and investigate their trajectories toward complications.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 1500 newly-diagnosed T2D participants were recruited from three cohorts accross France, Italy and Germany. An unsupervised clustering method (k-means) based on CIC counts (neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) was applied to identify T2D endotypes. To validate model stability and assess endotype trajectories toward complications, six longi- tudinal cohorts comprising totally 75 000 T2D participants were projected onto the model. Multi-omics analyses, including targeted proteomics and transcriptomics at both bulk and single-cell levels, were conducted to characterize the immune response across these endotypes.

**Results:**
The newly-diagnosed T2D population comprised 68% male participants, with a median age of 50-60 years, HbA1c of 6.9%, and BMI of 28.7 kg/m². Four endotypes were identified, differentiated by variations in CIC concentrations and specific plasma proteins. Individual immune cell counts remain stable over a 10-year follow- up, delineating a persistent immune profile during T2D progression. Two distinct endotypes, representing 19% and 24%, demonstrated an elevated development toward cardiovascular outcomes and nephropa- thy. Notably, one of these high-risk endotypes displayed a unique immune response predominantly driven by an enrichment of a clas- sical monocyte subpopulation, characterized by SIGLEC signature and activation of the interferon pathway.

**Conclusion:**
Incorporating CIC numeration into a T2D endotyp- ing algorithm refines the T2D stratification and identifies inflamma- tory endotypes. These "highly inflamed" T2D individuals exhibit an increased susceptibility to diabetes-related complications, underscor- ing the clinical significance of immuno-inflammatory profiling in T2D management.

**Depletion of adipocyte perilipin 5 leads to intestinal mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation via modulating gut microbiota in obese mice**

J. Zhang, N. Hou, X. Sun

**Background and aims:**
Obesity has become a serious public health problem worldwide. The imbalance of intestinal homeostasis caused by intestinal flora disorders and barrier dysfunction is an important initial enabling step for obesity-related systemic injury. Perilipin 5 (Plin5) occupies an important position in the regulation of lipid stor- age and fatty acid release in adipose tissue. However, its role and mechanism in the regulation of obesity-associated intestinal homeosta- sis imbalance remains elusive. Thus, this study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of adipocyte Plin5 on intestinal flora and barrier function in obesity mice and to provide a new perspective regarding “adipose tissue-gut” axis for the prevention and treatment of obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
Adipose-specific Plin5 knockout mice ­(Plin5 ) were used as study subjects, and ­Plin5 ­(Plin5 ) mice were used as controls. Six-week-old male mice were fed either a nor- mal chow diet (NC) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks. Body weight was measured weekly, and body composition was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance every 4 weeks. Adipose tissue and liver morphol- ogy was analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Blood parameters and liver triglyceride were measured by the enzymatic assay. Intesti- nal contents were taken for 16S rRNA macrogenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. Colon tissues were used for transcriptome sequencing analysis. Animal care and experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of a medical university.

**Results:**
In the present study, the depletion of adipocyte Plin5 has no significant changes in metabolic profiles, including body weight, body fat and insulin resistance index during obesity. However, adi- pocyte-specific Plin5 knockout mice develops larger BAT and eWAT adipocytes and increases triglyceride levels in both serum and liver in HFD group. Ablation of Plin5 in adipocyte stimulates the increase of and elevates gut contents metabolites enriched in steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway during obesity. Furthermore, down-regulated differential genes in colon tissues of ­Plin5 obese mice were significantly enriched in mitochondrial oxidative phospho- rylation function, while the up-regulated differential genes are enriched for activation of the intestinal immune response.

**Conclusion:**
The depletion of adipocyte Plin5 exacerbates brown fat whitening and hepatic steatosis in obese mice, leading to colonic oxida- tive phosphorylation dysfunction and inflammation response by target- ing -regulated biosynthesis of steroid hormone- related metabolites. These findings imply that adipocyte Plin5 would serve as a crucial player for obesity-associated intestinal homeostasis.

**Background and aims:**
Bariatric and metabolic surgeries are effec- tive treatments for type 2 diabetes in individuals with severe obesity, resulting in lasting weight loss, improved glycemic control and diabe- tes remission. However, limited studies have examined the long-term impact of bariatric surgery on the specific composition of blood lipids. This study aimed to i) identify characteristic longitudinal lipidomic signatures following bariatric surgery, ii) correlate discriminant lipids with relevant clinical parameters, and iii) use these signatures to predict diabetes remission.

**Materials and methods:**
The REMISSION study followed 13 men and 32 women (age: 50.6 ± 6.2 years; BMI: 45.0± 5.9 kg/m ) with type 2 diabetes who underwent bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch). Patients were followed over a three-year period, during which diabetes remission was evaluated according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery outcome reporting standards. Plasma samples were collected for mass spectrometry-based untargeted lipidomic analyses to evaluate circulating lipid levels at baseline (pre- surgery), and at 4, 12, 24 and 36 months post-surgery. Samples were analyzed in positive scan mode. Statistical analyses were performed to identify lipid features exhibiting significant longitudinal variation (linear regression) and to compare lipid profiles at each post-operative time point to baseline (t-tests). Lipid features associated with diabetes remission status at 36 months (linear regression; improvement, partial or complete remission; n=177 features) were subsequently annotated using tandem mass spectrometry.

**Results:**
Principal component analyses revealed distinct lipid signatures stratified for time, diabetes remission status or surgical procedure. After adjusting for age, sex and weight loss, phosphatidylinositols (PI) were significantly increased in patients achieving partial and complete remis- sion of T2D. PI negatively correlated with HbA1c (-0.54<r<-0.34; p<0.03) and C-peptide (-0.42<r<-0.26; p<0.03). Oxidized triglycer- ides (TG-O), whose identity remains to be further validated, showed differential associations based on the number of double bonds within their oxidized fatty acid ester moiety; TG 18:2-O negatively associated with HbA1c (-0.44<r<-0.36; p<0.03) and C-peptide (-0.45<r<-0.30; p<0.02), while TG 18:3-O positively correlated with both (HbA1c: 0.44<r<0.48; p<0.02 and C-peptide 0.37<r<0.39; p<0.03). Ceramides exhibited a positive correlation with HbA1c (0.22<r<0.57; p<0.001), while hexosylceramide (HexCer) and monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3) showed a negative correlation (-0.65<r<-0.40; p<0.01).

**Conclusion:**
PIs are known to be involved in β-cell function and dysfunction; however, associations of TG-O with diabetes have not been previously reported, and their role in disease remission warrants further investigation

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steato- hepatitis (MASH) is a disease that often coexists with obesity. In light of the recent recommendations from the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) and the Lancet Commission on the definition and diagnostic criteria of clinical obesity to shift the focus on the complexity of obesity rather than relying entirely on BMI, we explored the association between adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction and MASH severity, in relation to both BMI and insulin resistance.

**Materials and methods:**
AT dysfunction (MCP-1, TNF-α, leptin, adiponectin), insulin resistance (AT-IR=FFA x insulin and HOMA- IR) and hepatic lipid oxidation (β-hydroxybutyrate, BHB) were eval- uated in 354 individuals from the European SLD (MASLD) Registry with biopsy-proven metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. MASLD severity was evaluated in terms of fibrosis stage and activity score. Multivariable regression and mediation analysis were used to elucidate direct and indirect associations.

**Results:**
The cohort included individuals (36% females) with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D, 55% vs 45% respectively) and with a wide range of BMI (20-60 kg/m ), ranging across the full spec- trum of MASLD (65% MASH, 56% with significant fibrosis[F≥2]). Markers of AT inflammation were significantly altered in presence of significant fibrosis (increased TNF-α and MCP-1) and activ- ity score ≥2 (increased MCP1 and decreased adiponectin). Such associations were independent of BMI or presence of T2D. On the contrary, FFA and BHB were not associated with MASLD severity or BMI, but BHB levels were increased with T2D and FFA. Insu- lin resistance indexes (AT-IR and HOMA-IR) were also increased with the histological severity of MASH and showed a strong cor- relation with adipokines’ levels. Mediation analysis revealed that insulin resistance (AT-IR and HOMA-IR), not BMI, significantly mediated the association between AT dysfunction (MCP-1 and TNF- α) and MASH severity. Nevertheless, the direct association of AT dysfunction with MASLD severity remained significant independent of insulin resistance.

**Conclusion:**
MASH severity is not strictly linked to BMI, but rather to dysfunctional adipose tissue and insulin resistance. Moving toward a holistic phenotyping of individuals with MASLD is essential to improve risk stratification and targeted interventions.

**Background and aims:**
The diagnosis of severe liver disease (SLD) in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is often made late due to the long asymptomatic stages of progressive fibrosis. We aimed to identify metabolomic profiles associated with SLD in patients with NAFLD and develop a metabolomic-based model to predict SLD onset.

**Materials and methods:**
We used data from 59,579 NAFLD participants in the UK Biobank, evaluating the incidence of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or liver transplantation dur- ing a median follow-up period of 14.1 years. Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to evaluate the associations between individual metabolites and SLD risk. Light gradient-boosting machine was used to determine the optimal metabolite panel for construction of the metabolomic score. Finally, a metabolomics-integrated nomogram prediction model was developed and compared with conventional risk factors and scoring systems.

**Results:**
After adjustment for covariates, 110 of 249 metabolites were associated with the risk of incident SLD. Based on the machine-learning approach, 11 metabolic biomarkers were prioritized as predictors to con- struct the metabolomic score. The nomogram integrating metabolomic score, gamma glutamyltransferase, platelet count, waist/hip ratio, diabetes mellitus, and sex showed better predictive capacity of 10-year SLD risk (area under the receiver operating characteristic 0.841 [95% CI: 0.800- 0.881]) than the fibrosis-4 index (0.712, 0.662-0.763), NAFLD fibrosis score (0.659, 0.609-0.709), and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (0.705, 0.652-0.759) in the validation cohort. Participants categorized by the nomogram’s optimal cutoffs showed distinct cumula- tive SLD risk, with the high-risk group having a hazard ratio of 27.08 (95% CI: 18.23-40.22) compared to the low-risk group.

**Conclusion:**
Integration of metabolomics with routine demographic and laboratory indicators improved predictive performance for risk stratifica- tion of SLD outcomes in NAFLD patients, which may contribute to early screening and precise interventions.

**Background and aims:**
Dietary fructose intake has increased in recent decades and is linked to the rising incidence of metabolic dysfunc- tion-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). MASLD increases risks for liver-related complications and cardiometabolic disease. As improved understanding of drivers in MASLD pathophysiology is cru- cial, this study aims to identify fructose-associated gene expression changes related to MASLD by analyzing RNA-seq data.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from the BARIA study, a prospective bariatric surgery cohort. RNA-seq was performed on liver, jejunum and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) biopsies obtained dur- ing surgery. Plasma fructose levels were measured in 39 subjects both fasting and 2h post-meal in a preoperative mixed meal test (MMT), as well as intraoperatively in peripheral and portal vein blood in 38 sub- jects. Two fructose variables were assessed: peripheral plasma fructose change during MMT (set 1) and intraoperative peripheral-portal plasma difference (set 2). Differential gene expression analysis was performed for each tissue using DESeq2 with both variables. Significant differ- entially expressed genes (DEGs) ( -adjusted <0.05, Log2FoldChange ≥1) identified in both sets were further analyzed.

**Results:**
In sets 1 and 2, 82.1% and 81.6% of subjects were female, with 59.0% and 57.9% having MASLD, respectively. Median age [IQR] was 49 years [36-55] in set 1 and 48 years [38-55] in set 2. Median BMI [IQR] was 38.0 kg/m [37.0-40.5] in set 1 and 38.0 kg/ m [36.3-39.8] in set 2. In the liver, 59 upregulated and 35 down- regulated DEGs were identified in both sets. In jejunum, 183 up- and 35 downregulated DEGs were found, while in VAT only 7 up- and 9 downregulated DEGs. KEGG analysis showed MASLD pathway upregulation in liver. GSTM1 was among the most downregulated DEGs in liver, whereas SQSTM1/p62 was the top upregulated DEG in VAT and CTSB the second most upregulated gene in jejunum. In a larger group of BARIA subjects (n=298), median GSTM1 expression in liver was lower in MASLD subjects than in non-MASLD subjects ( =0.03) and median p62 expression in VAT (n=291) was higher in MASLD subjects ( =0.009). Ordinal logistic regression showed that higher p62 expression in VAT correlated with a higher steatosis grade (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.32, =0.034).

**Conclusion:**
In morbidly obese subjects, higher peripheral fructose excursion during a MMT and greater peripheral-portal fructose differ- ence, indicating higher liver fructose exposure, were associated with MASLD pathway upregulation in liver. At the gene level, higher fruc- tose exposure associated with GSTM1 downregulation in liver and p62 upregulation in VAT. MASLD subjects had lower GSTM1 and higher p62 expression than non-MASLD subjects, and p62 expression correlated with steatosis grade. CTSB expression in jejunum did not correlate with MASLD or steatosis grade, possibly due to poor jeju- num RNA-seq data quality, though prior studies linked cathepsin B to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and MASLD/MASH progression. This study underscores dietary fructose’s role in MASLD and identifies potential targets in fructose-driven MASLD pathophysiology.

**Background and aims:**
Non-obese metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a specific metabolic liver injury with multi-organ effects. Currently, the biomarkers and predictive models of staging and transition in non-obese MASLD are poorly understood. The aims were to explore non-obese MASLD grading and regression-related protein features and their predictive models using longitudinal proteomic and liver imaging data.

**Materials and methods:**
The study included participants aged 40-75 years from the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study (GNHS). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate MASLD grading for 1,048 participants (620 HC, 213 mild, 215 moderate and severe). The prospective study included 1,916 participants (728 non- obese MASLD, 1,188 controls) were assessed by ultrasonography (UltS), and transition outcomes of disease statuses were explored across three follow-up waves (1~3) over 9 years. Serum proteomics with 413 proteins was profiled by LC-MS/MS at three time points. Light Gradient Boosting Machin (LightGBM) and SHapleyAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to identify key proteins, and the predictive capacity was evaluated by ROC curve. The Cox propor- tional-hazards models and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to estimate the prospective and longitudinal associations, respectively.

**Results:**
LightGBM model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, achieving AUC values of 0.82 for non-obese MASLD using 30 key proteins. SHBG, APOF, APOD, and APOM showed strong inverse correlations with non-obese MASLD risk, while C3 and VTN exhib- ited positive correlations. These proteins predicted mild and moderate- to-severe MASLD with AUC values of 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. Prospective analysis identified seven proteins (APOF, AFM, SHBG, CP, MRPL19, ITIH3, and VTN) significantly associated with incident MASLD risk (AUC = 0.86). Longitudinal analysis revealed dynamic protein changes, with higher protein scores linked to risk of MASLD (HR = 9.67, p < 0.001). The LightGBM model achieved exceptional AUC values of 0.94, 0.98, and 0.94 for predicting MASLD progression, alleviation, and persistence, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
This study identified serum proteins, particularly SHBG, APOF, APOD, APOM, C3, VTN, and AFM, as robust biomarkers for non-obese MASLD risk stratification, and progression prediction. Machine learning models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, highlighting the potential of serum proteomics in advancing precision medicine for non-obese MASLD management.

3. sinki, Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.

**Background and aims:**
Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, MASLD persists in 7-12 % of patients after BS. To eluci- date the underlying metabolism, we investigated which plasma metabo- lites associate with 1) severity, 2) improvement and 3) persistence of MASLD after BS. We asked whether the identified metabolites repli- cate in a mouse model of MASLD. Finally, we investigated in the UK Biobank (UKB) whether the identified metabolites predict incident clinical outcomes, such as SLD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

**Materials and methods:**
We assigned 84 BS patients (mean age 52.8 years, 70.2 % women) into three groups based on baseline liver histol- ogy. The control group (n = 28) had healthy livers, the MASL group (n = 26) had steatosis, and the MASH group (n = 30) had steatohepatitis and/or fibrosis. After an average of 7.7 years, we invited the patients for a follow-up visit, during which liver stiffness (LS) was measured using transient elastography. At both baseline and follow-up, 249 plasma metabolites were quantified using nuclear magnetic resonance. We fed C57BL/6J mice (n = 18) either the Gubra Amylin NASH (GAN) diet or chow for 16 weeks, after which we extracted their livers for histol- ogy and metabolomics. In the UKB (N = 101,153), we conducted Cox regressions adjusted for age, sex and BMI to evaluate whether baseline plasma metabolites predict incident SLD, ASCVD and T2D.

**Results:**
The control, MASL, and MASH groups had similar age, sex, and BMI. At follow-up, body weights had decreased by 20.1 % (p < 0.0001) similarly in all groups. Thirteen plasma metabolites distin- guished the groups at baseline, of which four improved after BS (p < 0.05). LS was high (> 8 kPa) in 10.7 % of patients after BS. Only one of the four metabolites differentiated patients with high LS from those without (p < 0.05). This metabolite - an amino acid - associ- ated inversely with hepatic and adipose tissue insulin resistance (p < 0.05). The concentration of the amino acid decreased by 47.3 % in the GAN-fed mouse livers compared to controls and correlated inversely with severity of MASLD (p < 0.001). In the UKB, the amino acid predicted reduced liver fat content (beta = -0.11, p < 0.0001) and protected against incident MASLD, alcohol-related liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 0.53-0.87, p < 0.005) as well as ASCVD (acute myocardial infarction, HR 0.91, p = 0.0002), and T2D (HR 0.83, p < 0.0001) and its complications such as retinopa- thy, neuropathy and peripheral angiopathy (HR 0.72-0.78, p < 0.01). The amino acid concentrations associated positively with intakes of vegetable protein (beta = 0.07, p < 0.0001) and negatively with animal protein (beta = -0.12, p < 0.0001).

**Conclusion:**
We identified an amino acid which: 1) associates with reduced histological severity of MASLD, 2) increases after BS, 3) is lower in patients with high LS after BS compared to those without, 4) decreases in a mouse model of MASLD, 5) predicts reduced risk of clinical outcomes, including SLD, ASCVD, and T2D, and 6) associ- ates with dietary factors. These data suggest that this amino acid may protect against MASLD, ASCVD and T2D.

**A metabolome-derived classification of metabolic dysfunction- associated fatty liver disease**

M.-F. Xia

**Background and aims:**
MASLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease) is a significant complication of type 2 diabetes, which affects ~25% of the world’s population. MASLD is associated with increased risk of overall, diabetes-related and cardiovascular mor- tality. At present, resmetirom is the only approved drug for MASLD and the response rate is only 30%, probably due to the heterogeneity of MASLD. Our previous studies indicated that MASLD with PNPLA3 gene variant or sarcopenia had distinct circulating metabolomic profiles. In the current study, we aimed to identify different types of MASLD by using a data-driven cluster analysis of metabolomic param- eters in order to facilitate individual prognostic prediction and guide personalized treatment of MASLD.

**Materials and methods:**
The metabolome-derived classification of MASLD was established in a discovery cohort of 241 Chinese patients with biopsy-confirmed MASLD and then validated in 8623 MASLD patients from Shanghai Changfeng and UK Biobank cohorts. The meta- bolic, metabolomic and all-cause and cause-specific mortality were compared among the patients with different types of MASLD.

**Results:**
A total of 39 clinical parameters and 149 serum metabolits were significantly associated with the severity of MASLD in the Chi- nese liver biopsy cohort. Using a feature selection machine learning strategy, we identified five most relevant feature variables of MASLD, which included AST, AST/ALT ratio, uric acid, acetoacetate and tyrosine. Cluster analysis based on the above five parameters was per- formed and we determined the optimal number of clusters by choos- ing the configuration that yielded the highest silhouette coefficients. Four clusters were identified: cluster 1 contained 21% of participants and was characterized by high AST and tyrosine levels and highest proportion of MASH, PNPLA3 gene variant; cluster 2 included 25% of participants and had highest levels of serum acetoacetate and uric acid and high proportion of type 2 diabetes and GCKR gene variant; cluster 3 had 44% of participants and low levels of all five parameters; cluster 4 had 10% of participants and high AST/ALT ratio (Fig 1A). We then validated the metabolome-derived classification in 8623 MASLD patients from Shanghai Changfeng and UK Biobank cohorts and found the patients can also be divided into four types consistently. Cox pro- portional hazard analysis indicated that the all-cause and cause-specific mortality was different among different types of MASLD. MASLD patients within cluster 2 had higher cardiovascular, liver-related and diabetes-related mortality (all P<0.05, Figure 1B-D). Moreover, the patients within cluster 1 had a trend of higher liver-related and those within cluster 3 had a trend of higher cardiovascular mortality than cluster 4 (P =0.064 and 0.079, respectively, Figure 1B&C).

**Conclusion:**
Our study unveiled the existence of four types of MASLD with distinct metabolic/metabolomic features as well as cardiovascular, liver-related and diabetes-related mortality. This may be valuable to guide personalized management of MASLD.

**Long-term incidence and case-fatality rates of myocardial infarc- tion in people with newly diagnosed diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance: the Da Qing Diabetes 34-year follow-up**

J. Xu

**Background and aims:**
Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the major cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. However, there is a scarcity of follow-up data especially beyond 30 years and in those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) remain limited. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and case-fatality rates (CFR) of MI across a 34-year follow-up among adults newly diagnosis diabetes (NDD), IGT and normal glucose tolerance (NGT).

**Materials and methods:**
The study followed 1,632 participants in Da Qing city, China, over a period of up to 34 years since their initial identification in 1986. The participants were categorized as follows: 598 with newly diagnosed diabetes, 405 with impaired glu- cose tolerance who received lifestyle intervention for six years, 135 IGT individuals without intervention, and 494 with normal glucose tolerance. We compared incidence and hazard ratios for MI across these groups and estimated the difference of median delay time of MI onset from parametric Weibull distribution models. Moreover, we calculated the case-fatality rates of MI and analyzed the mortality risk after MI among these groups.

**Results:**
During the 34-year follow-up, in NDD, IGT-non-interven- tion, IGT-intervention, and NGT groups, the cumulative incidence of MI was 46.4%, 31.8%, 24.0%, and 16.7%, respectively. The MI incidence rates were 14.3, 9.6, 7.1, and 4.9 per 1000 person-years. Compared with the NDD group, the median delay to the onset of MI was 16.82 years in the NGT group, 7.84 years in the IGT-inter- vention group, and 2.28 years in the IGT-non-intervention group. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, smoking and total cholesterol and medications, the risk for MI were significantly higher in the NDD group (HR: 3.54; 95% CI: 2.59-4.83), IGT-non-inter- vention group (HR: 2.34; 95% CI: 1.52-3.70), and IGT-intervention group (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.32-2.64) compared to the NGT group. Moreover, compared to the NDD group, the incidence of MI was significantly lower in the IGT-intervention group (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.42-0.73), while the IGT-non-intervention group (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.47-1.00) showed no significant difference. Case-fatality rates (CFR) from MI (per 100 person-years) were 39.50(31.76-472.42) in the NDD group, 9.84(5.63-140.48) and 31.64(17.03-462.65) in IGT with and without intervention groups, and 14.46(7.96-209.64) in the NGT group. After adjustment for multiple risk factors, the case-fatality for MI was significantly higher in individuals with NDD (1.62; 95% CI: 1.14-2.28) and showed an increased trend in those with IGT without intervention (1.50; 95% CI: 0.92-2.47) compared to NGT participants. Conversely, individuals with IGT who received a 6-year lifestyle intervention demonstrated a lower CFR (0.83; 95% CI: 0.54-1.27), indicating a potential protective effect.

**Conclusion:**
The present long-term follow-up study demonstrated that individuals with NDD and IGT had a significantly higher incidence and risk of MI, as well as increased post-MI mortality. Notably, early life- style intervention in individuals with IGT to prevent the onset of dia- betes was effective in reducing both the occurrence and fatality of MI.

**The acute molecular effects of five dietary pattern revealed by a prospective proteomics study**

T. Zhang

**Background and aims:**
Diet profoundly impacts health, yet its acute molecular effects remain underexplored.

**Materials and methods:**
In this prospective study, 20 healthy volun- teers underwent sequential interventions with a single breakfast con- sisting of five dietary patterns: ketogenic, low-fat low-calorie (LFLC), high-fat high-calorie (HFHC), high-glucose, and normal diets. Follow- ing these dietary interventions, proteomic analyses were conducted on 500 plasma samples and 500 urine samples.

**Results:**
The ketogenic diet increased inflammation and oxidative stress, upregulating PPBP, SRGN, GSTO1 and BLVRB. The HFHC diet upregulated JUP, DSP and APOA5, influencing lipid metabo- lism and cell adhesion, while concurrently downregulating TAGLN2, RAP1B, and TMSB4X, impacting cytoskeletal and endothelial func- tions. Ketogenic, HFHC, and high-glucose diets elevated markers linked to atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases risk. TGM2, which showed a significant increase after the ketogenic diet, was newly identified as causally associated with coronary artery disease in our Mendelian randomization studies. Long-term HFHC feeding in mice confirmed persistent inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Over- weight individuals exhibited a higher baseline inflammation and unique metabolic responses post-intervention compared to those with normal weight.

**Conclusion:**
These findings highlight the significant impact of dietary patterns on proteomic profiles, offering valuable insights for the for- mulation of dietary recommendations to improve metabolic health and reduce disease risk.

**Long-term impact of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular events and atherosclerotic complications in patients with and without type 2 diabetes**

D. Moriconi, ini, M. Nannipieri

**Background and aims:**
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are major cardiovascular risk factors. Bariatric surgery (BS) improves metabolic control, but its long-term effect on cardiovascular events and athero- sclerosis, particularly in relation to T2D remission, remains unclear. This study assesses the impact of BS on cardiovascular ischemic events and macrovascular complications in patients with and without T2D remission after BS, compared to medical therapy, in a well-character- ized cohort with comprehensive evaluation.

**Materials and methods:**
Observational study (started in 2012), enroll- ing 400 subjects<70 years, with complete annual clinical, laboratory, and instrumental assessments for ≥5 years (mean 8.3 ± 2.1 years). The cohort included 132 T2D patients on medical therapy (MT) and 268 who underwent BS, of whom 124 had T2D BAR-T2D and 144 did not (BAR). A biennial cardiac stress test was performed, followed by further evaluations for positive high Duke Treadmill Score. The primary outcome was a composite of acute coronary syndrome, car- diovascular death, or asymptomatic coronary artery disease confirmed by angiography. Secondary outcome was the progression of carotid atherosclerosis (IMT). Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess cardiovascular outcomes adjusting for confounders. A lin- ear mixed-effects model analysed carotid atherosclerosis progression. In both analyses, LDL and HbA1c were modelled as time-dependent covariates to account for longitudinal variations.

**Results:**
The primary outcome occurred in 40 patients: 21 (16%) MT, 14 (11%) BAR-T2D, 5 (3%) BAR. The univariable Cox model showed a difference between the groups (p=0.011), with the BAR having a significantly lower HR compared to the MT and BAR-T2D groups. After adjusting for age, sex, and longitudinal changes in LDL (Model 1) or HbA1c (Model 2), the group variable lost statistical significance (p=0.27 and p=0.17, respectively). Interestingly, when the BAR-T2D group was stratified into patients with remission after bariatric sur- gery (n=96) and non-remitters (n=28), remission was associated with fewer events (5% vs. 32% in non-remitters, p=0.003). After adjusting a Cox model for age and sex, the difference in events between the two groups remained significant (HR=0.27, 95%CI[0.12-0.78], p= 0.029). Conversely, in a sub-analysis of non-remitter BAR-T2D vs MT, no sig- nificant difference in events was found after adjusting for age and sex. Carotid stenosis at baseline was significantly lower in BAR (0.89±0.3 mm) compared to BAR-T2D and MT (1.14 ±0.4 and 1.13±0.4 mm, respectively), p=0.006. Over time, IMT increased similarly across groups 1.10±0.4, 1.32±0.7 and 1.35±0.7 for BAR, BAR-T2D, and MT, respectively, p time*groups=0.62). Multivariable mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex, longitudinal changes HbA1c showed an increase in IMT progression in MT compared to BAR-T2D remitters (p group*time= 0.047). Similar results were found with regard to the percentage of carotid stenosis.

**Conclusion:**
Bariatric surgery does not appear to lower the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients without T2D remission compared to medical therapy. However, patients with T2D remission following surgery had a lower incidence of cardiovascular events and carotid atherosclerosis. These findings underscore the central role of long- term metabolic control and the need for sustained cardiovascular risk management beyond surgery.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a strong risk factor of stroke and stroke-related disabilities. This creates a rising medical need to cure stroke sequelae in this population. Hyperglycemia (HG) and insulin resistance (IR) before stroke independently correlate with poor stroke outcome in T2D. However, the causative role of both metabolic derangements to worsen stroke outcome is unknown. Filling this gap is fundamental for identifying the most effective anti-T2D strategy in people with T2D at high risk to suffer from stroke. Using an experi- mental model of T2D we determined the potential efficacy of selec- tively normalizing HG or IR before stroke to improve stroke outcome.

**Materials and methods:**
Male, obese/T2D (6 months of high fat diet, body weight > 50g, fasting glucose > 7mmol/L) C57bl6j mice were treated with insulin (n=9, 20U/kg, s.c. twice daily) to reduce HG without affecting insulin sensitivity or a long acting glucagon agonist BI02130086, (n=10, 100 nmol/kg, s.c. daily) to improve insulin sensitiv- ity (by weight loss) while maintaining HG. Vehicle treated obese/T2D (n=20), and lean (n=18) mice were used as controls.Stroke was induced by 35-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion 72 hours after the last treatment to avoid potential acute neuroprotective effects of the drugs. Functional recovery was assessed by measuring forelimb grip strength at day 3, and weeks 1, 3 and 4 after stroke. Stroke damage (NeuN) and neuroinflammation (Iba1) were assessed by immunohistochemistry.

**Results:**
Glucagon induced ≈30% weight loss (from 51±3g to 34±2g; all data values mean +SD), improved IR (p<0.001) and reduced serum insulin (1±0.5 ng/ml vs 7±3 in T2D controls p<0.05) without affecting HG, while insulin only reduced HbA1C (25±2 mmol/mol vs. 28±5 mmol/mol in T2D controls p<0.001). These results show that we validated a suitable experimental model to test the study hypothesis. No differences in stroke volume were observed between the groups. Stroke similarly reduced grip strength in all groups from 103±5 g/force at baseline to 65±2 g/force at 3 days after stroke. However, lean mice recovered grip strength fully in 4 weeks to103±4 g/force, whereas the T2D controls only improved to 82±3 g/ force (p<0.0001). Insulin treatment did not improve grip strength vs. T2D controls (85±2 vs. 82±3 g/force) despite reduced HG. Gluca- gon, on the other hand, improved grip strength fully to 100±2 g/ force (p<0.001 vs T2D controls and p<0.01 vs insulin). These data demonstrate that the pre-stroke normalization of HG alone in T2D is insufficient to improve stroke outcome. Instead, the normalization of IR improves functional recovery despite persistent HG.We also show that glucagon reduced post-stroke neuroinflammation by 40% (arbitrary units p<0.05 vs T2D controls and vs insulin), indicating that the improved neurological recovery by pre-stroke IR normaliza- tion was associated with reduced neuroinflammation.

**Conclusion:**
The results of this study demonstrate that normalizing IR before stroke in T2D e.g. via weight management is more important than glycemic control aiming to improve functional recovery after stroke. Our data strongly motivate to clinically explore treatments with insulin- sensitizing properties for people with T2D at high stroke risk; this in the preventive perspective to improve their stroke prognosis.

**Background and aims:**
While Body Mass Index (BMI) is commonly used for diagnosing obesity, it does not capture the amount and distri- bution of body fat accurately. This study evaluated a new obesity clas- sification system that combines body fat percentage (BF%) and waist circumference (WC) to predict cardiometabolic and kidney outcomes. The analysis used longitudinal health record data from the UK Biobank (UKB) study. We also explored the genetic and proteomic signatures associated with different risk groups to provide insights into the under- lying pathophysiological mechanisms.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 332,136 UKB participants with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² were categorized into five risk groups (Groups 1-5, in ascending order of predicted risk) based on the BF%-WC classification system. The prognostic values of these risk groups were assessed by ana- lyzing their associations with three-point major adverse cardiovascular events (3P-MACE), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) through cumulative incidence rates and multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Comparison was also made with the more accessible BMI-WC classification system. Polygenic scores (PGS) for T2D-related traits and plasma proteomic profiling were analyzed to iden- tify the molecular pathways underlying the elevated obesity-related risks.

**Results:**
Significant differences were observed between high- and low-risk groups in cardiovascular and kidney outcomes over a median follow-up of 13.6 years. Notably, Group 5 (N = 154,118; 46%) showed significantly elevated risks for incident 3P-MACE (HR: 1.58, 95% CI 1.40-1.75), T2D (HR: 7.09, 95% CI 6.10-8.22), and CKD (HR: 1.43, 95% CI 1.30-1.63) compared to Group 1. A similar risk distribution was observed for the BMI-WC classification, with gradually increas- ing cumulative incidence across risk groups for all three endpoints (log-rank < 0.001). Polygenic score (PGS) analysis indicated that individuals with incident T2D in high-risk groups were associated with obesity-related genetic profiles, while low-risk groups correlated with PGS for beta-cell function. Proteomic profiling highlighted inflam- mation-related pathways as dominant signatures in high-risk groups.

**Conclusion:**
This study validates the prognostic value of the BF%-WC clas- sification system for assessing adiposity-driven risks of developing cardio- metabolic and kidney disease. Similar performance was also observed for the BMI-WC classification. These findings emphasize the clinical value of a more nuanced obesity classification for improving risk prediction and advancing the molecular understanding of obesity-related comorbidities, paving the way for more targeted prevention and treatment strategies in obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic abnormalities in diabetic patients are closely related to cardiovascular events and mortality risks. Arm circumference (AC) and arm circumference-to-weight ratio (ACW) have been widely studied for their associations with metabolic risks. Triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), an effective marker for insulin resist- ance (IR), has potential clinical value in managing diabetes. This study assessed the predictive value of TyG-ACW (a combined index of TyG and ACW) for coronary heart disease (CHD), all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from the 2003-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used, includ- ing 1,892 diabetic patients aged ≥20 years. Associations between AC, ACW, TyG, and their combinations with clinical outcomes were analyzed using quartile-based and continuous variable models. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Restricted cubic splines assessed nonlinear relationships, and Kaplan-Meier curves evaluated survival differences across groups.

**Results:**
In the continuous variable analysis, AC and ACW were inversely associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, while TyG showed a potential positive association with CHD risk. Specifi- cally, for all-cause mortality, AC, ACW, TyG, and TyG-AC were sig- nificantly associated with increased mortality risk. For cardiovascular mortality, AC, ACW, and TyG-AC also demonstrated significant asso- ciations with risk. In the quartile analysis, the highest quartile (T3) of TyG-ACW was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR=2.64, 95% CI: 1.34-4.39) and cardiovascular mortality (HR=2.64, 95% CI: 1.01-6.90), with significantly higher risks for CHD, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality in the T3 group compared to the lowest quartile (T1). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the survival rate in the T3 group of TyG-ACW was significantly lower than in T1 and T2 groups, particularly for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, supporting TyG-ACW as an effective predictor of cardiovascular and mortality risks.

**Conclusion:**
TyG-ACW, as a novel combined index integrating body composition and metabolic status, can effectively predict the risks of coronary heart disease, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortal- ity in diabetic patients. This index holds potential clinical application value for risk stratification and personalized management in diabetes care. Future studies should further validate the role of TyG-ACW in improving prognostic management for diabetic patients.

**Background and aims:**
Sweden has the second highest global inci- dence of type 1 diabetes (T1D), with geographical variation suggesting environmental risk factors. Previous studies have focused on patient location at birth or diagnosis. This study explores T1D incidence in Sweden with high spatio-temporal resolution, following patients from birth to diagnosis to identify high- and low-risk clusters over different life periods.

**Materials and methods:**
All patients diagnosed with T1D during 2005-2022 (ages 0-30 years) were identified in the Swedish National Diabetes Register. All residential addresses from birth to diagnosis were then identified by Statistics Sweden. Spatio-temporal scan sta- tistics were used to identify significant high- and low-risk clusters (details in Fig. legend). A zonal statistics analysis was used to iden- tify the land use / land cover characteristics of all clusters.

**Results:**
21,774 patients aged 0 to 30 years were diagnosed with T1D 2005-2022, 57.7 % male; 15,426 were <18 years at onset. The mean age at diagnosis was 13.6 yrs (males 14.1, females 12.9). 24 % of patients had relocated to a different municipality from birth to diag- nosis. Based on the residential location of all patients at T1D-onset, 4 significant high-risk clusters were identified, all located centrally in the country, exhibiting a relative risk (RR) from 1.3 to 1.8 com- pared to expected number of cases (Fig 1a). No high-risk clusters were observed in major cities. On the contrary, significant low-risk clusters were found in the largest cities, RR 0.5 to 0.8 (Fig 1b). Based on the main residential location during the first 5 years of life (regardless of age of diagnosis), 11 high-risk clusters were identified, RR 1.2 to 2.7 (Fig 2a). The northern regions had the highest RRs. For the same time period, 15 low-risk clusters were observed, all in the largest cities, RR 0.1 to 0.8 (Fig 2b). The land use / land cover analysis reveals notable distinctions between high- and low-risk clus- ters for the first 5 years of life. High-risk clusters are characterized by forest and agriculture, low-risk clusters are dominated by urban and open land.

**Conclusion:**
There is a clear geographical variation in the incidence of T1D in Sweden. First 5 years of life exhibited the strongest associa- tion with high- and low-risk clustering. Our findings facilitate further research into environmental factors potentially influencing T1D devel- opment. We hypothesize that the exposure of environmental factors, predominantly in rural areas and primarily during the first five years of life, elevates the risk for developing T1D.

**Background and aims:**
We have previously identified persistent dis- parities in glycaemic control and technology use (including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pumps) among people living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) across populations and age groups. How- ever, comparing metabolic control between countries has been chal- lenging due to differences in reported treatment targets and variations in data sources, whether clinical or national registries. Our aim is to present an updated comparison of metabolic control in adults living with T1D across five European countries, providing insights to sup- port strategies for improving diabetes management and minimizing variability between countries.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from 171 431 adults living with T1D (aged 18-79 years), covering the previous 12-24 months (data 2021-2023), sourced from population-based national registers and qual- ity improvement initiatives in five countries: Belgium (BE), Finland (FI), Norway (NO), Scotland (SC), and Sweden (SW). We compared distributions of ­HbA , systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, alongside the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), CGM, and statins across the countries. The relation between CSII use and HbA1c was assessed using Pearson correlation.

**Results:**
The study population varied from 22 283 to 50 476 between countries. The distribution of metabolic indicators and treatments is shown in Table 1. The proportion of patients with HbA1c ≤53 mmol/ mol (≤7%) varied between 43% (SW) and 18% (SC). The proportion with systolic blood pressure ≤140 mmHg varied between 86% (SW) and 57% (SC), whereas LDL cholesterol ≤2.5 mmol/L varied between 77% (BE) and 35% (SC). Countries with higher proportions of CSII users had higher proportions of people with ­HbA ≤53 mmol/mol (≤7%).

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights notable variations in metabolic con- trol, including blood pressure and blood lipid control, and the use of diabetes technology across five European countries, underscoring the need for tailored strategies to improve diabetes management. Countries with greater use of CSII showed better glycaemic control, suggest- ing that increased access to advanced diabetes technologies may help reduce disparities. However, further research is required. These find- ings emphasize the importance of aligning treatment goals and health- care strategies across nations to minimize variability in outcomes and optimize diabetes care for all people living with T1D.

**Background and aims:**
This study evaluated the population-level impact of implementing intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) on diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)-related hospi- talizations and associated healthcare costs in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) within a universal public health system.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective population- based cohort study in Andalusia, Spain, using administrative and clinical data from the Andalusian Public Health System. Adults with T1DM initiating publicly funded isCGM between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, were included. DKA hospitalizations were identified using ICD-10 codes and analyzed for the 12-month peri- ods before and after isCGM initiation. Costs were estimated based on standardized public tariffs for hospital and ICU stays.

**Results:**
Out of 18,682 eligible individuals, 13,616 were included in the final analysis (mean age: 43.7±13.5 years; 46.9% women). DKA hospitalization rates dropped significantly from 79.3 to 40.3 events per 10,000 person-years (rate ratio [RR]: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.40- 0.63], <0.001). The greatest absolute reduction occurred among individuals with baseline HbA1c ≥10%, with 136 fewer events per 10,000 person-years. Patients with ≥70% sensor usage showed lower post-intervention incidence (24.2 vs. 125.9 per 10,000 person-years), suggesting a dose-response effect. DKA hospitalizations were also more prevalent in women and younger adults prior to isCGM; both subgroups showed marked improvements post-implementation. Hos- pital costs decreased by over €780,000 during the study period. The most significant savings were observed in patients with high HbA1c and those with <5 years of diabetes duration. ICU-related expenditures dropped by €183,374. Regression models identified high HbA1c and younger age as major risk factors for DKA, while ≥70% sensor usage and longer diabetes duration were protective post-isCGM.

**Conclusion:**
Publicly funded isCGM implementation was associated with a substantial and clinically meaningful reduction in DKA hospi- talizations and related costs among adults with T1DM. The benefits were particularly significant in high-risk populations, including those with poor glycemic control and younger individuals. These findings underscore the importance of expanding access to CGM technologies as part of comprehensive diabetes management strategies in public health systems.

**Background and aims:**
Fractures are a burden to the persons sustain- ing them, and to society. Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) often have impaired bone health and a higher risk of falling, leading to an increased risk of fractures. Additionally, diabetes management and patient characteristics affecting bone health and fall risk have changed over time. Fracture incidence rates (IRs) have previously been reported in Danish persons with T1D and T2D in 1997-2017. The aim was to investigate changes over time in fracture IRs among persons with T1D, T2D, or persons without diabetes using an improved algorithm to identify types of diabetes and a longer study period.

**Materials and methods:**
We identified persons aged 18+ with a frac- ture in 1997-2021 in Denmark. The cohort was stratified into persons with T1D, T2D, and persons without diabetes. Annual fracture IRs per 10,000 person years (PY) with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated. Poisson regressions were estimated to test if the changes over time in fracture IRs were statistically significant.

**Results:**
We identified 1,478,808 persons with fracture(s) in 1997- 2021. The cohort consisted of 50.3% males with T1D, 42.3% males with T2D, and 46.1% males without diabetes. The median (IQR) age was 60 (44-73), 72 (62-81), and 54 (34-71) years in T1D, T2D, and persons without diabetes, respectively. The IR per 10,000 PY for all fractures and the IR for major osteoporotic fractures (MOF) were high- est among persons with T1D, and lowest for persons without diabetes for the entire study period. IRs for all fractures in T1D decreased over time from IR (CI): 521 (493-548) in the first to 470 (447-493) in the last year (p<0.001), and from 342 (330-355) to 333 (326-339) in T2D (p<0.001), while IRs slightly increased from 240 (238-241) to 250 (249-252) for all fractures in persons without diabetes (p<0.001). The same pattern showed for MOF in T1D and T2D, with a decrease from 217 (199-235) to 179 (164-193), in T1D (p<0.001), and from 188 (179- 198) to 148 (144-153) in T2D (p<0.001). On the contrary, fracture IRs slightly decreased from 95 (94-96) to 92 (91-93) for persons without diabetes (p<0.001) (Figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
Fracture IRs decreased for persons with T1D or T2D in Denmark from 1997 to 2021, but fracture IRs remained higher among the two populations with diabetes compared to persons without dia- betes. Therefore, it is important to gain further knowledge about the improvement of bone health and the prevention of falls and fractures in persons with T1D and T2D.

**Sex differences in risk for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality: a direct comparison of type 1 with type 2 diabetes patients in a nationwide register-based study**

V. Patsoukaki, ­Eriksson

1. Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, Sahlgrenska University Hos-

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide and individuals with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at greater risk compared to the general population. While previous research has extensively explored the impact of diabetes on CVD, no studies have directly compared CVD risk between T1D and T2D within each sex. This study aims to systematically compare CVD risk in T1D and T2D separately for men and women, identifying potential disparities in risk factors, disease progression, and clinical outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
Diabetes patients aged 18-84 years (yr) in the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR) with established T1D or T2D were included in a longitudinal cohort study from January 1, 2016, with five-year follow-up until December 31, 2020. We analysed time-to-first event for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF) as a primary diagnosis, stroke, cardiovascular (CV) mortality, and all- cause mortality using data from the National Patient Registry (NPR) and Cause of Death Registry (CoDR). Cox proportional hazard survival analysis, adjusted for age and diabetes type, was performed separately for males and females, with results as Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Age groups (<50, 50-59, 60-69, ≥70 yr) were stratified, and overall MI, HF, and stroke risk was analysed as all CVD.

**Results:**
A total of 404,026 diabetes patients were included (38,351 T1D; 365,675 T2D), with 233,858 males (56%) and 170,168 females (42%). Males with T2D under 50 yr had a significantly higher risk of all CVD (HR 1.51, 1.26-1.80), MI (HR 2.40, 1.78-3.26), and HF (HR 2.16, 1.40-3.35) than T1D males. In contrast, males over 70 yr had a lower MI risk (HR 0.74, 0.61-0.88), but no significant differences in other outcomes. Across ages, CV and all-cause mortality were lower in T2D males (HRs 0.84 and 0.90). Among females, those over 50 with T2D had lower CVD and mortality risks than T1D. In the 50-59 age group, HRs were 0.75 (0.64-0.79) for all CVD and 0.59 (0.46-0.74) for MI. Between 60-69 yr, HRs were 0.73 (0.64-0.83) and 0.53 (0.43- 0.64), respectively. Similar trends were observed for CV and all-cause mortality (HRs 0.62, 0.47-0.83 and 0.82, 0.68-1.00). Women with T2D had lower risks across all ages than those with T1D. After adjusting for established risk factors, female sex was protective in both diabetes types, with HRs of 0.78 (0.71-0.87) in T1D and 0.65 (0.64-0.66) in T2D.

**Conclusion:**
Younger males with T2D had higher CVD and mortal- ity risks than those with T1D. In contrast, females of all ages and T1D had significantly higher risk compared to T2D for almost all outcomes. A similar trend was found in men over 60 for MI. While female sex was generally protective, this was less pronounced in T1D. These findings highlight key sex differences in cardiovascular risk between diabetes types, fact that can guide clinical risk assessment and management.

**Background and aims:**
Improvements in blood lipid control, glu- cose management and cardiovascular treatment have reduced mac- rovascular morbidity and mortality in people living with type 1 dia- betes (T1D). This study examined whether mortality differs among people living with T1D in Belgium between 15 and 25 years post- diagnosis diagnosed between 1985 and 1998 (group A), compared to those diagnosed between 1998 and 2009 (group B).

**Materials and methods:**
Data were extracted from the Initiative for Quality Improvement and Epidemiology in Diabetes. Individu- als with a clinical diagnosis of T1D and diagnosed before the age of 30, who were 15 years post-diagnosis and had a known vital sta- tus, were selected. The total study population was divided into two study groups according to the calendar year of diabetes onset, with each group covering 10 read-out years. Group A included 345 indi- viduals diagnosed between 1985-1998 (read-out years 2001-2011); group B included 948 individuals diagnosed between 1998-2009 (read-out years 2012-2022). Both groups were followed until 25 years after diagnosis for their vital status. Kaplan-Meier methods assessed cumulative mortality. Cox regression determined associa- tions between patient characteristics at baseline and risk of mortality.

**Results:**
At 15 years post-diagnosis, mean HbA1c was higher in group A (67.4 vs. 64.8 mmol/mol (8.3 vs. 8.1 %), p < 0.05), while obesity was more common in group B (11.7% vs. 17.6% p < 0.05). Mean LDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure did not differ between the two groups. Antihypertensive therapy use was greater in group A (15.7% vs 11.3%, p < 0.01), while lipid-lowering therapy was more common in group B (10.4% vs. 15.2% p < 0.05). At 25 years post-diagnosis, the cumulative incidence of mortality was higher in group A (5.5% [95% CI 3.4-8.3] versus 2.1% [95% CI 1.2-3.5] p < 0.05). The association between patient characteristics at 15 years post-diagnosis and the mortality rate is shown in table 1.

**Conclusion:**
Survival rates were better for those diagnosed in a later era (1998-2009), independently of age at diabetes onset, sex, and other baseline patient characteristics. A higher ­HbA level 15 years post-diagnosis and higher age at diagnosis were positively correlated with an increased risk for mortality 25 years post-diagnosis.

The MiniMed 780G system has been available in the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) for over three years. In this real-world study, we aimed to show patterns of glycemic control and user versus system effort over that period.

**Materials and methods:**
’CareLink Personal’ data from January 2020 to January 2025 were extracted from MiniMed 780G system users, who self-reported to be 16 years old and above with type 1 diabetes, who were registered in EMEA and who provided consent. Users with ≥10 days of sensor glucose data before automation and users with ≥10 days of sensor glucose data in each of the 36 months after advanced hybrid closed loop (AHCL) initiation were included in analyses. Endpoints were based on glycemic control, system use and insulin delivery type and were aggregated per month. User burden is defined here as the percentage of insulin delivered by the user versus the system, while trust in the system is defined by advancement from conservative set- tings (glucose targets (GT) of 110 or 120 mg/dL; active insulin time (AIT) >2 hours) toward recommended optimal settings (ROS, GT=100 mg/dL; AIT=2 hours).

**Results:**
A total of 1,145 users were included. As shown in panel A, glycemic control, measured by average time spent in the 70-180mg/dL range, increased immediately to 78.6% and remained relatively stable over 36 months. Concurrently, as seen in panel B, the average percent- age of insulin delivery by autocorrection increased immediately from zero to 12.9% and continued to increase to 17.2% over three years. The average percentage of insulin delivered by the user decreased from 52.4% at baseline to 44.8% immediately and continued to decrease over time to 41.5%. At three years, the system was delivering most of the insulin automatically. Additionally, as illustrated in panel C, the percentage of time spent with an AIT of 2 hours increased from 26.3% to 56.5% and the percentage of time with GT of 100 mg/dL went from 40.1% to 57.9%.

**Conclusion:**
Glycemic control improved immediately following AHCL initiation and remained stable for at least three years. At the same time, user burden decreased immediately and further over time. The increase in users with ROS reflects growing trust in the sys- tem, while the increase in percentage of automated insulin delivery highlights the system’s adaptability. As we approach the era of fully closed-loop automated insulin delivery, trust in and reliance upon the system by the person with diabetes and the health care provider are critical for success.

**Background and aims:**
In the CLEAR Phase 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT), eight weeks of fully closed-loop (FCL) insulin delivery using the Cam APS HX, which does not require mealtime carbohydrate entry or bolusing, improved glycaemic outcomes compared to non- automated pump therapy with sensor in adolescents and young people with type 1 diabetes and HbA1c above recommended targets (≥ 7.5% [58mmol/mol]). This qualitative sub-study explored the impact of the fully closed-loop system on participants’ daily lives.

**Materials and methods:**
Twelve adolescents and young people (five female; age range 13-20 years) took part in virtual semi-structured interviews after completing the CLEAR Phase 2 RCT. Data was ana- lysed thematically using an inductive-deductive approach. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing diabetes distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes Teen [PAID-T]), hypoglycaemia fear (Hypoglycae- mia Fear Survey [HFS]), and closed-loop treatment satisfaction (INsu- lin Dosing Systems: Perceptions, Ideas, Reflections, and Expectations [INSPIRE]).

**Results:**
All participants reported reduced effort in managing diabetes, as they no longer needed to count carbohydrates or bolus, and worried less about glucose levels. This led to improved quality of life, with a greater sense of freedom and normalcy, particularly with meals. A few also noted benefits in physical activity, sleep, social life, mood and work life. Additionally, participants highlighted the usefulness of the ‘Boost’ feature, which intensifies insulin delivery, in maintaining glucose control. However, they expressed dissatisfaction with the algo- rithm’s slow response to postprandial glucose spikes, and the pump tubing (50% of those interviewed used the Omnipod patch pump dur- ing usual care). Questionnaire data showed no significant differences between periods in hypoglycaemia fear (FCL: 56 vs usual care: 60, p=0.22) or diabetes distress (FCL: 63 vs usual care: 72, p=0.12). Results of the INSPIRE questionnaire indicate participant satisfaction with the FCL system.

**Conclusion:**
In adolescents with type 1 diabetes, fully closed-loop insulin delivery reduced the daily burden of self-management, leading to improved quality of life. While limitations exist, the system shows promise in addressing the sub-optimal outcomes in this age group.

**Background and aims:**
Despite advances in technology, many people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) continue to use multiple daily injections (MDI), with glycemic outcomes remaining at suboptimal levels. This analysis evaluated outcomes in adults with T1D in a recent randomized controlled trial of the Omnipod® 5 Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) System compared with MDI and CGM use.

**Materials and methods:**
Adults aged 18-70 yrs with T1D ≥1 yr and screening HbA1c 7.5-11% (58-97 mmol/mol) currently using MDI with a FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM (study CGM) for ≥3 mon were enrolled across 8 institutions in France, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. Participants completed 14 days of data collection with MDI+CGM, then were ran- domized 2:1 to intervention (Omnipod 5 + CGM) or continued with MDI+CGM for 13 weeks (control). The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c at 13 weeks.

**Results:**
A total of 79 participants (median [range] age: 39 yrs [19- 67]; mean±SD BMI: 26.4±4.9 kg/m ; total daily insulin dose [TDI]: 0.69±0.24 U/kg/day) were randomized to intervention (n=52) or con- trol (n=27). After 13 weeks, HbA1c improvements were observed with AID compared with control: adjusted mean difference (95% CI) of -0.8% (-1.1, -0.6) [-9 mmol/mol (-12, -7)], p<0.0001 (Figure). Similarly, per- cent time in range (70-180 mg/dL [3.9-10.0 mmol/L]) was greater with AID: adjusted mean difference (95% CI) of 23.4% (18.8, 28.1), p<0.0001. Percent time <54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L) and <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) were low during the 13-wk trial period (median 0.18% and 1.99% with AID and 0.08% and 1.44% with control, respectively). There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis in either treat- ment group. There was no treatment group difference in the change from baseline to end of study in TDI or BMI (p>0.05).

**Conclusion:**
These results demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the Omnipod 5 System compared with MDI+CGM therapy and support the feasibility of direct transition from MDI to AID in adults with T1D not meeting glycemic targets.

**Background and aims:**
This study aimed to assess glycemic and patient-reported outcomes in adults with type 1 diabetes before and after initiation of the DBLG1 hybrid closed-loop system, integrated with the Accu-Chek Insight insulin pump and Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor.

**Materials and methods:**
In this prospective cohort study, adults with type 1 diabetes who started using the DBLG1 system between May 2022 and September 2023 were enrolled across 12 specialized diabetes centers in Belgium. Clinical and CGM data were collected at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months. The primary endpoint was the change in time in range (TIR; glucose 3.9-10.0 mmol/L) from start to 12 months. Baseline characteristics are presented as means ± SD, and outcomes as least squares means (95% CI).

**Results:**
167 patients were included, with a mean age of 44 ± 12 years, of whom 62% were female. The mean diabetes duration was 19 ± 13 years; 78% were prior insulin pump users and 95% prior CGM users. TIR increased from 57 (53, 60) % at baseline to 69 (66, 72) % at 12 months ( < 0.001). The proportion of patients achieving the consensus TIR target of more than 70% rose from 18% to 47% ( < 0.001). HbA1c decreased from 59.7 (57.5, 61.9) mmol/mol [7.6 (7.4, 7.8)%] to 53.0 (50.8, 55.2) mmol/mol [7.0 (6.8, 7.2)%] ( < 0.001), and time spent in hypoglycemia (<3.9 mmol/L) decreased from 3.7 (3.2, 4.2)% to 1.4 (1.1, 1.6)% ( < 0.001). Patient-reported outcomes showed significant improvement over the study period. Scores on the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey-II decreased from 24.9 (22.3, 27.5) to 19.4 (16.6, 22.2) for the worry subscale, and from 19.5 (18.4, 20.7) to 17.6 (16.3, 18.8) for the behavior subscale (both < 0.001). The Problem Areas in Diabetes- Short Form score improved from 8.0 (6.5, 9.5) to 6.9 (5.3, 8.4) ( = 0.001), and treatment satisfaction, as measured by the Diabetes Treat- ment Satisfaction Questionnaire, increased from 32.3 (31.1, 33.5) to 35.9 (34.5, 37.2) ( < 0.001, moderate effect sizes, Cohen’s ). The incidence of self-reported severe hypoglycemic events decreased mark- edly, from 28.5 (10.6, 76.1) to 1.7 (0.3, 9.7) events per 100 person- years ( = 0.004). The cumulative dropout rate was 9.6% at 12 months, with technology-related burden cited as the most common reason.

**Conclusion:**
This real-world study, including 93% of DBLG1 users in Belgium, indicates that use of the DBLG1 system over 12 months is associated with improved glycemic control, reduced hypoglyce- mia, enhanced diabetes-related quality of life, and increased treat- ment satisfaction.

**Background and aims:**
Real-world evidence alongside findings from RCTs is essential for assessing the long-term effectiveness and safety of hybrid closed-loop systems in the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D). This prospective observational study evaluated whether real- world changes in glycemic management and person-reported outcomes (PROs) persist 24 months after initiation of Control-IQ in adults with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
All adults with T1D who started Control-IQ between Oct 2021 and Dec 2022 were consecutively recruited at 13 Belgian centers. Data were prospectively collected from start to 24 months after start of Control-IQ, with 4-monthly evaluations during routine follow-up. PROs were measured through validated question- naires. Data are reported as mean ± SD or least-squares mean (95% CI).

**Results:**
Of the 473 adults included, 442 (93.4%) used Control-IQ for at least 24 months: 24 stopped using the system and 7 were lost to fol- low-up. People were on average 38.5 ± 13.1 years and predominantly female (57.3%), had T1D for 20.0 ± 12.6 years and 53.1% used an insu- lin pump before. Time in range (70-180 mg/dL) increased from start to 12 months (58.8% [56.8-60.9] to 71.0% [69.2-72.8], p<0.001) and remained stable up to 24 months (70.7% [68.8-72.5], p<0.001). Ben- efits in HbA1c, time in tight range (70-140 mg/dL), time in hypo- and hyperglycemia and CV were maintained up to 24 months (Figure 1A). Figure 1B shows sustained reductions in fear of hypoglycemia, diabetes distress, impact of diabetes on daily life, and improvements in treatment satisfaction. The number of self-reported severe hypoglycemic events was significantly lower in the first year (15.7 [9.5-25.9] per 100 person- years [PY]) and second year (15.0 [8.9-25.3] per 100 PY) compared to the 12-month period before start of Control-IQ (40.9 [22.6-74.3] per 100 PY). Work absenteeism declined significantly from 126 [48-333] days per 100 PY in the prior year to 73 [28-194] and 69 [18-264] days per 100 PY in the first and second year, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Improvements in glycemic management, diabetes-related quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and reductions in self-reported severe hypoglycemic events and work absenteeism were observed up to 24 months of Control-IQ use in a real-world population with T1D.

**Background and aims:**
Glycemic metrics based on continuous glu- cose monitoring (CGM) are emerging as potential novel predictors of chronic complications in people with diabetes. We aimed to evaluate the association between CGM profiles and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), defined by indices of heart rate variability (HRV), in adults with type 1 diabetes from the Diabetes Control and Complica- tions Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study, and to assess whether any observed associations are independent of HbA1c.

**Materials and methods:**
In 751 participants, a standard resting elec- trocardiogram (ECG) was obtained and blinded CGM performed (Libre Pro, Abbott, Inc) over the subsequent average of 11.9 days. CAN was defined by standard deviation of normally conducted R-R intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences between normal-to-normal R-R intervals (rMSSD) using previously validated cut-offs in this cohort from gold-standard cardiovascular reflex tests. CGM-derived metrics were compared between participants with vs. without ECG-derived CAN.

**Results:**
The median age of participants was 59 [Q1, Q3: 54, 63] years with diabetes duration of 36 [33, 41] years and HbA1c 7.6% [7.0, 8.5]. Sixty-three percent of participants had ECG-derived CAN (n=476). Those with vs. without ECG-derived CAN had significantly higher current HbA1c (7.9 vs. 7.6%), higher mean sensor glucose (172.3 vs. 162.0 mg/dl), and greater % time in hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL: 40.4 vs. 35.3%, >250 mg/dL: 16.8 vs. 13.9%), and significantly lower % time in target range (70-180 mg/dL: 51.1 vs. 54.2%) and lower % time in hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL: 3.9 vs. 5.0%, <70 mg/dL: 8.5 vs. 10.5%). In age-adjusted models, the significant associations between CGM metrics and ECG-derived CAN were fully attenuated by further adjustment for current HbA1c. Alternatively, in age-adjusted models, higher current HbA1c remained significantly associated with the pres- ence of ECG-derived CAN, independent of adjustment for each CGM metric (Figure).

**Conclusion:**
In adults with long-standing type 1 diabetes, short-term blinded CGM profiles were associated with ECG-derived CAN, but were not independent of HbA1c levels. These data suggest that longer- duration CGM profiles may be required to increase the predictive power of the risk of CAN.

**Background and aims:**
Cardiac autonomic nervous dysfunction (CAND) is a complication of type 2 diabetes and can also be preva- lent in individuals with prediabetes or advanced age. The proteome may provide insight into the poorly understood molecular mecha- nisms contributing to CAND. Therefore, we sought to investigate the association between circulating inflammatory and cardiovascu- lar proteomics biomarkers and selected heart rate variability (HRV) indices in a population-based cohort.

**Materials and methods:**
Using the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) cohort, 233 proteomics biomarkers were quantified in baseline plasma samples (KORA S4; 1999-2001) of 1389 individuals (64 years, 52% men) using proximity exten- sion assay technology. Five previously reported CAND-HRV indi- ces (Renyi entropy of the histogram with order (alpha) 4 (Renyi4), total power of the density spectra (TP), standard deviation of word sequence (SDWS), standard deviation of the short-term normal-to- normal interval variability (SDSA), and compression entropy (CE) were assessed at baseline in 982 individuals and in 407 individuals at baseline and at follow-up (KORA FF4; 2013-2014). Three multi- variable selection methods, partial least squares, random forest, and elastic net followed by linear and linear mixed-effects models with multiple testing correction were used to determine the association between the proteomic biomarkers measured at baseline and CAND- HRV indices cross-sectionally and over time.

**Results:**
Independent of several covariates, including age, anthro- pometry, and lifestyle factors, 10 proteins were associated with four CAND-HRV indices. C-C motif chemokine 23 (CCL23) was positively associated, while peptidoglycan recognition pro- tein (PGLYRP1) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) were negatively associated with Renyi4 cross-sectionally. Additionally, TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE) and growth/ differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) were negatively associated with CE cross-sectionally. Over time, interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha (IL6RA) positively associated with TP, whereas macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1) was negatively associated. Addi- tionally, myoglobin (MB) and agouti-related protein (AGRP) were positively and negatively associated with SDSA, respectively. Fur- thermore, gastrotropin (GT) and AGRP were positively and nega- tively associated with CE.

**Conclusion:**
This study identified 10 novel circulating proteins associated with CAND-HRV indices. These proteomic biomarkers could improve our understanding of the complex pathophysiology and poorly understood molecular mechanisms underlying CAND.

**Background and aims:**
To compare the cardiovascular, sympathoad- renal, and metabolic responses to physical exercise in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with or without cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN).

**Materials and methods:**
Data collected during a graded maximal exer- cise test (GXT) from 24 participants with T1D and CAN were com- pared against 24 matched control subjects without CAN. Throughout exercise, integrated cardiopulmonary variables were collected continu- ously spiroergometry. Plasma concentrations of adrenaline (AD), noradrenaline (NAD), glucose (PG) and lactate (PLa) were measured in 3-minutely intervals during exercise as well as at the peak workload. Data were assessed via independent t-tests and two-factor ANOVAs with significance accepted at p≤0.05.

**Results:**
Participants with CAN displayed a reduced V O (CAN: 19.6±5.4 vs NO CAN: 27.5±7.8 ml/kg/min) as well as reductions to several other cardiopulmonary, lactate and exercise performance variables during GXT. Peak catecholamine concentrations were lower in those with CAN compared to without (AD: 0.17±0.12 vs. 0.38±0.27 ng/mL, p=0.002. NAD: 1.86±1.04 vs. 2.85±1.23 ng/mL, p=0.007) as were the magnitudes of change in concentrations from rest to peak workloads (AD: Δ+0.13±0.12 vs. Δ+0.32±0.24 ng/mL, p=0.005. NAD: Δ+1.33±0.89 vs. Δ+2.33 ±1.30 ng/mL, p=0.005). PG concentrations throughout exercise were similar between groups and remained unchanged from rested values irrespective of CAN status.

**Conclusion:**
In adults with T1D, the presence of CAN does not influ- ence the plasma glucose response to graded exercise. However, cardio- pulmonary, exercise performance and sympathoadrenal responses are significantly affected. Our results support uncovering the presence of CAN when prescribing a personalised physical training plan.

2. Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, Department of Cardiology, West

**Background and aims:**
Among population with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM), diabetic autonomic neuropathy(DAN) may play a role in the development of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).However, there were few reports about the association of LVDD and different types of DAN other than diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN). We explored the association between different categories of DAN and LVDD in individuals with T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a cross-sectional study of 3440 participants with T2DM recruited in Diabetic Foot Care Center of West China Hospital, Sichuan University from January 2016 to February 2024. LVDD was assessed via echocardiography. 24-hour Holter ECG, postvoid residual volume (PVR) examinations, and gastric emptying scintigraphy were employed to evaluate cardiac autonomic dysfunc- tion, diabetic neurogenic bladder(DNB), and diabetic gastrointestinal autonomic neuropathy(DGAN), respectively. Logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) analyses were employed to examine the associations.

**Results:**
Severe cardiac autonomic dysfunction (SDNN < 50ms) and DNB were independently associated with LVDD, with odds ratios (OR)1.731 (95% CI: 1.103-2.719, = 0,018) and 1.356 (95% CI: 0.992-1.856, = 0.056) respectively, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. PSM analysis further validated the independent associations of SDNN <50ms (OR1.587, 95% CI 1.028, 2.450, = 0.037) and DNB (OR 1.454, 95% CI 1.011, 2.090, = 0.043). However, DGAN was not independently associated with LVDD. Additionally, women had a higher risk of LVDD compared to men(OR 1.995, 95% CI 1.379, 2.885, <0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Severe (SDNN<50 ms), rather than mild-moderate, car- diac autonomic dysfunction and diabetic neurogenic bladder are inde- pendently associated with LVDD in individuals with T2DM.Addition- ally, women have a higher risk of LVDD than men.

**Background and aims:**
Reduced clinical signs or symptoms of foot infection in individuals with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) render the DFU asymptomatic until later evidence of non-healing direction becomes evident. A polymicrobial nature of foot microbiome is con- sidered a potential key factor in the microbial bioburden of ulcers. The current antimicrobial standard of DFU care remains largely unchanged over the years. The aim of this study was to assess the proteomic pro- files of wound swabs from newly diagnosed DFUs, with the goal of identifying prognostic biomarkers for chronic wounds.

**Materials and methods:**
The prospective observational MicroPredict Study involved 112 people with diabetes and with DFU, during a six- month follow up period, seen at the foot clinic of a Diabetes Center. Enrolled participants were categorized according to healing time: rap- idly healing (RH, <40 days), slow-healing (SH, >40 days; <6 months) and chronic (CH, >6 months). Participant follow-up information was obtained from the electronic registers. Wound sampling was performed by routine debridement followed by brush grafting and metaproteome of the swabs were analysed using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spec- trometry (LCMS). Raw data output was searched against UniProtKB H. sapiens and multiple bacterial/fungal reference proteomes using Max Quant. Acquisition of identified peptide fragments was followed by data QC in Perseus, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis in G: profiler and pathways analysis on Reactome.

**Results:**
Metaproteomic analysis of DFU swabs identified persistently downregulated Neutrophil defensins by 6-fold, NETosis-associated Neutrophil elastase (ELANE) by 4-fold, antimicrobial Lactoferrin (LF) by 2.5-fold, as well as 2-fold diminished levels of survival-pro- moting sweat peptide dermcidin (DCD), in CH compared to the RH group. GO pathway analysis revealed considerable overrepresentation of GO:CC and GO:BP categories related to cell secretory granules compounds released as a defence mechanisms in response to micro- bial stimuli, in RH compared to CH wounds. Furthermore, out of 418 UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotated microbial proteins, 402 originated from the coliform genera Escherichia (232), Klebsiella (31), Serratia (22), and Citrobacter (91) and non-coliform bacteria genera Proteus (7) and Staphylococcus (5). Predominant fungal genera were Candida (10), while peptides originating from Alternaria (4), Trichophyton (1) and Fusarium (1) were less prevalent.

**Conclusion:**
Swab metaproteomes suggest substantial differences between RH and CH wounds, with host-defence responses decreased in CH. Moreover, the study identifies protein signature related to Coli- forms, Proteus and commensal species, evident to compromised host defenses, and skin flora potentially disrupted by antibiotic or immuno- suppressive therapy, observed in DFU. Our findings identify potential biomarkers of chronic wounds for a better, personalized approach, thus meriting further investigation.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are severe com- plications of diabetes, associated with high morbidity, mortality, and substantial socioeconomic costs. Once a DFU occurs, the risk of recur- rence is extremely high, primarily due to unmodifiable risk factors such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Therefore, patient education and adherence to optimal foot care practices are crucial for prevention. This study aimed to examine differences in foot care habits between individuals with and without a history of DFUs. Additionally, we assessed the impact of previous DFU on overall quality of life (QoL), anxiety, and depression.

**Materials and methods:**
An electronic survey was distributed in November 2022 to all individuals with diabetes in the Northern Denmark Region (n = 29,155). The survey collected data on demo- graphics, diabetes status, socioeconomic factors, and previous DFU history. It also included validated questionnaires: the Nottingham Assessment of Functional Footcare 29 (NAFF 29), Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

**Results:**
A total of 9,913 individuals responded, with 6,962 provid- ing complete data. Participants with and without a history of DFU had similar age (65 ± 12 years) and BMI (29.8 ± 6.0). However, those with previous DFU were more frequently male (68% vs. 60%, p < 0.001), had a longer diabetes duration (15 [8; 25] vs. 10 [5; 17] years, p < 0.001), and a higher prevalence of peripheral neuropathy (60% vs. 20%, p < 0.001). The overall prevalence of previous DFU in the study population was 7.1% (95% CI: 6.5-7.7%). Individuals with a history of DFUs exhibited significantly better overall foot care habits than those without (NAFF score: 54 vs. 50, p < 0.001), with notable improvements in 16 of 29 foot care categories (all p < 0.001). Seven additional categories showed maximum adherence in both groups. However, persistent deficits were noted in items related to footwear choices. Participants with a prior DFU reported signifi- cantly lower overall QoL scores (59 [40; 77] vs. 78 [57; 90], p < 0.001) and higher levels of anxiety (5 [2; 8] vs. 3 [1; 6], p < 0.001) and depression (3 [1; 7] vs. 2 [0; 4], p < 0.001) compared to those without previous DFUs.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings highlight the persistent burden of DFU on individuals. While foot care habits have improved, deficits in footwear choices suggest a need for targeted interventions. The lower QoL and increased anxiety and depression emphasize the psychological toll of DFU. Comprehensive care strategies, including mental health support, are essential to improving long-term outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains uncontrolled for many people despite treatment with multiple glucose-lowering med- ications. CATALYST Part 1 showed that endogenous hypercortisolism is present in 24% of these individuals. CATALYST Part 2 evaluated the efficacy and safety of mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antago- nist, in individuals with difficult-to-control T2D and hypercortisolism.

**Materials and methods:**
In this prospective, double-blind, phase 4 study, participants with T2D ­(HbA 7.5-11.5% on multiple glucose- lowering medications) and hypercortisolism (cortisol >1.8 μg/dL on 1-mg dexamethasone [DEX] suppression test with DEX ≥140 ng/dL) were randomized 2:1 to mifepristone 300-900 mg once daily (n=91) or placebo (n=45) for 24 weeks, stratified by the presence/absence of an adrenal imaging abnormality. The primary endpoint was the change in ­HbA . Secondary endpoints included changes in glucose-lowering medications, weight, waist circumference, and safety. Efficacy analyses were conducted in the intent-to-treat population.

**Results:**
Mean ­HbA at baseline was 8.6% and 8.4% in the mife- pristone and placebo groups, respectively. Mifepristone significantly decreased ­HbA from baseline to week 24 (least-squares mean [LSM] change, -1.47%) vs placebo (placebo-adjusted LSM difference, -1.32% [95% CI, -1.81 to -0.83]; <0.0001]), despite many participants in the mifepristone group reducing or discontinuing glucose-lowering medications. Mifepristone also significantly decreased body weight and waist circumference vs placebo (placebo-adjusted LSM difference, -5.1 kg [95% CI, -8.20 to -2.03] and -5.1 cm [95% CI, -8.23 to -1.99], respectively; both <0.01). Common (>10%) adverse events with mife- pristone were consistent with those previously described, including hypokalemia (30%; serious, 5.5%), fatigue, nausea, vomiting, head- ache, peripheral edema, diarrhea, and dizziness. No cases of adrenal insufficiency were reported.

**Conclusion:**
The CATALYST study demonstrated that treating hyper- cortisolism with cortisol-directed therapy, specifically mifepristone, significantly reduced ­HbA , body weight, and waist circumference in individuals with uncontrolled T2D despite multiple glucose-lowering therapies. This study supports the need to consider evaluating and addressing hypercortisolism in this patient population.

**Background and aims:**
HTD1801 is a gut liver anti-inflammatory metabolic modulator that activates AMPK and inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HTD1801 compared to placebo in patients with T2D inadequately controlled with metformin.

**Materials and methods:**
This Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 64 sites in China. Follow- ing a 4-week single-blind run-in period, eligible patients were rand- omized 2:1 to HTD1801 1000 mg BID (N=365) or placebo (N=184). Key entry criteria included T2D (WHO criteria), HbA1c 7.0%-10.5%, FPG ≤13.9 mmol/L, and stable use of metformin ≥8 weeks prior to screening. Metformin doses remained stable throughout blinded con- duct (≥1500 mg). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24.

**Results:**
Baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups, patients were generally ~55 years of age and ~50% male with glycemic and cardiometabolic parameters reflective of T2D. The pri- mary endpoint was achieved at Week 24, HTD1801 treated patients achieved an LS mean change in HbA1c of -1.21% compared to ‑0.68% with placebo (LS mean diff: -0.53, p<0.0001). 33% of HTD1801 treated patients achieved HbA1c <7% at Week 24 vs 11% with placebo (p<0.0001). Improvements in HbA1c with HTD1801 were paralleled with significant improvements in postprandial and FPG at Week 24. Significant reductions in lipids and inflammatory markers were also observed with HTD1801 treatment. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 75% vs 68% of patients while serious AEs occurred in 4% vs 6% with HTD1801 vs placebo, respectively. Five patients experienced an AE of hypoglycemia (1 moderate/4 mild in severity).

**Conclusion:**
Treatment with HTD1801 in patients with T2D and an inadequate response with metformin was safe and generally well tolerated. Furthermore, HTD1801 treatment resulted in significant improvements in glycemic control and key cardiometabolic param- eters demonstrating comprehensive benefits in this complex meta- bolic disease.

**Amycretin, a novel, unimolecular glucagon-like peptide-1 and**

**Background and aims:**
To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effects on body weight of single- (SAD) and multiple-ascending doses (MAD) of s. c. amycretin in people with overweight or obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
In this single-centre, double-blind study adults with BMI 27.0-39.9 kg/m and ­HbA <6.5% were randomised to receive s. c. amycretin (n=101) or placebo (n=24). The study had five parts: Part A (SAD): three treatment arms (0.3, 0.6 or 1 mg); Part B (MAD - dose escalation): once-weekly (OW) amycretin escalated every 4 weeks (Q4W) from 0.3 mg to 60 mg for a total of 36 weeks; and Parts C, D and E (MAD - dose response): OW amycretin escalated Q4W from 0.3 mg up to a maintenance dose (for 12 weeks) of 20, 5 or 1.25 mg, for a total treatment duration of 36, 28 and 20 weeks, respectively. Primary endpoint: number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary endpoints: AUC, the maximum plasma concentration of amycretin ­(C ) and relative change in body weight from baseline for Parts B-E.

**Results:**
Amycretin was considered safe and tolerated up to 60 mg with current dose escalation. The most common TEAEs were gas- trointestinal, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, and most were mild to moderate in severity. Increases in AUC and ­C with increasing dose levels of amycretin were consistent with dose pro- portionality. Mean baseline BMI was 30.0-33.1 kg/m across Parts B-E. Using a mixed model for repeated measures, the estimated mean body weight percentage change from baseline was significantly (p<0.001) higher with amycretin versus placebo in Part B (60 mg, −24.3% vs −1.1%, respectively; week 36), Part C (20 mg, −22.0% vs 1.9%, respectively; week 36), Part D (5 mg, −16.2% vs 2.3%, respec- tively; week 28) and Part E (1.25 mg, −9.7% vs 2.0%, respectively; week 20) (Figure).

**Conclusion:**
In people with overweight or obesity, OW s. c. amy- cretin up to 60 mg demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile consistent with glucagon-like peptide-1 and amylin agonists, and led to significant, dose-dependent body weight reductions.

**Background and aims:**
HRS9531, a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor ago- nist (RA), has demonstrated substantial potential for glycemic control and weight loss. This phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of HRS9531 in Chinese overweight or obese adults without diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-con- trolled phase 2 study enrolled Chinese adults with a BMI of 28.0-40.0 kg/m², or a BMI of 24.0-28.0 kg/m² with at least one weight-related comorbidity. Participants were randomized to receive once-weekly sub- cutaneous injections of the target dose of HRS9531 8.0 mg (via titra- tion) or placebo for 36 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in body weight (BW) from baseline to week 36.

**Results:**
A total of 61 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive either HRS9531 8.0 mg (n=49) or placebo (n=12). Baseline characteris- tics were generally comparable between the two groups. The mean base- line BW was 84.6 kg, and the mean baseline BMI was 31.3 kg/m². At week 36, the least-squares mean difference in percentage change in BW from baseline, compared with placebo, was -21.1% (95% CI, -25.6% to -16.6%; P<0.0001) for the HRS9531 8.0 mg group. The proportions of participants achieving ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, and ≥25% BW reduc- tion in the HRS9531 8.0 mg group were 93.9%, 91.8%, 87.8%, 59.2%, and 30.6%, respectively, compared to 16.7%, 8.3%, 0%, 0%, and 0% in the placebo group. Additionally, HRS9531 improved waist circumference, BMI, systolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insu- lin, ­HbA levels, and reduced triglyceride levels at week 36 compared to placebo. The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild in severity and gastrointestinal-related, with the most com- mon being diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. No participants permanently discontinued treatment due to TEAEs.

**Conclusion:**
In overweight or obese adults without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous HRS9531 significantly reduced body weight at week 36 compared to placebo and demonstrated a manageable safety profile, pri- marily involving gastrointestinal disorders.

**Background and aims:**
Low muscle mass predicts poor health out- comes (e.g. frailty, disability, reduced immunity, increased infection risk, longer hospital stays, shorter lifespan etc) necessitating new mus- cle-sparing strategies. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are proven weight loss options for obesity, type 2 diabetes and related conditions. However, clinical concern is rapidly growing over the extent skeletal muscle (SkM) loss has in contributing to this effect. The impact of GLP- 1RA on SkM remains poorly understood. Clinical trials such as STEP1, STEP4, and SUSTAIN8 with semaglutide showed lean mass accounted for 40% of weight loss, with similar results observed with liraglutide (SCALE), tirzepatide (SURMOUNT-1), and dulaglutide (AWARD-11). As mitochondrial dysfunction drives obesogenic and atrophic defects, we developed mitochondria-targeted molecules to prevent and/or reverse these detrimental skeleto-metabolic changes. After extensive empirical optimisation, we identified Myo4 as a lead molecule, and herein report the muscle preserving and anti-obesogenic efficacy of this lead in a murine diet-induced obesity (DIO) model.

**Materials and methods:**
DIO was induced in male C57BL/6JRj mice fed high fat diet (60% kcal; D12492) or standard chow (Altromin 13240) from 5 weeks for 16 weeks, then dosed (s.c., q.d., T.I.W.) with Myo4 (0.22-2.2 mg/kg), semaglutide (10 nmol/kg), or both drugs for 4 weeks (n=8-12 per group). Body weight, food intake, fasting glucose, insulin, OGTT, eWAT, BAT, SkM weight, and fat:lean redistribution (MRI) were assessed. Blood and SkM (e.g. gastrocnemius) levels of Myo4 and its unique metabolite confirming SkM utilisation were determined within 1 h of dosing (0.1-5 mg/kg, i.p., q.d.) by LC-MS. Mitochondria-specific accumulation was confirmed using super-resolution microscopy with LC-MS/MS.

**Results:**
Myo4 rapidly accumulated within the mitochondrial matrix confirming organelle-specific delivery (i.e. 90 %, ≤ 60 min) with clean and toxicological assessments, and ­EC < 20nM across screening assays. In DIO mice, semaglutide caused an expected significant decrease in initial food intake (0-11 days) but this effect was absent with Myo4 treatment alone at all doses. Figure 1 summarises Key Outcomes: Semaglutide and Myo4 alone reduced weight and fat mass, and glucose (OGTT) but only Myo4 alone increased lean mass. Crucially, Myo4 enhanced the beneficial metabolic effects of sema- glutide, and significantly improved body composition (fat:lean ratio; Fig. 1).

**Conclusion:**
Myo4 is a novel anti-obesogenic and muscle-preserving therapeutic, usable as monotherapy for obesity requiring weight loss with muscle preservation, or in combination with GLP-1RA to prevent loss of SkM mass/function.

**Icovamenib and semaglutide combination therapy enhances body weight loss and glycaemic control while preserving lean mass in a type 2 diabetes animal model**

P. Somanath

**Background and aims:**
Icovamenib (BMF-219) is an oral, covalent menin inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of T1D and T2D. Menin is a key negative regulator of beta cell mass and GLP-1 receptor expres- sion. Icovamenib induced durable glycemic control and controlled beta cell proliferation in animal and human islet models. Icovamenib enhanced responsiveness of human islets to GLP-1 receptor agonists while increas- ing GLP-1 receptor expression and insulin content. Here we assessed the effects of icovamenib in combination with semaglutide in diabetic rats.

**Materials and methods:**
Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were treated with icovamenib (200mg/kg, QD) or vehicle for 14 days followed by 14 days with low dose semaglutide (0.02mg/kg, QD). The effects of com- bination therapy vs. single agent semaglutide on glycemic parameters, body weight and body composition were measured.

**Results:**
Combination treated ZDF rats displayed significant reductions in fasting and fed blood glucose (BG) levels as early as one week, with 60% reduction in fasting BG at two weeks vs. semaglutide alone. Com- bination therapy for two weeks substantially improved OGTT (50% AUC reduction of blood glucose) and HbA1c (>1% reduction) vs. semaglutide. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) declined 75% in the com- bination therapy arm vs. semaglutide. HOMA-B and c-peptide index were notably improved after one week of combination therapy, indi- cating enhanced beta cell function. Importantly, combination therapy enhanced body weight reduction vs. semaglutide, exclusively by fat loss with complete preservation of the lean mass fraction (>+10% change from baseline, p<0.01). Results from additional mechanistic studies probing into icovamenib mechanism of action will also be presented.

**Conclusion:**
Icovamenib enhanced the effects of semaglutide in ZDF rats, demonstrating improved glycemic control, enhanced weight loss and complete preservation of lean mass. Assessment of this novel combination in persons with T2D and obesity is warranted, as it may provide greater glycemic and weight loss effects.

2. UK, Exeter Genomics Laboratory, Exeter, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) has mainly been studied in clinically referred cohorts, which may have overestimated the severity of disease compared to popula- tion cohorts. We investigated the prevalence, contribution to overall diabetes, penetrance and all-cause mortality in the largest population sample to date (n = 454,275).

**Materials and methods:**
We identified pathogenic variants in 10 known MODY genes from exome sequencing from 454,275 UK Biobank participants (mean age: 57yrs). We analysed the prevalence, age-dependent penetrance of diabetes, and all-cause mortality over a mean follow-up period of 13.4 years.

**Results:**
1 in 1,052 individuals (0.095%) carried a pathogenic MODY variant. The prevalence increased to 0.63% in individuals with diabetes and further increased to 2.13% in those diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 30yrs. was the most common aetiology (37.7%, n = 163/432) followed by (22%, n = 95/432), and (22%, n = 57/432). In clinical settings, variants in low penetrance genes make up only a small portion (<2%) of all identified cases in the UK but make up 31% of individuals identified in the population. variants were highly penetrant (average HbA1c 8.8 mmol/mol higher and 94.5% with prediabetes/diabetes) but showed no impact on all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94, 95%CI: 0.6-1.48, = 0.79). In contrast, non- MODY variants exhibited lower penetrance, with only 12% (95%CI: 8-15.9%) of developing diabetes by age 40yrs and 31.6% (95%CI: 25-37.7%) by 60yrs. Penetrance of these variants varied by genetic aetiology ( : 12%, : 32.9%, : 60.6% developing diabetes by 60yrs). Cox proportional hazard model showed that parental diabetes history (HR: 2.54, 95%CI: 1.55-4.14, = 1.8x10 ), and T2D polygenic score (HR: 1.52, 95%CI: 1.14-2.03, = 0.004) increased the penetrance of non- MODY genes. All non- MODY genes did not show an increased all-cause mortality (HR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.53-1.23, = 0.32).

**Conclusion:**
Our genotype-first approach demonstrates that MODY is relatively prevalent and exhibit variable penetrance with low pen- etrance genes appearing more common in the population. These finding provide valuable information that would be essential for screening stud- ies. The absence of excess mortality in -MODY supports current practice of discharging these patients from follow-up.

2. Exeter, UK, Exeter Genomics Laboratory, Royal Devon University

**Background and aims:**
is a highly penetrant monogenic disorder but unexplained variability exists in glycaemic levels (HbA1c range: 5.8-7.6%). Given the known role of polygenic background in MODY, we investigated whether polygenic risk influences the MODY phenotype and its clinical consequences.

**Materials and methods:**
To assess the effect of polygenic back- ground on -MODY, we constructed polygenic risk scores (PGS) for Type 2 diabetes (T2D), HbA1c, Fasting Glucose and six other diabetes related traits. We examined 901 European -MODY patients (mean age: 32.2, HbA1c: 6.4%), compared against 7,645 ancestry matched controls to test for enrichment in polygenic back- ground. We replicated our findings in the UK Biobank, a non-clini- cally ascertained population cohort, where we identified 158 Euro- pean carriers (mean age: 56.6, HbA1c: 6.4%). Unadjusted and Adjusted regression linear and logistic models were used to assess the effect of polygenic background on HbA1c, Treatment and Dia- betes Diagnosis in -MODY.

**Results:**
The effect of the polygenic background was demonstrated by an increase in Fasting Glucose, HbA1c, and T2D polygenic risk in -MODY patients, compared to controls without diabetes (dif- ference 0.15-0.33, all p <9.5x10 ). However, only the HbA1c PGS significantly modified the -MODY phenotype, with each standard deviation increase associated with a 0.083% (0.05-0.12%, p<1.3x10 ) increase in Hba1c measurement in -MODY. This was primarily driven by non-glycaemic HbA1c pathways (0.06%) versus glycaemic pathways (0.03%). We also saw the effect of polygenic background in 158 non-clinically referred carriers. A one standard devia- tion increase in the HbA1c PGS was associated with a 0.097% (0.017- 0.18%, p = 0.016) increase in HbA1c measurement in -MODY. HbA1c ranged from 6.13% in the first percentile to 6.63% in the ­99 . Non carriers did not phenocopy with those in the ­99 percentile having a HbA1c of 5.58%. carriers with a higher HbA1c PGS were more likely to receive unnecessary treatment and be incidentally diagnosed with diabetes. Only 10.5% of individuals in the bottom quan- tile of the HbA1c PGS received treatment, compared to 26.9% (p = 0.002) in the top quantile. Similarly, 44.7% of individuals in the bottom quantile were clinically diagnosed with diabetes, compared to 56.1% (p = 0.01) in the top quantile.

**Conclusion:**
Polygenic background plays a substantial role in MODY, altering HbA1c levels and increasing the risk of unnecessary treatment and incidental diabetes diagnosis. This study provides a clear example of how polygenic background can modify the clinical expres- sion of a highly penetrant monogenic disorder.

**Background and aims:**
A type 1 diabetes (T1D) genetic risk score (GRS) can help identify antibody-negative, C-peptide-positive, T1D patients who might otherwise go undetected. A T1DGRS also offers good discrimination against Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). We assessed the clinical utility of routine measurement of T1DGRS in a large cohort of insulin-treated cases referred for MODY genetic testing.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed 1,229 insulin-treated Europe- ans referred for MODY testing to the Exeter Genomics Laboratory. T1D was excluded using biomarkers when available. All cases had a targeted next generation sequencing gene panel for MODY and a 10 SNP T1DGRS. We derived T1D population centiles using gold- standard T1D controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Con- sortium (n=1,963).

**Results:**
Before MODY genetic testing, based on the T1DGRS distri- bution, we estimated that 21% (95%CI:18-24) of the clinically referred suspected MODY cases had T1D. The cases with a T1DGRS below the 20th centile of the T1D population were more likely to have a mono- genic aetiology compared to those with a T1DGRS greater than the 80th centile (24% vs. 6%, p=0.01). Limiting MODY genetic testing to cases with T1DGRS <80th centile would reduce testing by 4.2%, whilst miss- ing 1.3% of monogenic diagnoses. After MODY genetic testing, using T1DGRS cut-offs that identify T1D with >80% probability, we identified 102/901(11.3%) of cases with suspected T1D in patients without a known monogenic cause for their diabetes. Suspected T1D patients were diag- nosed younger (10.5y vs. 22y), had lower BMI (23kg/m2 vs. 27kg/m2), lower C-peptide (403pmol/l vs. 704pmol/l) and lower parental history of diabetes (46% vs. 64%), supporting a diagnosis of T1D.

**Conclusion:**
Using a T1DGRS before genetic testing in MODY referrals can reduce expensive MODY genetic testing but misses some monogenic cases. A T1DGRS is valuable after MODY genetic testing to identify atypical T1D among unsolved MODY cases, highlighting its immense potential for integration into the current standard of testing.

**Background and aims:**
MODY caused by pathogenic variants in is a common form of monogenic diabetes. Sulfonylurea (SU) is considered first-line treatment of HNF1A-MODY (MODY3), but SU is associated with hypoglycaemia and body weight gain. encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the kidney why the glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in HNF1A-MODY has been questioned. Here, we assessed the glucose-lowering effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflo- zin in individuals with HNF1A-MODY.

**Materials and methods:**
The MOD3ST-TRIAL was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial randomising adults with HNF1A-MODY treated with at least one glucose-lowering drug and HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol to empagliflozin 25 mg for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week washout period and then placebo for 4 weeks or the opposite sequence. The primary outcome was mean glucose assessed by continu- ous glucose monitoring (CGM) during 10 days and was evaluated in participants who tolerated and adhered to both interventions.

**Results:**
Nineteen individuals were randomised (placebo first: n = 10). One participant discontinued the study after two weeks of placebo. Eighteen participants completed the study and were included in the efficacy analyses (baseline: 8 men [44%], median age 48 years [IQR 39-55], median eGFR 110 [95-116] ml/min/1.73 ­m , median HbA1c 58 [53-68] mmol/mol, mean CGM glucose 10.4 [SD 2.5] mmol/l, mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 8.1 [2.2] mmol/l). Compared with pla- cebo, empagliflozin lowered mean glucose (-2.3 mmol/l, 95% CI -3.3 to -1.3, <0.001, Figure 1A) and FPG (-2.1 mmol/l, 95% CI -3.2 to -1.1, <0.001) and increased time in range (Figure 1B, <0.001). There were no significant differences between interventions in hypoglycaemic outcomes. Adverse events were generally mild and transient. No severe adverse events were attributable to empagliflozin.

**Conclusion:**
Four-week empagliflozin treatment added to existing glu- cose-lowering medicine in individuals with HNF1A-MODY improved glycaemia compared with placebo without significantly increasing risk of hypoglycaemia or severe adverse effects.

**Background and aims:**
Understanding the genetic causes of rare diseases affecting pancreatic β cells provides insight into essential pathways for their development and function. Mutations in genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or in ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking cause monogenic diabetes, microcephaly and epi- lepsy. Following the discovery of recessive mutations as a novel cause of neonatal diabetes in 6 patients, we studied the effect of the V59E mutation in β cells.

**Materials and methods:**
expression in human fetal pancreas from gestational week 7 to 12 was studied by microarray of FACS-sorted epithelial and mesenchymal populations. We inserted by CRISPR-Cas9 the V59E mutation in healthy human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then differentiated these into β cell aggregates. β cell development was evaluated by immu- nocytochemistry and single cell (sc) RNA-seq. β cell function was evaluated by dynamic insulin secretion (by perifusion) and by human C-peptide levels during an intraperitoneal glucose toler- ance test 4 months post-engraftment of iPSC-β cells under the kidney capsule of immunodeficient ­Rag2 mice. β cell apoptosis was assessed by Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide staining, and ER stress mark- ers by qPCR.

**Results:**
was ubiquitously expressed in mesenchymal, acinar, ductal/endocrine progenitors and endocrine cells in the devel- oping human pancreas. To study the impact of one of the mutations identified in individuals with neonatal diabetes, iPSCs were edited to insert the homozygous V59E mutation. At the end of the β cell differentiation, the proportion of β cells was similar in healthy and mutant aggregates. scRNA-seq revealed separate clustering of control and mutant β cells. Mutant iPSC-β cells displayed downregu- lation of , an ER stress transducer and protein trafficking regulator, and an inhibited ER-to-Golgi trafficking gene signature. Transcription factors and , key for β cell development and function, were downregulated, as were the insulin processing genes , and and genes pertaining to insulin secre- tion/exocytosis. Mutant iPSC-β cells had a halved insulin content and reduced insulin secretion when stimulated by glucose, glucose plus the GLP-1 analogue exenatide and KCl. Upon exposure to ER stressors, mutant β cells underwent more apoptosis and upregulated ER stress markers. After 4 months of maturation of iPSC-β cell aggre- gates transplanted into mice, human C-peptide was barely detectable in mice transplanted with mutant iPSC-β cells, while it was present in mice transplanted with healthy iPSC-β cells.

**Conclusion:**
We modelled newly discovered neo- natal diabetes using human iPSC-derived β cells carrying the V59E patient mutation. The mutant iPSC-β cells showed inhibited ER-to-Golgi trafficking and insulin secretion gene signatures. The mutation induced a marked insulin secre- tory defect and increased β cell sensitivity to ER stress. This disease highlights the crucial role of ER-to-Golgi trafficking and the ER stress response in β cells.

**Background and aims:**
The onset of diabetes in infancy, coupled with immune dysregulatory features, strongly suggests a monogenic form of autoimmune diabetes. Uncovering new monogenic autoimmune diabetes genes provides fundamental insights into pathways involved in immune regulation and heterogeneous type 1 diabetes (T1D). We sought to identify new genetic causes of monogenic autoimmune dia- betes through genome sequencing and overlaid multi-omics data to uncover disease mechanisms.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed genome sequencing in two consanguineous individuals with diabetes (diagnosed at 17w and 36w) and agammaglobulinemia to look for recessive causes of mono- genic autoimmune diabetes. Replication studies were performed using genome or Sanger sequencing in affected family members and 220 individuals with either isolated infancy-onset diabetes (<1y) or early- onset diabetes (<3y) and additional features. Antibody testing was per- formed by automated ELISA assay and clinical features were collected via a dedicated referral form. We analysed RNA, DNA methylation and immune cells to characterise the phenotype and gain insights into mechanism.

**Results:**
Both probands were homozygous for variants in the novel disease gene is a non-coding RNA subu- nit of the minor spliceosome complex which is essential for splicing specific introns present in 0.5% of human genes. To replicate this find- ing and investigate the role of the minor spliceosome in autoimmune diabetes, we screened our replication cohort for biallelic variants in all 70 genes encoding minor spliceosome components. We identified a further 5 individuals with variants and 12 with bial- lelic variants. In total, we identified 19 cases with genetic defects in the minor spliceosome and infancy/early-onset diabetes. The median age at onset of diabetes across all cases was 17w (range 2-260w). Additional immune dysregulatory features were present in 12/19 (63%) individuals and, where antibody testing was possible, 5/11 (45%) were GADA positive demonstrating an autoimmune diabetes aetiology. RNA sequencing of 6 individuals’ whole blood identified a profound defect in minor intron splicing, confirming that the vari- ants are pathogenic, and a severe defect in B cell development and innate immunity pathways. This was further supported by deconvolu- tion analysis of whole blood DNA methylation data (n=17) showing significantly reduced naïve B cells, and confirmatory fresh flow whole blood cytometry highlighting a profound B cell developmental defect (n=1). Methylation score analysis showed cases were between healthy controls and T1D, similar to other known monogenic autoimmune dia- betes cases, further supporting an autoimmune mechanism underlying these individuals’ diabetes.

**Conclusion:**
Biallelic pathogenic variants in the minor spliceosome components and are novel genetic causes of monogenic autoimmune diabetes and the first examples of non-coding causes of the disease. These variants result in profound immune dys- regulation, particularly in B cell differentiation. These findings high- light a critical role for the minor spliceosome, and the 0.5% of genes it acts upon, on the regulation of the immune system and supports a role for B cells in type 1 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Semaglutide and cagrilintide monotherapies have been shown to induce weight loss. We assessed the combination of semaglutide 2.4 mg and cagrilintide 2.4 mg (CagriSema) for weight management in adults with T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
REDEFINE 2 was a phase 3a, double- blind, placebo‑controlled, multicentre trial in adults with BMI ≥27 kg/m , T2D and ­HbA 7-10%, treated with lifestyle intervention or 1-3 oral antidiabetes drugs. Participants (pts) were randomised 3:1 to once-weekly s.c. CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg or placebo (pbo), with lifestyle intervention, for 68 weeks. Co-primary endpoints were body weight (BW) change (%) and proportion of pts with ≥5% BW reduction. Other endpoints included: proportion of pts with ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥20% BW reduction, and ­HbA ≤6.5%; change in ­HbA ; time in glucose range (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) in a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) subgroup. Safety and tolerability were assessed. Data are for the trial product estimand unless otherwise specified.

**Results:**
904 pts were randomised to CagriSema and 302 to pbo; 52.8% were male, mean age 56 years, BW 102.2 kg, BMI 36.2 kg/ m , ­HbA 8.0%, and T2D duration 8.5 years. 26.9% were receiv- ing sulphonylureas. BW reductions were significantly greater with CagriSema (−15.7%) vs pbo (−3.1%) at week 68 (estimated treat- ment difference [ETD] [95% CI]: −12.6 [−13.4, −11.7]; p<0.0001) (Fig A). For the treatment policy estimand, BW reductions were −13.7% and −3.4%, respectively (ETD [95% CI]: −10.4 [−11.2, −9.5]; p<0.0001). Pts receiving CagriSema vs pbo had greater achievement of BW reductions of ≥5% (89.7% vs 30.2% of pts), ≥10% (74.1% vs 9.1%), ≥15% (51.6% vs 1.5%) and ≥20% (29.2% vs 0.2%), and ­HbA ≤6.5% (80.7% vs 12.2%) (all p<0.0001), and had greater reduction in ­HbA (−2.0%-points vs −0.1%-points; ETD [95% CI]: −2.0 [−2.2, −1.8]; p<0.0001); (Fig B). In the CGM subgroup (n=199), time in range was 89.1% vs 46.1% for CagriSema vs pbo recipients, respectively (change from baseline 46.0%-points vs 3.0%-points; ETD [95% CI]: 43.0 [30.8, 55.1]; p<0.0001). Gas- trointestinal AEs were reported by 72.5% and 34.4% of pts with CagriSema and pbo, respectively; most were transient and mild to moderate in severity. Level 2 hypoglycaemic episodes were reported by 6.0% and 3.3%, and level 3 episodes by 0.2% and 0% of pts in the CagriSema and pbo groups, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
CagriSema provided clinically meaningful weight reduc- tion and improvements in metabolic health in adults with BMI ≥27 kg/m and T2D, with tolerability comparable to other incretin-based therapies.

**Background and aims:**
Overweight and obesity are prevalent in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and contribute to cardiovascular risk. Tirzepatide (TZP) is a dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon- like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, developed for use in type 2 diabetes and for obesity. TZP has not been previously studied in T1D in a controlled setting.

**Materials and methods:**
Adults with T1D (duration > 2 years, age 18-60 years, BMI > 30kg/m ) were randomised 1:1 to receive weekly subcutaneous TZP (2.5mg for 4 weeks, 5.0mg thereafter or maximum tolerated dose) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in body weight over the trial period. Secondary outcomes included change in insulin dose, HbA1c, diet features and body composition.

**Results:**
Of 24 adults with T1D (mean±SD; 41±10 years, BMI 33.7±3.2 kg/m , HbA1c 7.3±1.2%, total daily dose of insulin median 69.1 units/day [interquartile range 41.9 to 86.7 units/day], 42% female, 13 insulin pump, 11 multiple daily injection), 22 participants com- pleted the study. After 12 weeks, TZP was associated with significant reductions in body weight vs placebo (mean difference -8.7 kg [8.8% reduction], 95% confidence interval [CI] -12.0 to -5.5 kg; p<0.0001). Of the weight lost, 82% was fat mass (mean difference -7.2 kg [95% CI -10.5 to -3.9 kg] vs placebo; p=0.0002). In contrast, the mean differ- ence in fat-free mass was -1.8 kg [95% CI -3.75 to +0.1 kg] vs placebo; p=0.06). TZP was associated with reductions in HbA1c (mean differ- ence -0.35% [95% CI -0.7 to 0.0%] vs placebo; p=0.05) and total daily insulin dose (geometric mean -24.2 units/day TZP and -0.3 units/day placebo [insulin dose -35.1% from baseline vs placebo, 95% CI -46.5 to -21.3%; p=0.0002). Amongst pump users, insulin dose reductions were observed early (-22% from baseline insulin dose at 2 weeks vs placebo; p=0.07, and -42% from baseline at 6 weeks vs placebo; p=0.007). Overall energy intake was reduced (mean difference -429 kcal/d [95% CI -852 to -5 kcal/d] vs placebo; p=0.05) and self-reported physi- cal activity level (International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form) did not change. Two study participants dropped out (TZP n=1 due to increased anxiety coinciding with difficulties attending study visits, placebo n=1 due to loss of interest in the study). There were no episodes of DKA or severe hypoglycaemia in either group.

**Conclusion:**
In the first randomised trial of TZP in T1D, TZP was associated with favourable changes in weight and in body composition (i.e. loss of fat mass with relative preservation of fat-free mass) and marked insulin dose reductions. Future studies are required to assess efficacy and safety in a phase 3 setting and to understand the mecha- nisms of the rapid TZP-driven metabolic impacts specific to T1D.

5. mark, Novo Nordisk A/S, Soeborg, Denmark, UT Southwestern

**Background and aims:**
People treated with dialysis are at high-risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Semaglutide reduces major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and those without T2D who are living with obesity and high cardiovascular risk. Limited data are available to establish the safety and efficacy of semaglutide in people receiving dialysis. In this patient- level pooled analysis, we aimed to assess the safety of semaglutide in people who initiated dialysis.

**Materials and methods:**
Using data from four randomized placebo- controlled cardiovascular or kidney outcomes trials (SUSTAIN-6, SELECT, FLOW, and SOUL), we compared adverse events (AEs) that were systematically collected in all four trials (serious AEs, AEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation, and MACE) in participants originally randomized to semaglutide or placebo at trial start and who initiated dialysis during follow-up. A diagnosis of T2D was required in all trials except for SELECT. We evaluated participants who initiated dialysis (in-trial analysis) and a sub-population of participants who remained on treatment following dialysis start (on-treatment analysis). Dialysis events were adjudicated.

**Results:**
Of 34,064 participants, 307 (0.9%) initiated dialysis (semaglu- tide: N=141, placebo: N=166). Participant characteristics were similar between groups at dialysis start (average age: 64.4 vs 65.1 years, male sex: 74% vs 73%, for semaglutide vs placebo, respectively), but more participants in the placebo group were treated with insulin (semaglu- tide: 19.9%, placebo: 25.3%). Mean duration of follow-up (defined as the day after dialysis start and until study end) was 1.15 years in both groups during the in-trial analysis. Of those who initiated dialysis, 71 and 94 participants in the semaglutide and placebo groups continued treatment, respectively. The proportion of participants experiencing SAEs and their event rates were similar for semaglutide treated par- ticipants for the in-trial and the on-treatment analyses (see Table). All- cause mortality and MACE was numerically lower for both proportions and event rates in participants treated with semaglutide compared to placebo.

**Conclusion:**
In this pooled analysis, treatment with semaglutide was not associated with a higher proportion of SAEs, including for MACE and all-cause mortality, among those initiating dialysis. These data must be interpreted with caution given the lack of randomization at dialysis start and low sample size. However, continuation of semaglu- tide after dialysis appears safe. While this report has the largest cohort of clinical trial participants who initiated dialysis while receiving treat- ment with semaglutide, more evidence is needed.

**Background and aims:**
Information about the effect of prolonged supraphysiological glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide 1-42 (GIP) exposure in type 2 diabetes is scarce. We investigated the effects of a six-week s.c. infusion of GIP alone and when added to once-weekly s.c. treatment with the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist semaglutide on glycaemic control and other metabolic outcomes in type 2 diabetes. We hypothesised that adding GIP to sema- glutide would enhance glycaemic control.

**Materials and methods:**
This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial involved 61 participants with type 2 dia- betes (18-75 years, BMI≥25 kg/m , ­HbA ≥6.5%, no GLP-1-based medications or insulin). Participants were first randomised (1:1) to 8 weeks of once-weekly s.c. semaglutide (initial 4 weeks, 0.25 mg, and then 4 weeks on 0.5 mg) or placebo, and then randomised (1:1) to a six-week continuous s.c. infusion of 16 pmol/kg/min GIP or placebo via an infusion pump as add-on to semaglutide 0.5 mg once-weekly or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in continuous glucose monitoring-assessed mean glucose levels from baseline to end of treat- ment; comparison 1: placebo+placebo vs. placebo+GIP; comparison 2: semaglutide+placebo vs. semaglutide+GIP. Differences were esti- mated using a constrained linear mixed model with 97.5% CI (primary endpoint) and 95% CI (secondary endpoints).

**Results:**
Differences in mean sensor-detected glucose change (pri- mary endpoint) were 0.80 mmol/l (CI -0.18 to 1.80, =0.07) (com- parison 1) and 0.05 mmol/l (CI -0.85 to 0.95, =0.90) (comparison 2), respectively. Differences in mean body weight change were 0.28 kg (CI -1.75 to 2.31, =0.78) (comparison 1) and -0.08 kg (CI -2.01 to 1.86, =0.94) (comparison 2), respectively. Differences in mean diastolic blood pressure were -5.3 mmHg (CI -10.5 to -0.04, 0.05) (comparison 1) and -0.52 mmHg (CI -5.02 to 3.98, =0.82) (com- parison 2), respectively. The most frequent adverse event was injection site reaction to the GIP infusion (58% of participants in GIP groups). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common and frequent in the semaglutide groups.

**Conclusion:**
In the present setting, six weeks of s.c. infusion of GIP, alone or in combination with 0.5 mg semaglutide once-weekly, did not affect mean glucose levels or body weight significantly in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

**A novel antibody-peptide conjugate targeting PCSK9, GLP-1R, GCGR, GIPR improves cardiovascular risk markers in preclini- cal study**

Y. Li, Wu, D. Ren

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular pathogenesis involves mul- tifactorial risks including dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and obesity. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protease that mediates low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation, thereby regulating plasma LDL-cholesterol lev- els. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), glucagon receptor (GCGR), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) are associated with metabolic regulation mechanisms includ- ing insulin secretion and energy expenditure. IBI3030 is a novel anti- PCSK9 antibody conjugated with triple-target (GLP-1R/GCGR/GIPR) agonist peptides, potentially offering enhanced therapeutic benefits for cardiovascular disease patients.

**Materials and methods:**
LDL-cholesterol uptake activity was assessed in HepG2 cells. Agonist potencies for GLP-1R/GCGR/GIPR were evaluated through cAMP accumulation assays. Three animal models (hPCSK9 knock-in mice, AAV8-hPCSK9-induced ob/ob mice, and rats) received IBI3030 treatment, with monitoring of body weight changes and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performance. Meta- bolic parameters including LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and blood glucose were measured longitudinally. Non-human primate (NHP) studies assessed toxicity and efficacy through body weight monitoring and cardiovascular biomarker analysis.

**Results:**
IBI3030 demonstrated comparable LDL-cholesterol uptake enhancement to commercial PCSK9 antibodies. The conjugate exhib- ited potent triagonist activity in cAMP assays (GLP-1R/GCGR/GIPR). Treatment significantly reduced LDL-cholesterol (p<0.01 vs baseline) and improved glucose tolerance across all models. Significant body weight reduction was observed with preserved insulin sensitivity. IBI3030 showed favorable tolerability up to 50 mg/kg in NHPs, with concurrent improvements in both GLP-1-associated (body weight, food consumption) and PCSK9-related pharmacodynamic markers.

**Conclusion:**
IBI3030 demonstrated concurrent improvements in cho- lesterol homeostasis, glycemic control, and obesity parameters across preclinical models. This novel bioconjugate shows potential for deliver- ing enhanced clinical benefits in cardiovascular disease management.

**Rising burden of diabetes, stroke, and ischaemic heart disease attributable to sugar-sweetened beverages among young adults: a global analysis and 30-year projection (1990-2051)**

C. Liu

**Background and aims:**
Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consump- tion has emerged as a critical public health concern globally. However, comprehensive analysis of its long-term impact on diabetes mellitus (DM), stroke, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality across differ- ent demographic and socioeconomic contexts remains limited.

**Materials and methods:**
Utilizing data from the Global Burden of Dis- ease Study 2021, we analyzed SSB-attributable mortality trends (1990- 2021) for DM, stroke, and IHD across 204 countries. Age-standardized mortality rates were stratified by demographic and socio-demographic index (SDI). Bayesian age-period-cohort modeling projected mortality trajectories to 2051.

**Results:**
Global deaths attributable to sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) increased significantly from 27,286 (95% UI: 42,134-11,099) in 1990 to 74,657 (95% UI: 115,575-33,724) in 2021. Diabetes mellitus (DM) mortality showed a steady rise (AAPC: 0.852%, 95% CI: 0.742- 0.963), while stroke mortality declined globally (AAPC: -1.554%, 95% CI: -1.687--1.420) but increased sharply among young adults aged 25-29 (AAPC: 1.192%, 95% CI: 1.015-1.370). Similarly, ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality decreased overall (AAPC: -0.793%, 95% CI: -0.905--0.682) but rose notably in the same age group (AAPC: 0.948%, 95% CI: 0.806-1.089). Projections to 2051 predict dramatic increases in SSB-related mortality among 25-29-year-olds, including a 400% rise for stroke, 72.73% for DM, and 61.79% for IHD, with low- middle SDI regions facing the greatest burden.

**Conclusion:**
Despite global declines in stroke and IHD mortality, young populations face accelerating SSB-related mortality, underscor- ing a critical disconnect between population-wide trends and youth- specific vulnerabilities. Urgent age-targeted policies—including SSB taxation, youth-focused dietary regulations, and preventive healthcare investments—are imperative to mitigate this escalating crisis, particu- larly in socioeconomically transitioning regions

**Background and aims:**
We assessed whether timing of moderate-to- vigorous physical activity (MVPA) derived from 24-hour accelerom- etry, independent from total daily MVPA, is associated with T2D risk in two independent studies.

**Materials and methods:**
We used prospective data from UK Biobank participants without diabetes mellitus history (N=87,986; mean age: 61.7 [SD:7.9] years) and cross-sectional data on glycemic measures in NHANES (N=6,998; mean age: 51.3 [SD:17.3] years). In UK Biobank, we examined associations between week averages of hourly MVPA with T2D incidence using multivariable-adjusted cox regression, which helped to determine data-driven time windows with similar T2D risk trends. We subsequently compared T2D risk in people with a pref- erence for MVPA within these time windows using Cox regression, adjusting for confounders and total daily MVPA. Multiple logistic regression was applied to examine the associations between hourly mean MVPA minutes and glycemic measures.

**Results:**
In UKB, Over a median of 7.5 years follow-up, 2140 partici- pants developed T2D. Three time windows were identified: morning (05:00-9:59), midday (10:00-14:59), afternoon-evening (15:00-24:00). Compared to those with MVPA preference in the morning, the risk of T2D was lower in people preferring MVPA in the afternoon-evening (HR=0.73, 95%CI: 0.61-0.87), and midday (HR=0.83, 95%CI: 0.70- 0.98), as well as for those without a clear MVPA timing preference (HR=0.77, 95%CI: 0.64-0.93). Similar trends were observed for MVPA preference with glycemic measures in NHANES.

**Conclusion:**
Independent of the total MVPA volume, MVPA during afternoon-evening was associated with the lowest risk of incident T2D and with lower glycemic measures. Although we have not addressed causality, timing of MVPA may play a role in T2D prevention.

**The association between statin therapy and the incidence of dia- betes, microvascular complications, and cardiovascular events in patients without pre-existing cardiovascular disease**

J. Kim

**Background and aims:**
Statins reduce cardiovascular risk, but their role in primary prevention and the potential risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) remains controversial. This study aimed to assess the association between statin initiation and the incidence of NODM, diabetes-related microvascular complications, and major adverse car- diovascular events (MACE) in individuals without pre-existing cardio- vascular disease (CVD).

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from the Korean Nation- wide Health Insurance Database (2006-2023), identifying individuals without baseline diabetes, CVD, cancer, or prior statin use. Participants who initiated statins within one year of baseline and continued for at least 180 days were classified as statin initiators; others were clas- sified as non-initiators. After 1:1 propensity score matching for age, sex, 10-year cardiovascular risk, and LDL-cholesterol levels, outcomes were assessed over 3 years and across the entire follow-up duration (mean 9.6 years). Outcomes included MACE, defined as ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, or cardiovascular death; all-cause mortality; NODM; and diabetes-related microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and diabetic foot disease.

**Results:**
Among 1,188,183 statin-eligible individuals based on NCEP- ATP III criteria, 208,790 (104,395 per group) were included in the matched analysis. The mean (SD) age was 55.9 (9.0) years, and 36.9% were male. Baseline fasting glucose and LDL-C were 96.1 (11.2) mg/ dL and 174.1 (23.9) mg/dL, respectively.Over 3 years, statin initiation was associated with a significantly lower risk of MACE (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50-0.65) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.49-0.68). A modest increase in NODM risk was observed (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01- 1.12), without a significant increase in microvascular complications (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97-1.24). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one MACE was 135, while the number needed to harm (NNH) for one additional NODM case was 552. Over the full follow-up, statin therapy remained associated with lower risks of MACE (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.77-0.82) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.95), with no significant increase in the incidence of NODM or diabetes- related complications.

**Conclusion:**
Primary prevention with stain was associated with reduced risk of MACE and all-cause mortality but required monitor- ing for diabetes risk. A personalized approach is needed to optimize benefits while minimizing potential risks.

2. Aalborg, Denmark, Steno Diabetes Centre North Denmark, Aalborg,
3. Denmark, Steno Diabetes Center North Jutland, Aalborg University

**Background and aims:**
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, yet con- cerns remain regarding their potential diabetogenic effects. While sys- temic GC-induced hyperglycemia is well documented, the metabolic consequences of inhaled and topical GCs remain less clear. This study aimed to assess the association between systemic, inhaled, and topical GC exposure and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosis in a large, registry-based case-control study.

**Materials and methods:**
Using data from the Danish National Patient Registry (2013-2021), we identified 124,508 adults diagnosed with T2DM and matched them 1:3 with 356,117 controls based on age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. GC exposure was categorized as systemic, inhaled, or topical, based on prescriptions redeemed within one year before T2DM diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression mod- els estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each GC category. Dose-response patterns were evaluated by stratifying exposure according to the number of redeemed prescriptions.

**Results:**
Systemic GC use demonstrated the strongest association with T2DM (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.14-1.36), primarily driven by predniso- lone (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.55-1.86) and hydrocortisone (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.18-2.03). Topical GC exposure was also associated with increased T2DM risk (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.14-1.32), with significant effects observed across potency groups (Group II: OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07-1.23; Group III: OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.17; Group IV: OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.08-1.25). Inhaled GCs showed no significant association with T2DM (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80-1.14). A clear dose- response relationship was observed for both systemic and topical GCs.

**Conclusion:**
Systemic and topical GCs are associated with an increased likelihood of T2DM, and a dose-dependent relationship supports a potential causal link. Inhaled GCs appear metabolically neutral. These findings highlight the importance of careful GC prescribing and call for future studies addressing dose intensity and other key confounders.

**Background and aims:**
CATALYST was the largest prospective study to-date to assess the prevalence of endogenous hypercortisolism in participants with difficult-to-control type 2 diabetes (T2D) using the dexamethasone suppression test (DST). CATALYST defined hypercor- tisolism as post-DST cortisol >1.8 μg/dL with dexamethasone ≥140 ng/dL, but the 95th percentile value for normal controls is 1.2 μg/dL. Our aim was to compare characteristics of participants in the CATA- LYST study with post-DST cortisol levels <1.2 μg/dL, 1.2-1.8 μg/dL, and >1.8 μg/dL.

**Materials and methods:**
In CATALYST, 1057 participants aged 18-80 years with difficult-to-treat T2D (defined as HbA1c 7.5-11.5% on ≥2 glucose-lowering medications with or without micro-/macrovascular complications or taking multiple blood pressure-lowering medications) were screened with a 1-mg DST. Individuals with common causes for false-positive DSTs were excluded. Baseline characteristics were assessed and summarized using descriptive statistics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed.

**Results:**
Post-DST cortisol levels were <1.2 μg/dL in 51%,1.2-1.8 μg/ dL in 25%, and >1.8 μg/dL in 24% of participants. Increasing post- DST cortisol correlated with more cardiac comorbidities (17%, 29%, 33%) and greater use of ≥3 blood-pressure medications (21%, 27%, 38%). Based on univariate analysis of medication use and comorbidi- ties, fewer differences were seen between participants with post-DST cortisol 1.2-1.8 μg/dL and >1.8 μg/dL vs participants with <1.2 μg/dL. Factors independently associated with post-DST cortisol >1.8 μg/dL vs 1.2-1.8 μg/dL included ethnicity ( =0.0011), fibrate use ( =0.0071), and blood-pressure medication use ( =0.0029).

**Conclusion:**
While current guidelines recommend a post-1-mg DST cortisol cutoff of 1.8 μg/dL for hypercortisolism screening, a continuum of cardiometabolic risk might exist as a function of non-suppressible cortisol. CATALYST explored patient characteristics associated with different values of post-DST cortisol to expand our understanding of the impact of any level of cortisol activity based on DST. Our findings suggest that further investigation of those with post-DST cortisol 1.2- 1.8 μg/dL may be warranted, as they show similarities to those above the current hypercortisolism diagnostic cutoff.

**Background and aims:**
Individuals with intellectual disability (ID) are at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Given that people with ID often face significant challenges in self-management and accessing appropriate healthcare, coexisting type 2 diabetes (T2D) may further increase their CVD risk. We investigated the association between ID and CVD risk in individuals with T2D in order to identify potential health disparities.

**Materials and methods:**
Using a nationwide database from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), we identified adults with T2D (aged ≥20 years) who received national health screening in 2015- 2016. Disability status was determined through the Korea National Disability Registration System (NRDS) linked to the NHIS database. The study population was initially categorized into groups with and without ID, and subsequently into 3 groups: those with ID, those with other disabilities, and those without any disabilities. Incident CVD was defined as the first diagnosis of either myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, using ICD-10 codes through December 2022. Cox propor- tional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for sociodemographic factors.

**Results:**
Among 2,062,821 adults with T2D, 4,574 (0.22%) had ID at baseline. Compared to individuals without ID, those with ID were younger, more obese, more likely to be women, and more likely to be prescribed insulin or triple combination drugs for diabetes therapy; however, they had a lower prevalence of comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia). Over a median follow-up of 6 years, 111,450 (5.4%) incident CVD cases were recorded: 258 cases (incident rate [IR] of 9.5 per 1,000 person-years) in the group with ID and 111,192 cases in the group without ID (IR of 10.1 per 1,000 person-years). Individuals with ID had a higher risk of overall CVD compared to those without ID (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.45-1.86). Increased risks were observed for both MI (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.23-1.75) and stroke (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.58-2.19). The cumulative incident CVD risk by ID status is shown in Figure. Compared to individuals without any disabilities, CVD risk was highest in those with ID (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.49-1.91), followed by those with other disabilities (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.33-1.37; for trend<.0001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed associations after further adjusting for comorbidities and diabetes-related factors.

**Conclusion:**
In this large, nationwide cohort of adults with T2D, ID was independently associated with CVD risk. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to reduce the cardiovascular risk in this vulnerable population.

3. Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, Research Program
4. sinki, Finland, Department of Nephrology, University of Helsinki

**Background and aims:**
Higher parity is associated with better health outcomes in the general population, while the impact of par- ity on vascular complications in women with type 1 diabetes has not been studied in detail. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the impact of parity on the risk of diabetic complications and mortal- ity in women with type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included 2,487 women with type 1 diabetes from the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study, grouped by parity: no (41.1%), one (23.8%), two (24.4%), and three or more (10.7%) pregnancies. We retrieved data on pregnancies, dia- betic complications, and deaths from national care registries until the end of 2020. Mean age at the end of follow-up was 53.8 years (interquartile range 44.4-62.7). Subgroup-analyses were performed in those ≥45 years (n=1,818), because we wanted to make sure that including women who have not reached their final delivery number does not affect the results.

**Results:**
Age at diabetes onset and calendar year of diabetes onset were high with higher parity. The odds ratios for coronary artery disease events, myocardial infarction, hospitalization due to heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular disease events, initiation of kidney replacement therapy, and death by parity are presented in Table 1, all analyses are adjusted for calendar year of diabetes onset and diabetes onset age. Multiparous women had lower odds for all outcomes. Nul- liparous and uniparous women differed only regarding heart failure and mortality. In subgroup-analyses of those ≥45 years at the end of follow-up, the results were largely unchanged.

**Conclusion:**
Multiparous women have fewer diabetic complica- tions and lower mortality compared to nulliparous women, while uniparous women have less heart failure and lower mortality com- pared to nulliparous women. Pregnancy can motivate women to maintain a strict glucose balance, which seems to have long term benefits. Therefore, these data provide clinicians useful informa- tion when discussing family planning with women living with type 1 diabetes.

**Glycaemic control and daily insulin requirement in mothers of LGA and eutrophic newborns in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with sensor-augmented insulin pumps: a retrospective cohort study**

R. Sibiak, Wender-Ozegowska

1. Department of Reproduction, Poznan University of Medical Sciences,
2. Poznan, Poland, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan,

**Background and aims:**
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is linked to improved pregnancy outcomes. The primary study objective was to analyze glycemic con- trol and detailed insulin requirement throughout gestation between the mothers of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) and appropriate-for- gestational-age (AGA) newborns in patients with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study. We selected 173 eligible pregnant women with T1D who were treated with sensor-augmented pumps from the first trimester. Pregnant patients attended at least one control visit per trimester for routine anthropometric and laboratory assessments. The study group was divided into mothers of LGA and AGA newborns. Using pump and CGM data, we calculated glycemic control parameters for each tri- mester and insulin requirement parameters for each week of pregnancy.

**Results:**
Most patients in the entire study group (n = 173) met the cri- teria for well-controlled T1D, defined by median HbA1c and time-in- range (TIR [63-140 mg/dL]) target values. The median HbA1c values (%) were as follows: I trimester - 6.29 (5.94-6.95), II trimester - 5.56 (5.16-5.96), and III trimester - 5.80 (5.42-6.30). The median TIR values (%) were: I trimester - 71.0 (63.7-77.3), II trimester - 72.2 (64.7-79.1), and III trimester - 74.6 (66.4-82.3). While 32% (56/173) of pregnancies were complicated by LGA, 9% (16/173) of neonates were classified as SGA. Mothers of LGA compared to AGA infants had significantly higher HbA1c levels in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy: II trimester, 5.39 (5.10-5.76) vs. 5.80 (5.49-6.07), < 0.001, and III trimester, 5.75 (5.32-6.20) vs. 6.10 (5.60-6.41), = 0.002. Moreover, they spent less time within the target glucose range in each trimester: in the I trimester, 71.3 (67.4-80.3) vs. 68.9 (59.5-74.4), = 0.003; in the II trimester, 75.2 (67.1-81.4) vs. 67.5 (61.6-73.2), < 0.001; and in the III trimester, 77.6 (71.3-83.5) vs. 70.4 (62.0-78.8), = 0.001. There were no differences in the percentage of time spent in hypoglycemia, defined as glucose levels below 63 mg/dL and 54 mg/dL. Addition- ally, no significant differences were observed in age, diabetes duration, age at diabetes diagnosis, body weight and BMI at the beginning of pregnancy and delivery, total gestational weight gain, or triglyceride levels in any trimester. No significant differences were found in total daily insulin or meal bolus doses at any week of pregnancy. However, significant differences were observed in the mean daily basal insulin doses at weeks 14, 16, and 17 and from weeks 26 to 36 of pregnancy. In each case, mothers of LGA infants had higher daily basal insulin doses. Moreover, mothers of LGA infants exhibited a significantly elevated basal-bolus insulin ratio at weeks 9, 11-13, 16-19, 21-25, and 27-39 of pregnancy.

**Conclusion:**
Despite overall good glycemic control in most pregnant women with T1D, higher HbA1c levels in the second and third trimes- ters, lower TIR, and increased basal insulin requirements mostly in the early second and third trimester were associated with the LGA. These findings highlight the need for closer monitoring and potential adjust- ments in insulin therapy to mitigate the risk of excessive fetal growth.

**Background and aims:**
Early diagnosis of intermediate hyperglycemia (IH) enables timely intervention to reduce progression to diabetes mel- litus (DM). The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) 2024 criteria define IH and DM based on 1h post-load plasma glucose (PG) levels (≥8.6 mmol/L for IH, ≥11.6 mmol/L for DM) after a 75 g glucose load. These criteria are sensitive, cost-effective, and allow diagnosis ~1.5 years earlier than with usual criteria. Additionally, IH diagnosis after 1h PG, according to ­IDF strongly predicts progression to DM and is associated to higher risk of diabetes-related complications and mortal- ity. However, its impact on postpartum reassessment of women with gestational diabetes (GDM) remains unevaluated.In this study we aim, in women with GDM:1) To assess the impact of the ­IDF vs. Expert Committee2003/ADA2004 ­(EC /ADA ) and ­WHO criteria on glucose tolerance assessment in the first year postpartum.2) To analyze intrapregnancy variables associated with changes in glucose tolerance classification.

**Materials and methods:**
Descriptive and analytical study conducted on 1217 women diagnosed with GDM, evaluated in the first year post- partum. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (chi-square test, ANOVA, and multinomial regression), p<0.05.

**Results:**
Intrapregnancy characteristics: age: 32.4 years, prepregnancy BMI 24.24 kg/m², Caucasian ethnicity 98.6%, gestational age at diag- nosis 26.96 weeks, insulin treatment 54.1%. Changing from ­EC / ADA to ­IDF criteria, 28.4% women experienced a change in diagnostic category (unfavorable 26.6, favorable 1.9%). The rate of dysglycemia increased from 29.1% to 48.9% (p<0.01, see table). Pre- dictive variables for diagnostic reclassification included: family his- tory of DM, diabetes-related autoimmunity, plasma glucose values at 1 and 3h during the pregnancy OGTT and first intrapregnancy HbA1c value (R² = 0.057)If ­WHO criteria had been initially applied, 39% of women would have changed the diagnostic category (unfavorable 37.1%, favorable 1.9%). The rate of dysglycemia increased from 17.4% to 48.9% (p<0.001). Predictors for diagnostic reclassification would be in line with those observed for ­EC /ADA ->IDF .

**Conclusion:**
The glycemic reassessment of women with GDM in the ­1 year postpartum, applying ­IDF instead of ­EC /ADA or ­WHO criteria:1) Reclassifies 29% and 39% of women, respectively, into a different diagnostic category, with the majority showing a worse glycemic status with roughly 50% of women displaying dysglycemia2) Intrapregnancy characteristics were not strong predictors of changes in diagnostic classification.

**Background and aims:**
The metabolome may serve as both a mediator of in-utero glycaemic influences on offspring metabolic health and a potential indicator of metabolic health in offspring. This study aimed to identify associations of children’s metabolites with childhood adi- posity and glucose metabolism, and to examine how maternal glycae- mia during pregnancy shapes the offspring metabolome from birth to childhood.

**Materials and methods:**
Using the Nightingale NMR platform, we profiled 104 metabolites in umbilical cord blood samples from 647 newborns and 245 metabolites in serum from 213 children at age 7 within the Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) Study and HAPO follow-up study at the Hong Kong centre. Maternal glucose levels were measured via oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during pregnancy. Childhood metabolic assessments included glucose levels (0-120min 5-point OGTT), adiposity, and insulin sensitivity/β- cell function. We used multiple linear and logistic regression models to analyse metabolite associations with maternal glycaemia and child- hood outcomes, with mediation analysis for metabolic pathways. Sex- stratified analyses were performed post hoc after observing sex-specific patterns in our initial results.

**Results:**
Umbilical cord blood lipoprotein subclasses and glycolysis- related metabolites showed specific associations with maternal fasting glucose (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p<0.05) but not with 1h or 2h glucose levels, and these birth metabolites did not correlate with later childhood metabolic or adiposity outcomes. At age 7, 84 adipos- ity-associated metabolites were identified. Among these metabolites, various lipid levels show particularly strong association: the triglyc- erides-to-total lipids ratio in chylomicrons and extremely large VLDL particles exhibited the highest risk (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.68-9.47), while the corresponding cholesterol-to-lipids ratio showed protection (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16-0.61). Few metabolites showed significant associa- tions with maternal glucose levels, with only lactate showing a sig- nificant correlation to maternal 2h glucose. Cross-sectional mediation analyses suggested that free cholesterol-to-total lipids ratio in chylomi- crons/extremely large VLDL may mediated maternal glucose effects on adiposity (ACME=0.018, p=0.028). Notably, sex-stratified analy- ses uncovered more extensive mediation effects in female than male offspring, where multiple relative lipoprotein lipid level significantly mediated maternal glucose-offspring adiposity relationships.

**Conclusion:**
Umbilical cord blood metabolites associate with maternal glycaemia but show no significant association with later childhood met- abolic outcomes. Our findings indicate that while maternal glycaemia influences metabolism at birth, this effect does not appear to persist into childhood. In contrast, specific age 7 serum metabolites strongly asso- ciate with childhood adiposity and may mediate maternal metabolic programming effects on child health. These age 7 metabolites may contribute to early risk identification and targeted intervention.

**Background and aims:**
Impaired glucose excursions in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) are linked to maternal-neonatal complications such as large for gestational age babies. Exercise is a promising strategy with the potential to optimize short-term glyce- mic responses and prevent these complications. However, it remains unknown which timing of acute exercise (before or after a main meal) is more effective to optimize postprandial glycemic control in pregnant women T1DM. This is especially relevant in T1DM since the amount of prandial insulin in circulation is often different when exercising before lunch vs. after lunch, which considerably affects glucose excur- sions. We aimed to determine which timing of exercise (before or after lunchtime) is more effective to optimize postprandial glycemic control (18-h, 4-h, and night periods) in women with T1DM at early-middle and late gestation.

**Materials and methods:**
Randomized crossover trial. Eight pregnant women with T1DM at early-middle and late gestation underwent 2 experimental conditions: pre-meal and post-meal exercise. These tests were conducted on 3 non-consecutive days within an 8-day period. On the ­1 day, women underwent a resting energy expenditure (REE) test followed by an incremental walk test using a gas analyzer, which allowed us to standardize meal energy content and exercise intensity in the experimental days. In the pre-meal and post-meal exercise days, the meal intake consisted of a mixed milkshake equivalent to 35% of women’s REE, and the exercise stimulus of 35 min walking at an intensity that was equivalent to the 1st ventilatory threshold. Glucose excursions were monitored for 8 days using Dexcom G7 continuous glucose monitoring systems.

**Results:**
In early-middle pregnancy, during the 18-h period, women spent 10% more time in euglycemia (p=0.03) and 6% less time in hyperglycemia (p=0.07), and exhibited lower glucose variability (p<0.03), when they exercised after lunchtime compared to before lunchtime. During the 4-h period, similar but non-significant trends were observed. During the nighttime, post-meal exercise was associ- ated with 16% higher time in euglycemia (p=0.03) and 12% lower time in hypoglycemia (p=0.02). The results were not influenced by carbohy- drate or insulin requirements, or appetite (p>0.05). In late pregnancy, postprandial glucose responses were similar when exercising before vs. after lunch.

**Conclusion:**
Post-meal exercise is more effective to optimize postpran- dial glucose excursions in pregnant women with T1DM at early-middle gestation compared to pre-meal exercise. Considering exercise timing in the practice could be a powerful and simple tool for enhancing gly- cemic control in early-middle gestation. As for late gestation, pre- and post-meal exercise seems to be comparably effective.

**Appendicular lean mass, grip strength and risk of gestational diabetes**

F. Lai

**Background and aims:**
Skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in main- taining glucose homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the causal- ity of association between skeletal muscle health indicators, including appendicular lean mass (ALM) and grip strength, and the risk of ges- tational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

**Materials and methods:**
A cross-sectional study was performed to assess the relationship between GDM history and ALM/grip strength among women aged 20-59 years with a history of childbirth from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES). A two-sample Men- delian randomization analysis was used to examine the causal associa- tion using summary statistics from the UK Biobank and the FinnGen consortium.

**Results:**
Among 1,890 women in the NHANES with a history of childbirth, 229 had a history of GDM (weighted percentage, 10.4%) and showed significantly lower relative ALM and grip strength ( < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression models revealed inverse associa- tions between GDM history and both relative ALM (β= −14.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −24.78 to −4.07, = 0.009) and grip strength (β = −0.10, 95% CI: −0.19 to −0.01, = 0.026). Mendelian randomi- zation determined that lower ALM (odds ratio = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.72- 0.87, < 0.001) and grip strength (odds ratio = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.93, = 0.019) were associated with an increased risk of GDM.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrated a causal relationship between elevated risk of GDM and poor muscle health marked by reduced ALM and grip strength. The finding highlighted the importance of preserving and enhancing skeletal muscle mass and strength to prevent GDM in women of reproductive age.

**Background and aims:**
The gut-derived hormone glucose-depend- ent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP[1-42]) increases circulating glucagon levels during normal-to-low plasma glucose concentrations in persons with type 1 diabetes; potentially safeguarding against hypoglycaemia. Here, we evaluated the effects of exogenous GIP[1- 42] and its naturally occurring truncated variant GIP[1-30]NH , on glucagon secretion during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in persons with type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
In a randomised, double-blind, placebo- controlled, crossover study involving five hypoglycaemic clamps, we evaluated persons with type 1 diabetes. Each clamp experiment was ini- tiated at euglycaemia and involved an i.v. infusion (time 0-135 min) of GIP[1-42] (4 or 8 pmol/kg/min), GIP[1-30]NH (4 or 8 pmol/kg/min), or placebo (saline), respectively. During all experiments, insulin (1.5 mU/kg/min) was continuously infused to induce hypoglycaemia while blood glucose levels above 2.5 mmol/l were maintained with a variable glucose infusion from time 30-90 min, followed by a recovery period from 90-135 min. The primary outcome was plasma glucagon baseline- subtracted AUC (bsAUC) and secondary outcomes included absolute plasma glucagon concentrations and amount of glucose infused.

**Results:**
Ten persons with type 1 diabetes were included (age: 31±10 years [mean±SD], BMI: 24±3 kg/m , ­HbA : 48.8±6.7 mmol/mol, stimulated C-peptide: 31±22 pmol/l). No significant differences were found in total bsAUC for glucagon between interventions compared to placebo. However, both GIP variants showed an increase in plasma glucagon values at time 30 minutes compared to placebo ( < 0.05), and a decline following insulin infusion (fig. 1B). During the high- dose GIP[1-42] infusion, less glucose was required to recover from hypoglycaemia compared to placebo ( < 0.05) (fig. 1A).

**Conclusion:**
In persons with type 1 diabetes, exogenous GIP[1-42] and GIP[1-30]NH both increase plasma glucagon levels during eug- lycaemia but insulin-induced hypoglycaemia eliminates this effect. Nevertheless, high-dose GIP[1-42] reduces the amount of glucose needed to recover from hypoglycaemia.

**Background and aims:**
Elevated intact proinsulin and its conver- sion intermediates (further referred to as PI) and the PI:C-peptide ratio (PI/C) precede and accompany stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, their potential as minimally invasive/cheaper alternatives to repeated OGTT and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for predicting impending clinical onset in presymptomatic T1D has not been comprehensively investigated in longitudinal studies. Using longitudinal data of first-degree relatives (FDRs) with presympto- matic T1D, followed in a multicenter study by the Belgian Diabetes Registry, we evaluated the performance of PI and PI/C against CGM surrogates, ­HbA and OGTT metrics for prediction of stage 3 T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
N=34 lean FDRs with a baseline median (range) age of 17 (6-36 years) were followed for a median (IQR) of 3.5 (2.0-7.5) years. HbA1c, 2h OGTT and 5 days of blinded iPro2 CGM (Medtronic) were repeated every 6 months. PI was deter- mined in fasting samples by a sensitive immunoassay (detection limit <1pmol/L) measuring total PI-like material. Baseline char- acteristics and patterns over time were compared based on progres- sion status. Prediction of stage 3 T1D was assessed by baseline Cox proportional hazards models and extended Cox with time-varying covariates in multiple record data (n=197 OGTTs and concomitant CGM) adjusted for intra-individual correlating observations (cor- rected Akaike information criterion [AICc]).

**Results:**
After a median (IQR) of 40 (20-91) months, 17/34 FDRs developed stage 3 T1D. Baseline traits (including PI and PI/C) and follow-up time of progressors and non-progressors did not differ, except for slightly lower BMI and stimulated C-peptide in progressors. Spaghetti plots unveiled a rise of PI and PI/C close to onset, in parallel with OGTT and CGM metrics, all with con- siderable intra- and interindividual variability. Intra-individual variability of PI/C was less after adjustment for HOMA2-IR. In a multivariable model of fasting baseline data (AICc = 84.7), glucose and HOMA2-IR-adjusted PI/C were selected as significant predic- tors of stage 3 T1D, but were less informative than the best CGM (% time ≥140mg/dL; AICc = 80.9) or stimulated OGTT metrics (AUC C-peptide/glucose; AICc = 78.3). In univariable extended Cox regression, HOMA2-IR-adjusted PI/C (AICc = 76.7) outper- formed ­HbA (AICc = 80.4), and nearly matched the best CGM metric (% time ≥120mg/dL; AICc = 75.1), but not AUC C-peptide/ glucose (AICc = 60.4). HOMA2-IR-adjusted PI/C complemented ­HbA (AICc = 68.7). Conditional forward entry of fasting vari- ables, ­HbA and CGM metrics selected HOMA2-IR-adjusted PI/C, CGM-derived glucose SD and ­HbA as the most informative model (AICc = 61.8), nearly matching the combination of AUC glucose, AUC C-peptide and ­HbA (AICc = 58.9).

**Conclusion:**
Similar to findings at clinical onset, rising PI/C levels predict further beta cell function loss. Combined with HbA1c, moni- toring HOMA2-IR-adjusted PI/C may serve as less burdening alter- native to more cumbersome/costly repeated OGTT or CGM metrics.

**Risk of future diabetes in single glutamate decarboxylase autoan- tibody positive adults**

S.L. Grace, Group, A.E. Long, K.M. Gillespie

**Background and aims:**
Approximately 80% of those diagnosed with autoimmune diabetes are positive for autoantibodies (Ab) to glutamate decarboxylase (GADA) and single GADA positivity is common at diagnosis in adults. The frequency of screening studies has increased recently in response to the success of immunotherapy trials, but robust risk data are needed to inform single GADA posi- tive study participants, especially those identified in adulthood.

**Materials and methods:**
From 6115 adult relatives participating in the Bart’s Oxford (BOX) family study, 199 (3%; median age at sampling 37.9y [range 18.1-65.8], median follow-up 10.8y [range 0.2-37]) were identified as GADA positive by the full-length radi- obinding assay. Diabetes progression was observed in 53 (27%). Of 3569 islet autoantibody negative relatives (median age at sampling 39.1y [range 18-87.4], median follow-up 0.1-37.9]), 196 (5%) devel- oped diabetes. Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan Meier survival curves were used to assess risk of diabetes progression.

**Results:**
Of 199 GADA positive adult relatives, 150 (75%) were single GADA positive. As expected, those that screened multiple Ab positive were at the highest risk of diabetes progression (41% 10-year risk, HR 16.4 [95% CI 10.9-24.5], p<0.001). Single GADA positives were at a higher risk of diabetes progression than those relatives that screened Ab negative; 12% 10-year risk (HR 3.9 [95% CI 2.6-5.8], p<0.001) vs. 2% 10-year risk. Higher GADA levels further stratified risk of future diabetes in the single GADA positive individuals: 39% 10-year risk for levels ≥450 DK U/ml (HR 8.3 [95% CI 4.4-15.7], p<0.001), compared with 9% 10-year risk for levels lower than 450 DK U/ml (HR 2.9 [95% CI 1.8-4.9], p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Single GADA positivity carries a 6-times higher 10-year risk of diabetes progression than autoantibody negatives. Those with high GADA levels have similar 10-year risk of progres- sion to those who screened multiple Ab positive. These individuals could be considered for inclusion in prevention studies.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic reprogramming is crucial in the function and differentiation of immune cells, thus playing a funda- mental role in disease development. By employing metabolomics and transcriptomics, we investigated the molecular immunopheno- type of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

**Materials and methods:**
PBMCs from healthy controls (CTRLs, n = 10), patients with T1D (n = 11), multiple sclerosis (MS, n = 8), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 14), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 10) were extracted and the cell metabolome was analysed using UHPLC-HRMS. RNA from PBMCs was isolated, and sequenc- ing was performed by synthesis. Hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts 2 was performed. After data quality and extraneous variable control, metabolite levels and differential gene expression were analysed. Principal component analysis was used for pattern analysis and weighted correlation network analysis for summarization of gene expression patterns. Metabolite pathway and gene enrichment analyses were performed using over-representation and over-expression approaches with a threshold of 0.05 for false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value.

**Results:**
PBMC-omics profiles showed a unique molecular pattern in the clustering of T1D samples with CTRLs in contrast to other autoimmune diseases. While most metabolites were increased sig- nificantly in MS, SLE and RA compared to CTRLs (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05), T1D only exhibited decreases in polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to CTRLs. Aligned with this, we found that most of the differentiated genes in T1D showed decreased expres- sion levels, while in other autoimmune diseases, most of the relevant genes exhibited increased expression levels compared to CTRLs (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05). Metabolite enrichment analysis indicated a pronounced activation of energy and amino acid-related pathways in MS, RA and SLE compared to CTRLs, while these were marginally affected in T1D. Complementary, a pronounced disruption of cellular energy processes in MS, RA and SLE was accompanied by gene deregulation associated with oxidative phos- phorylation. The processes affected in T1D were predominantly sig- nal transduction pathways with immune-related functions and lipid metabolic processes emerging as the principal drivers of the T1D- specific molecular pattern. Moreover, top hub genes associated with T1D-specific expression patterns were involved in the production and transport of lipid mediators. Analysis of metabolic functions of main deregulated genes in T1D revealed activation of fatty acid and glycan metabolism, and suppression of pathways related to inflammatory signalling in cytokine and chemokine networks.

**Conclusion:**
T1D immune cells exhibited phenotypic features of CTRLs, with a molecular profile that markedly diverges from other autoimmune diseases. This indicates that T1D may necessitate thera- peutic strategies beyond typical immunomodulatory approaches.

**Background and aims:**
There are presently no reliable ways to quan- tify beta cell mass , which hampers the understanding of the natural history of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the development of novel therapies to preserve beta cell mass. To address this major unmet need, novel and specific beta cell biomarkers must be identified and validated. We have previously identified Dipeptidyl Peptidase Like 6 (DPP6) as a promising islet cell surface marker. DPP6 is mainly expressed by human beta cells and to a lesser extent by alpha cells. We have devel- oped single-domain antibodies (sdAb) against DPP6 (4hD29) and pres- ently aimed to confirm the specific 4hD29 sdAb binding to human islets and then to adapt it for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, as PET is the modality to be used in future clinical trials.

**Materials and methods:**
4hD29 was conjugated with an Alexa Fluor 594 Dye (Alexa-4hD29) or radiolabelled using a 68Ge/68Ga generator to obtain a ­[ Ga]Ga-NOTA-4hD29 suitable for PET imaging. Alexa- 4hD29 was used for in vitro studies in EndoC-βH1 and iPSC derived islet-like cells, including labelling efficiency and stability, cell specific- ity, internalization and degradation. Alexa-4hD29 was also tested for species (human, mouse, pig, and Cynomolgus macaque pancreata) and human islet specificity (based on a tissue array containing 42 different tissues). ­[ Ga]Ga-NOTA-4hD29 was used to evaluate and stability, and biodistribution in rats and pigs, autoradiography, human predicted dosimetry, PET in dif- ferent human tissues for specificity, followed by PET scanning of stem cell derived islets (SC-islets) or isolated human islets implanted into immunodeficient mice.

**Results:**
After binding to the human beta cell surface, 50% of the Alexa-4hD29 signal was still detectable inside the cells 2h after the preincubation step. 28% and 31% intracellular Alexa-4hD29 located inside the late endosomes in respectively EndoC-βH1 and iPSC derived islet-like cells. Alexa-4hD29 showed binding specificity for human and Cynomolgus macaque islets but not for mouse or pig islets. Analysis of Alexa-4hD29 in a human tissue array showed binding to human islets but no binding to 42 other human tissues, including heart, liver, uterus or brain. Biodistribution analysis of ­[ Ga]Ga-NOTA-4hD29 revealed predominant clearance through the kidneys and rapid excretion of the tracer into the urine of rats and pigs. autoradiography showed specific preference for human islets, with the signal positively cor- related with islet purity (r=0.98) and abolished by preincubation with unconjugated 4hD29. PET scan analysis of SC-islets or isolated human islets implanted into immunodeficient mice showed detectable binding for the tracer to grafts containing as low as 400 islets.

**Conclusion:**
The present results support the use of the 4hD29 sdAb targeting DPP6 for a first-in-human study to determine beta- cell-mass by PET imaging.

**Background and aims:**
Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) is a common complication of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), significantly affect- ing patients’ quality of life and straining healthcare systems. Despite its prevalence, the lack of validated biomarkers for early detection and prognosis remains a major clinical challenge. Dyslipidemia, marked by an abnormal lipid profile, is increasingly recognized as a key risk factor for diabetic neuropathy, independent of glycemic status. Using LC-MS lipidomics, this study aims to identify novel lipid biomarkers and uncover the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying DSPN in T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
The discovery cohort included 153 individu- als with T1D (109 with and 44 without DSPN) and 50 non-diabetic controls. An independent validation cohort of 101 individuals with T1D was used for confirmation. DSPN diagnosis was based on DPN- Check and intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) in the discovery cohort, and nerve conduction testing in the validation cohort. Untar- geted serum lipidomics was performed using LC-QTOF MS, with data preprocessing in Skyline and semi-quantification via internal standards. Machine learning identified key lipids, followed by ANCOVA and post- hoc tests to adjust for clinical confounders. Targeted lipid profiling of 520 species using LC-QqQ MS was conducted in a confirmation cohort (676 T1D individuals, 51 controls) to ensure biomarker reliability.

**Results:**
In the discovery cohort, untargeted lipidomics detected 543 lipid species across 19 classes. Machine learning identified 42 key lipids, including triglycerides (TG), ceramides (Cer), glycerophospho- lipids (GPLs), and fatty acids (FAs). Statistical analysis highlighted 14 DSPN-associated lipids, with 8 showing significant differences between DSPN and non-DSPN individuals. Specifically, Cer(d42:1), PC(36:4), LPC(16:0), and PE(36:2) were decreased, while LPE(18:1) and PE(O-40:5)/PE(P-40:4) were elevated in DSPN (p < 0.05). Vali- dation confirmed 6 of these 8 lipids, maintaining the same directional changes. A linear model combining these lipids with HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure, and age achieved an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.76-0.91) in the discovery cohort and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73-0.90) in validation, effectively distinguishing DSPN in T1D. Targeted lipidomics in the confirmation cohort aims to further enhance biomarker selection and improve diagnostic accuracy.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights MS-based lipidomics as a power- ful tool for identifying lipid biomarkers of DSPN. These biomarkers offer insights into DSPN-related metabolic disturbances and may aid early diagnosis and personalized management in T1D.

**Background and aims:**
While clustering of diabetic complications has become increasingly apparent, the relationship between diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and stroke in individuals with type 1 diabetes remains largely unexplored. Thus, we aimed to uncover if individuals with type 1 diabetes with signs of DPN are at a greater risk of stroke independently of other diabetic vascular complications.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included 3,005 participants with type 1 diabetes from the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDi- ane) Study. All participants were free of stroke at baseline and had completed the FinnDiane Neuropathy Questionnaire, from which the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument Questionnaire (MNSI-Q) score was calculated. Incident strokes, until end of 2020, were identified from national registries and confirmed from medi- cal records. Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to evalu- ate DPN as an independent stroke risk factor, adjusting for other diabetes complications and traditional risk factors for stroke, such as age, duration of diabetes, sex, HbA1c, kidney function, systolic blood pressure, and BMI. Due to the lacking consensus concerning the optimal cutoff MNSI-Q score for DPN, the analyses were done separately using both ≥4 and ≥7 points.

**Results:**
At baseline, 30.0% of participants scored MNSI-Q ≥4 points, whilst 12.1% scored ≥7. During a median follow-up of 9.8 years (inter- quartile range: 8.0-9.9), 123 (4.1%) participants suffered a stroke. Indi- viduals with incident stroke scored higher with both cutoff points for DPN (MNSI-Q ≥4 59.3% vs 28.7%, MNSI-Q ≥7 23.6% vs 11.0 %, p<0.001), were older (55.5±9.9 vs 47.2±12.4 years, p<0.001), had a longer diabetes duration (36.1±11.6 vs 29.7±12.2 years, p<0.001), and a higher prevalence of other chronic diabetes complications, such as kidney failure (23.6% vs 6.0%), cardiovascular disease (22.0% vs 10.4%), peripheral vascular disease (20.3% vs 4.8%), and prolif- erative diabetic retinopathy (50.4 % vs 27.2%), p<0.001 for all. In adjusted analyses, DPN was consistently an independent risk factor for stroke, with HR estimates across 12 models ranging from 1.82 to 3.96 (p<0.02) for MNSI-Q ≥4 and HR 2.56 to 5.05 (p< 0.001) for MNSI-Q ≥7.

**Conclusion:**
DPN was strongly associated with an increased stroke risk for individuals with type 1 diabetes, independent of other diabetic vas- cular complications. Screening for DPN with MNSI-Q could contribute to risk-stratification for stroke risk in people with type 1 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Chronic neuropathic pain (NeuP) presents a clinical challenge due to unpredictable treatment responses and a lack of reliable biomarkers. This study applies machine learning (ML) to neuroimaging data to develop predictive models, enabling personalised pain management and improved clinical decision-making.

**Materials and methods:**
Multisite neuroimaging data were analysed from 76 patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (Sheffield and Oxford datasets) and 56 patients with osteoarthritis (OpenNeuro dataset). Treatment responders were defined as those with a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) <4 or at least a 30% reduction in NRS post-treatment, while non-responders had a score >4 without such reduction. Neuroim- aging data included structural MRI (sMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). sMRI features were extracted using FreeSurfer, provid- ing cortical and subcortical volumetric measures. rs-fMRI functional connectivity was processed using fMRIPrep, incorporating motion correction, spatial normalisation (ICBM152 space), and parcellation into 64 brain regions using the DiFuMo atlas. A supervised ML frame- work trained models using Sheffield and Oxford data, with external validation on OpenNeuro. To enhance model robustness and gener- alisability, harmonisation techniques (NeuroComBat and Maximum Independence Domain Adaptation) were applied to reduce inter-site differences. A range of ML algorithms were tested, including logis- tic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and ridge regression. Bayesian hyperparameter tuning optimised model performance, selecting the best pre-processing steps and determining whether domain adaptation should incorporate target labels. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) was the primary evaluation metric, alongside AUROC, recall, and specificity to ensure robust classifica- tion performance.

**Results:**
In the Sheffield cohort, the best-performing model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.689, recall of 0.796, AUROC of 0.806, and MCC of 0.407. When the Sheffield and Oxford datasets were com- bined, the best-performing model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.693, recall of 0.75, specificity of 0.667, AUROC of 0.705, and MCC of 0.382 when tested on the OpenNeuro cohort. Notably, the model’s ability to predict placebo responders was poor, with a balanced accu- racy of 0.502, recall of 0.548, specificity of 0.455, AUROC of 0.503, and MCC of 0.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ML-based neuroimaging biomarkers to predict treatment response in NeuP. By successfully implementing MRI data harmonisation and optimised ML pipelines, we establish a foundation for a multimodal AI framework in NeuP research. External validation confirms the model’s robust- ness across multiple datasets, though challenges remain in differen- tiating true treatment effects from placebo response. Future research should prioritise larger validation cohorts, refined feature selection, and improved model interpretability to support clinical translation and real-world application.

**Pilavapadin, an oral, non-opioid, AAK1 inhibitor for diabetic**

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP) is a debilitating diabetes complication affecting ~30% of people with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 (T2D) diabetes. Current therapies offer limited relief with frequent adverse effects highlighting the need for innova- tive approaches.

**Materials and methods:**
PROGRESS was a phase 2b study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pilavapadin (LX9211), a non-opioid inhibitor of adaptor-associated kinase 1 (AAK1), in adults with T1D or T2D and moderate or severe DPNP. Primary outcome was change in average daily pain score (ADPS) after 8 weeks of once daily placebo (PBO) or one of three pilavapadin doses [10 mg, 20/10 mg (20 mg x 7 days then 10 mg), or 20 mg].

**Results:**
A total of 496 participants (mean age 61.5, 41% women, 32% Black, 31% on background therapies, and baseline ADPS of 6.9) were randomized. All treatment arms showed significant improvement in ADPS from baseline (p<0.001), with numerically greater least squares mean (SE) differences from PBO for the 10 mg [-0.42 (0.27)] and 20/10 mg [-0.40 (0.27)] arms. A post hoc analysis excluding the 20 mg arm indicated significance (p<0.04) (Figure 1a), showing an early separation from PBO that persisted throughout the study. Additionally, pilavadapin 10 mg was associated with a numerically greater reduction from baseline in daily sleep interference (DSI) [-1.60 (0.196) vs. -1.19 (0.196)] (Figure 1b) and burning pain [-1.6 (0.25) vs. -1.1 (0.25)] com- pared to PBO. Pilavadapin 10 mg was generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being dizziness and nausea.

**Conclusion:**
These data support the advancement of pilavapadin 10 mg into Phase 3 trials as a promising non-opioid treatment for DPNP

**Background and aims:**
Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is closely linked to cognitive dysfunction, which is increas- ingly recognized as a comorbidity of chronic pain. The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy, but its contribution, along with related metabolites, to PDPN compli- cated by cognitive impairment remains poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the characteristics of gut microbiota and metabolites in / mice with PDPN and concomitant cognitive impairment, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.

**Materials and methods:**
Male BKS-DB (Lepr) ( / ) mice were used as the experimental group, with age-matched / mice serving as controls. Pain sensitivity was assessed using thermal and mechani- cal sensitivity tests, while cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris water maze. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density and nerve fiber markers were assessed via immunohistochemistry, and proinflamma- tory cytokine levels were measured by Western blot. The structure of the gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region sequencing, and fecal metabolites were examined using liquid chroma- tography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

**Results:**
At 12 weeks of age, / mice exhibited significantly lower thermal and mechanical sensitivities, as well as reduced intraepider- mal nerve fiber density compared to / mice. Cognitive deficits were also observed, with / mice showing longer escape laten- cies and fewer platform crossings in the Morris water maze. The gut microbiota composition differed between the two groups, with LEfSe analysis identifying 38 key amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) enriched in / mice and 39 ASVs more abundant in / mice. Fecal metabolite analysis revealed a significant increase in Dl-lactate, allantoic acid, and tyramine in / mice, while polygalic acid and gly-pro-arg-pro-amide were notably decreased. Bidirectional mediation models indicated that Dl-lactate positively mediated the relationship between specific microbiota ( (ASV243) and (ASV149)) and thermal latency. In contrast, polygalic acid negatively mediated the relationship between and escape latency, as well as between and thermal latency. These microbiota and metabolite changes were associated with elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and hippocampus, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the intricate relationship between gut microbiota, metabolites, and both PDPN and cognitive dysfunc- tion in / mice. It also provides insights into potential mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of these comorbidities, suggesting that modulation of the gut microbiota and its metabolites may offer new therapeutic strategies.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most frequent chronic complication of diabetes. Diabetes duration and poor glycaemic control, among others, are risk factors for DPN, yet they do not fully account for the individual differences in the risk of develop- ing DPN. Therefore, it has been postulated that genetic factors may contribute to DPN susceptibility, however, very few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have explored this hypothesis. We have performed a GWAS meta-analysis of European ancestry individuals with diabetes with the aim of identifying genetic factors underlying DPN susceptibility.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed a GWAS meta-analysis on 11,377 individuals with diabetes and DPN and 106,817 controls with diabetes without DPN. The analysis included: (1) a GWAS meta- analysis from UK Biobank (2,306 cases and 34,176 controls), (2) a DPN GWAS from FinnGen (1,765 cases and 63,807 controls) and, (3) a GWAS meta-analysis of four independent cohorts (7,306 cases and 8,834 controls): GoDARTS-SHARE, DOLCE, AfterEU and DiaGENES. SNP-based heritability was estimated using raw geno- type data from UK Biobank. The replication of five variants previously associated with DPN was evaluated. Genetic correlation analyses with metabolic, neurologic and cardiovascular traits were conducted.

**Results:**
We estimated that common SNPs account for 13% (SE 0.08) of the heritability of the DPN in the context of diabetes (including type 1 and type 2 diabetes). Meta-analysis revealed a locus in chromosome 1 reaching genome-wide significance (lead SNP rs2093787, OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.47-2.26, = 3.80x10 ). The signal is located in a highly con- served intergenic region (Vertebrate PhastCons 30-way 0.82) lacking functional annotations and its closest gene is a long non-coding RNA expressed in the testis, . Four additional loci showed sug- gestive significance ( < ­1x10 ) and their effect on DPN was direction- ally consistent across studies. Previously reported GWAS loci associ- ated with DPN did not replicate in our study ( > 0.001). Genetic correlation analyses are ongoing.

**Conclusion:**
In the largest to-date GWAS meta-analysis of DPN we have identified a novel genetic association with DPN in Euro- pean ancestry individuals with diabetes. Further efforts are needed to replicate and validate these findings. These results may contribute to expanding our knowledge about a poorly understood but frequent diabetes complication.

**Background and aims:**
Exercise enhances insulin sensitivity to levels far greater than any known drug - an effect centred to the prior exercising muscles. Uncovering the underlying mechanisms may present fascinating new drug targets. We recently developed the personalized phosphoproteomics workflow to provide an unbiased molecular description of physiological outcome. Using this method, we predicted a central role of mTORC1 in mediating the insulin- sensitizing effect of exercise. Here, we aim to establish a causal relationship of mTORC1 signalling to insulin stimulated glucose uptake in human skeletal muscle using the mTORC1-specific inhibi- tor rapamycin.

**Materials and methods:**
In a crossover blinded study, 13 healthy (age 28±4 yrs, BMI 22±2, ­VO -max 50±7 ml/kg/min) men were recruited. Each study day consisted of a single treatment of either rapamycin (0.21 mg/kg) or placebo followed by one-legged exercise (1h), a recovery period (4h) and a hyperinsulinemic (~100 μU/ml) euglycemic clamp (2h). Glucose uptake of each leg (rested control vs. exercised) was assessed by arteriovenous catheterization and muscle biopsies collected pre- and post the insulin clamp. Muscle biopsies were subsequently analysed by phosphoproteomics.

**Results:**
Rapamycin increased the effect of exercise on insulin-stim- ulated glucose uptake (AUC) in muscle by 53% (p=0.049) ( ), indicating that mTORC1 is a negative regulator of muscle insulin sen- sitivity following exercise. Interestingly, this effect of rapamycin varied widely, ranging from -40% to 218% among 13 subjects ( ). ~3% of the muscle phosphoproteome were significantly affected by rapa- mycin ( <0.05; median fold change>1.5), yet the diversity in glucose uptake were not generally reflected on the rapamycin-affected phospho- proteome. Thus, we employed personalized phosphoproteomics to link a subset of signalling to the rapamycin-affected muscle insulin sensitiv- ity. This approach pointed to the kinase MNK2 as a downstream target of mTORC1, possibly transferring the effects on muscle insulin action.

**Conclusion:**
These data expand on our previous personalized phos- phoproteomics observations and suggest a causal linkage on the asso- ciation of mTORC1 signalling to muscle insulin sensitivity. MNK2 might further regulate the effects downstream of mTORC1 and will be explored in follow-up studies using model systems.

**Background and aims:**
High intensity interval training (HIIT) improves obesity-related metabolic impairments and the time of day has been suggested to affect the metabolic adaptations to exercise. We studied if timing (AM and PM) of a HIIT program affects the training- mediated effects on peripheral insulin sensitivity, muscle oxidative capacity and intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content/composition in individu- als with overweight/obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
Twenty-five, adults with overweight and/or obesity (age: 64 ± 7 years, BMI: 31.5 ± 3.2 kg/m ) completed 12 weeks of progressive HIIT on a stationary bike, by choice either in the morn- ing (08.00h-11.00h) (HIIT/AM) or in the afternoon (14.30h-18.00h) (HIIT/PM). Before and after the HIIT program, peripheral insulin sen- sitivity was assessed by a 2-step hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamp (10-40 mU). Muscle biopsies were obtained >48<72 hours after the final exercise session. Muscle oxidative capacity (PCr recovery half- time by P-MRS, citrate synthase activity (CS) and OxPHOS complex protein content) and IHL content and composition ( H-MRS) were measured. Whole-body maximal oxidative capacity ­(VO max) was assessed via a progressive exercise test on a cycle ergometer.

**Results:**
At baseline, HIIT/AM and HIIT/PM groups were comparable in all study parameters. VO2max improved similarly in the HIIT/AM (Δ+1.9 ± 0.6 ml/kg/min) and HIIT/PM group (Δ+2.4 ± 0.6 ml/kg/ min) upon training. Peripheral insulin sensitivity (ΔRd), was signifi- cantly affected by timing of exercise (P = 0.03) with greater ΔRd in the HIIT/PM group (Δ+7.1 ± 1.8 μmol/kg/min) compared to HIIT/ AM group (Δ+1.4 ± 1.8 μmol/kg/min). Skeletal muscle OxPHOS protein levels and CS activity were significantly affected by timing of exercise, with greater HIIT-mediated increase of OxPHOS proteins complex I, III , IV and CS activity (all P < 0.05) in the HIIT/AM group (CI: Δ+0.9 ± 0.1 A.U, CIII: Δ+0.4 ± 0.1 A.U, CIV: Δ+0.5 ± 0.09 A.U and CS: Δ+61 ± 12 μmol/min/g) compared to HIIT/PM group (CI: Δ+0.3 ± 0.1 A.U, CIII: Δ+0.1 ± 0.1 A.U, CIV: Δ+0.2 ± 0.08 A.U and CS: Δ+19 ± 15 μmol/min/g). HIIT-mediated decreases on PCr recovery half-time were significantly larger (P = 0.03) in the HIIT/AM group (Δ-8.3 ± 1.6 s) compared to HIIT/PM group (Δ-3.1 ±1.5 s). HIIT-mediated changes on intrahepatic lipid composition, but not intrahepatic lipid content, were significantly affected by timing of exercise, with a greater reduction (P = 0.04) of the saturated fatty acid (SFA) fraction in the HIIT/PM compared to HIIT/AM group.

**Conclusion:**
Twelve weeks of HIIT performed in the afternoon pro- motes greater insulin sensitizing benefits compared to training in the morning, while morning HIIT promotes greater muscle mitochondrial adaptations. Thus, timing of exercise differentially affects the metabolic health benefits of HIIT in metabolically compromised individuals.

**Type 2 diabetes is associated with lower oxygen uptake and meta- bolic inflexibility during exercise in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction**

L. Nesti, L. Sacchetta, D. Tricò, A. Natali

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with worse outcomes in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We investigated the effect of T2D on oxygen uptake and on fuel selection and oxidation during progressive exercise test in a case-control study.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed 112 patients with HFpEF, of which 56 patients with T2D and 56 with normal glucose tolerance matched by age, sex, BMI and heart failure stage, undergoing a maxi- mal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) with concomitant cardiac ultrasound. We applied indirect calorimetry to breath-by-breath gas exchange to estimate lipid and carbohydrate oxidation rates during progressive exercise.

**Results:**
Patients with T2D displayed reduced oxygen uptake at peak exercise by 9% with respect to controls ­(VO 12.5±2.9 13.8±3.5 mL•min •kg ; p=0.0306), despite identical breathing responses and hemodynamics (all p>0.05). Patients with T2D displayed lower maximal fat oxidation rates (MFO) (0.16±0.07 0.19±0.08 g•min ; p=0.0404) during low-to-moderate exercise and an early crossover of carbohydrate over lipid oxidation (47±12 52±12 %VO , p=0.0204). We found a strong direct linear relationship between MFO and ­VO (p<0.0001) as well as between the exercise intensity trig- gering the crossover and ­VO (p=0.0011).

**Conclusion:**
In HFpEF, T2D is associated with a significant reduction in oxygen uptake and metabolic inflexibility characterized by low rates of fat oxidation and an early reliance on carbohydrates, suggesting a metabolic/mitochondrial contribution to reduced exercise capacity in this population.

3. Diagnostics International, Basel, Switzerland, Roche Diabetes Care

**Background and aims:**
Exercise is recommended for people with diabetes, but the effects of different exercise types on immediate and extended (24-hours after exercise) glycemia remain debated. This study analyzes continuous glucose data from mySugr® and Apple Health® users to assess how exercise types (Walking, Aerobic excl. Walking and Anaerobic) affect glycemia upon commencement of exercise, and 24 hours after exercise, in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Materials and methods:**
Exercise events (516,962) from 4,417 users (3,248 type 1; 1,169 type 2) with a minimum of 5 exercise logs and >90% CGM wear time were categorized into 3 types. Two-hour post- exercise minimums and the mean changes of proportions of time in- (TIR) and out of range were compared 24 hours after commencement of exercise and during sedentary days across exercise- and diabetes types. T-tests were used to compare immediate and extended effects across exercise types.

**Results:**
All exercise types decreased immediate glycemia in both type 1 (-22.38 mg/dL, -25.90 mg/dL and -9.42 mg/dL for Walking, Aerobic and Anaerobic respectively, all p<0.001) and type 2 diabetes (-14.37 mg/dL, -15.44 mg/dL and -2.17 mg/dL; all p<0.001) and improved TIR 24 hours after exercise as compared to sedentary days (type 1: +2.49%, +3.39% and +4.37% across exercise types; type 2: +2.62%, +3.74%, +4.7%; all p<0.001). Among type 1 participants, all exercise types significantly increased hypoglycemia risk across 24 hours after exercise (+0.34%, +0.68%, +0.63%; all p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Exercise types modulate glycemia differently over imme- diate and extended periods, but similarly across diabetes types. In both diabetes types, aerobic forms of exercise caused a larger immediate decrease of glycemia, while anaerobic caused a larger improvement of TIR 24-hour after exercise.The large dataset from this real-world study supports generalizability and practical interpretability of the findings of how different exercise types modulate glycemia for people with type 1 and type 2 patients.

**Sex-specific exercise adaptations in hippocampal energy metabo- lism: a multi-proteomic analysis in mice**

K.J. Sevits

1. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA, AdventHealth, Orlando, FL,

**Background and aims:**
Exercise improves insulin sensitivity and mito- chondrial function both in skeletal muscle and in tissues beyond the locomotor system, including the brain. Nonetheless, it remains to be determined whether the brain health benefits of exercise are related to molecular changes involving energy metabolism. The hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory with abundant insulin recep- tors (IRS-1 and IRS-2), is likely responsive to exercise-induced meta- bolic adaptations. Here we examined the impact of aerobic exercise on hippocampal energy metabolism through comprehensive analysis of enzymatic activities, proteome composition, and post-translational modifications (PTM) in both males and females.

**Materials and methods:**
Two groups of C57BL/6J mice (n=8/group, 4 males and 4 females) were individually housed with either free access to running wheels for 6 weeks or maintained in sedentary conditions. Voluntary running activity was quantified using wheel rotation coun- ters. Hippocampal tissue was assayed for amounts of NAD+/NADH and enzymatic activities of citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome oxidase (COx), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In addition, changes to the global proteome, acetylproteome, and phosphoproteome were identified via LC-MS/MS. Differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using Reactome pathways were performed (p<0.05, FDR<0.05).

**Results:**
Exercise trained mice exhibited higher CS (+65%, p<0.01) and COx (+22%, p=0.078) activities and lower LDH activity (-40%, p<0.001), reflecting a metabolic shift toward oxidative metabolism. Concurrently, there were 63 hippocampal proteins in females and 2465 in males that were significantly greater in the exercise group (FDR<0.05). GSEA revealed significant enrichment of the aerobic respiration and res- piratory electron transport pathway in females (NES=1.81, FDR=0.01) but not males. For multiple mitochondrial components, analysis of pro- teins showed sex-specific intensity changes, often in opposing directions (p<0.05). Female mice showed coordinated directional regulation of electron transport chain components spanning all five complexes, includ- ing Ndufa1, Ndufb2 (Complex I), Sdhc (Complex II), Uqcr10 (Complex III), Cox6a (Complex IV), and Atp5f1 (Complex V). Similarly, acetyl- proteome analysis captured enrichment of aerobic respiration pathways in females (NES=1.63, p=0.021), with Cs displaying significant post- translational modification in males and females but in opposite directions. Phosphoproteome analysis revealed broader changes (104 sites in females, 519 in males, FDR<0.05), but lacked pathway enrichment, suggesting more dispersed regulation. Metabolite analysis revealed differences in hippocampal NAD+ levels, consistent with protein acetylation patterns, as NAD+ serves as an essential cofactor for sirtuin deacetylases important for regulating mitochondrial function.

**Conclusion:**
Exercise training induces sex-specific adaptations in hip- pocampal energy metabolism, particularly enhancing aerobic respiration pathways in females through coordinated changes in protein expression and acetylation. These findings open new avenues for understanding the sexual dimorphism in how exercise can reshape brain energy metabolism and potentially contribute to sex differences in exercise-mediated neuro- protection and improved cognition.

**Impaired lipid oxidation during exercise in type 2 diabetes and its role in exercise intolerance: a case-control study**

L. Santoni, Chiriacò, L. Sacchetta, D. Trico, A. Natali

**Background and aims:**
Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) suffer from effort intolerance and reduced oxygen uptake that are not fully explained by cardiopulmonary capacity. We investigated the effect of T2D on fuel selection and oxidation during progressive exercise.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed 95 patients with T2D and 95 con- trols matched by age, sex, and lean body weight with normal glucose tolerance undergoing a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) with concomitant cardiac ultrasound. We applied indirect calorimetry to breath-by-breath gas exchange to estimate lipid and carbohydrate oxida- tion rates during progressive exercise.

**Results:**
Patients with T2D displayed reduced oxygen uptake at peak exercise by 17% ­(VO 18.25 ± 4.11 21.92 ± 8.48 mg/kg/min; p < 0.001) with respect to controls, despite identical breathing responses and hemodynamics. Patients with T2D showed impaired peripheral oxy- gen uptake during exercise (artero-venous oxygen difference 11.77 ± 3.04 13.00 ±4.14 mL/dL; p = 0.028) and lower absolute and relative rates of lipid oxidation (FATox) throughout the test (p < 0.005) with reduced maximal fat oxidation rate (MFO) normalized for fat free mass (4.44 ± 1.30 5.35 ± 2.23 mg/min/Kg; p < 0.001), while carbohydrate oxidation rates (CHOox) were superimposable (p > 0.05) ( ). We found a strong direct linear relationship between MFO and ­VO ­(r = 0.34, p < 0.0001). The increase in ­VO was directly correlated with artero-venous oxygen difference at peak in the control group ­(r =0.20, p < 0.0001), while the correlation was absent in the T2D group.

**Conclusion:**
Patients with T2D display a significant reduction in oxygen uptake associated with defective peripheral oxygen extraction and muscu- lar fat oxidation, suggesting that a metabolic mitochondrial defect might contribute to effort intolerance in this population.

**Background and aims:**
All forms of diabetes mellitus are character- ized by defective pancreatic β-cell function. In response to elevated glucose concentrations, spatially-organized ­Ca waves are observed between beta cells within the islet and these become defective in type 2 diabetes. While “Leader” β-cells initiate ­Ca waves, “hubs” underlie an islet-wide functional network. At present it is not clear if these functional subpopulations are stable over time, nor whether they display different levels of sensitivity to metabolic stress. Moreo- ver, the impact of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor ago- nism on islet-wide beta cell ­Ca dynamics remain largely unknown.

**Materials and methods:**
We engrafted islets from C57BL6 Ins1Cre. GCaMP6f mice expressing the genetically-encoded ­Ca indica- tor GCaMP6f into the anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) of con- trol, high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) diet or genetically-induced hyperglycemic mice lacking a single glucokinase allele: C57BL6/J- ; . After engraftment and diet treatment (21 weeks), we recorded islet-wide ­Ca dynamics in 2D and 3D with cellular resolution through the cornea of anesthetized animals at day 0, 1 and 7. Spontaneous photoactivation of the fluorescent protein PA- mCherry, introduced using an adenoviral vector, permitted repeated functional assessments of the same individual cells in sequential imag- ing sessions.

**Results:**
We explored leader and hub subpopulation stability over time, and their sensitivity to hyperglycemia and GLP1R agonism . Under control group, highly coordinated ­Ca waves routinely emanated from “leader” β-cells at the islet periphery. In these condi- tions leader and hub remained stable for > 7 days. However, islets engrafted into HFHS diet animals or mice heterozygous for a hypo- morphic allele displayed lower connectivity (0.89 in control vs 0.61 HFHS vs 0.59 , respectively), characterized by incom- plete and defective ­Ca wave propagation: indicating that leader are more resilient to metabolic stress than hubs cell. Critically, acute intraperitoneal injection of exendin-4 (Ex-4, 1 nmol/kg) at day 8 restored islet ­Ca dynamics in HFHS and animals (Ctrl+PBS vs Ctrl+Ex-4 not significant, n=4, HFD+PBS vs HFD+Ext-4 p=0.013, n=7, +PBS vs +Ext-4, p=0.016, n=5). Notably, Ex-4 reengaged a “hub” cells, restoring beta cell-beta cell connectivity and ­Ca dynamics.

**Conclusion:**
By developing an approach to follow the activity of indi- vidual beta cells prospectively over time in the living animal we show that leader and hub subpopulations are functionally stable subpopula- tions . Hyperglycemia disconnected islet-wide functional net- work by disturbing primarily the hub beta-cells . This effect was reversed acutely by GLP1R agonism, likely contributing to improved insulin secretion.

**Background and aims:**
The precise role of non β cells in modulating β cell function during meals remains unclear. To elucidate this, we have combined, in a hybrid / approach, an inducible transgenic model of non β cell ablation, a non-invasive microfluidic islets-on-chip, and multi-organ modelling in human. Our objectives were to (i) characterize in mice the role of non β cells on glu- cose homeostasis during glucose ± amino acid mix (AAM) tests, (ii) apply meal-like protocols on-chip to quantify real-time β cell collective activity, (iii) elaborate dynamic mathematical models of islets from on-chip data, and (iv) integrate these models into the FDA-approved UVA-PADOVA human multi-organ simulator of glucose homeostasis.

**Materials and methods:**
Control and diphtheria toxin-inducible tri- ple transgenic mice lacking non β cells (only-β) were submitted to ip tolerance tests. Their islets were cultured and recorded in microfluidic microelectrode array chips with 2 parallel chambers for comparisons. Python-programmed mathematical models obtained from β cell electric slow potentials (SP) recorded on-chip were generated and incorporated into the human subjects of the UVA-PADOVA simulator.

**Results:**
Tolerance tests in mice showed that non β cell ablation alters glycaemia and insulin levels after glucose and AAM adminis- tration (p<0.05, N=14-16). A 120-min meal-like protocol of glucose (4-12 mM) ± AAM (1.5-5.5 mM) increase and decrease was applied on islets-on-chips. AAM, compared to glucose alone, enhanced β cell activity in control (SP frequency 0.38±0.08 to 0.50±0.08 Hz; p<0.0001; N=4; 25 islets) and in a lesser extent in only-β islets (0.43±0.07 to 0.50±0.11 Hz; p<0.05; N=4; 27 islets). Furthermore, AAM significantly reduced β cell synchrony (SP amplitude 35.2±3.9 to 28.5±2.0 μV; p<0.01) with a more pronounced desynchronising effect in only-β islets (43.8±5.3 to 23.4±2.7 μV; p<0.005). The SP frequencies obtained from these meal-on-chip data were used to gen- erate mathematical models of islets activation and inactivation utiliz- ing Hill functions. These models show that, in control islets, glucose sensitivity was lower during glucose increase than decrease in absence of AAM ­(EC 8.1 vs 6.9 mM, respectively). In contrast, the sensitiv- ity pattern was reversed by AAM ­(EC 7.1 vs 8.1 mM, respectively). Moreover, non β cell ablation dramatically reduced glucose sensitiv- ity during glucose decrease in the presence of AAM ­(EC 9.5 mM). Integration of these 4 islet models into the 11 human subjects of the UVA-PADOVA simulator submitted to 48h of regular meals (3.2 g/kg CHO daily) showed no significant difference of glycaemic regulation between control and only-β models generated with on-chip stimulation with glucose alone (TIR 96.3±2.2 vs 97.4±2.1 %; p>0.1). For islet models generated with glucose and AAM, the glycaemic regulation of humans was improved with control islets (98.8±1.7 %; p<0.05, com- pared to glucose alone), but not with only-β islets in the same subjects (98.5±1.8 %; p>0.1), thus confirming in human in silico our in vivo mouse data.

**Conclusion:**
This unique combination of in vitro/in silico approach shows that amino acids significantly improve β cell sensitivity to glu- cose and glycaemic control in a multi-organ system via their action on non β cells.

**Sodium/potassium ATPase-mediated alpha-cell hyperpolarisation sustains metabolic control of glucagon secretion**

M. Dickerson, D. Jacobson

**Background and aims:**
The catalytic (NKAα1) and auxiliary (NKAβ1) subunits of the ­Na /K ATPase (NKA) protein complex are highly expressed in α-cells, yet their function is poorly understood. Given the importance of NKA to cation handling and membrane poten- tial regulation, we aimed to define the role of NKA in tuning α-cell ­Ca -handling and glucagon secretion.

**Materials and methods:**
Electrophysiology, fluorescence imaging, and hormone secretion assays were employed to study NKA subunit- specific regulation of α-cell function. This was accomplished utiliz- ing transgenic mouse lines with α-cell-specific NKAβ1 knockout (αNKAβ1KO) or conditional NKAα1 ablation (αNKAα1KO) and a genetically encoded ­Ca sensor (Salsa6f). Human pseudoislets were also employed that contained α-cell-specific NKAβ1 knockdown (αNKAβ1KD).

**Results:**
Under hyperglycemic conditions (11 mM glucose), α-cell ­Ca was elevated 110±31% in αNKAβ1KO islets compared to controls ( <0.05). During hypoglycemic stimulation (1 mM glu- cose), ­Ca increased 174±30% in control α-cells ( <0.01), but was unchanged in NKAβ1KO α-cells. In response to 1 mM glucose, glucagon secretion decreased 40±15% ( <0.01) in αNKAβ1KO mouse islets and 23±11% ( <0.05) in αNKAβ1KD human pseu- doislets. αNKAβ1KO mice were glucose intolerant (37±14% AUC increase; <0.05), with 71±12% lower plasma glucagon during an insulin tolerance test ( <0.001). Glucokinase inhibition with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), mimicking hypoglycemia , resulted in a 67±7% decrease in glucagon secretion ( <0.01) in αNKAβ1KO mice. Interestingly, α-cell stimulation by arginine injection led to an 84±4% greater increase in plasma glucagon in αNKAβ1KO mice than in control mice ( <0.05). These results suggest that NKAβ1KO α-cells have reduced glucose sensitivity and enhanced amino acid responsiveness. We next examined the effect of com- plete ablation of the catalytic NKAα1 subunit in α-cells. Following tamoxifen-induced α-cell NKAα1KO, stimulated glucagon secretion was reduced. Arginine-induced plasma glucagon responses decreased 86±4% ( <0.01), 2-DG-stimulated plasma glucagon responses diminished 56±1% (P<0.05), and insulin-mediated plasma glucagon responses declined 62±13% ( <0.01). Islets isolated from these mice seven days post-tamoxifen contained Salsa6f-positive α-cells, indicating NKAα1 ablation does not cause rapid or complete α-cell destruction. Intracellular ­Ca was elevated in NKAα1KO α-cells within isolated islets at both 11 mM glucose (155±30%; P<0.001) and 1 mM glucose (56±14%; P<0.001) and hypoglycemia- induced glucagon secretion in response to 1 mM glucose decreased 70±12% ( <0.01).

**Conclusion:**
These findings establish NKAα1 and NKAβ1 as key regulators of α-cell metabolic sensing, ­Ca handling, and glucagon secretion. The data suggest that metabolic ATP production activates NKA preventing α-cell ­Ca influx and that diminished ATP levels during hypoglycemia decreases NKA activity, which promotes α-cell ­Ca entry and glucagon secretion.

**Disrupted alpha cell function in human and murine islets devoid of other endocrine cells**

E. Bru-Tari

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic alpha-cells release glucagon to counteract hypoglycemia and suppress its secretion during hypergly- cemia. This regulation is influenced by glucose levels and paracrine signals from islet cells. In diabetes, glucagon secretion is dysregu- lated, with elevated plasma glucagon during hyperglycemia and blunted alpha-cell responses to hypoglycemia. While multiple diabetes-related factors have been linked to alpha-cell dysfunction, the exact mecha- nisms remain unclear. We aim to investigate whether dysrupted intra- islet communication drives glucagon dysregulation.

**Materials and methods:**
Monotypic pseudoislets were generated by sorting and re-aggregating purified human alpha- and beta-cells from non-diabetic islet donors. Glucagon and insulin secretion were meas- ured at physiological glucose levels from basal (5.6 mM) to either 8.6 mM or 3 mM, to mimic postprandial and hypoglycemic levels, respectively, and compared with pseudoislets containing all cell types. Plasmatic glucagon was assessed in alpha-only mice (Rip-DTR, Sst- DTR and Ppy-DTR transgenes) following diphteria toxin (DT)-induced ablation of beta-, delta- and gamma-cells (“non-alpha-cells”). After islet remodeling, glucagon was measured during hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and compared with control mice.

**Results:**
Pseudoislets made exclusively of beta-cells exhibited a glu- cose-dependent insulin secretory pattern very similar to that of pseudo- islets containing all cell types: insulin secretion was decreased at 3mM glucose and increased at 8.6mM glucose. In contrast, in absence of non-alpha-cells, alpha-cells exhibit an inverted glucagon secretory pat- tern with increased glucagon release at 8.6 mM and reduced secretion at 3 mM. Similarly, alpha-only mice show impaired glucagon suppres- sion during hyperglycemia and decreased secretion in hypoglycemia in comparison with mice whose islets are composed by all islet cells.

**Conclusion:**
Human and murine alpha-cells rely on intra-islet commu- nication for proper function. In the absence of non-alpha-cells, alpha- cells display a dysregulated secretory pattern, mirroring postprandial hyperglucagonemia and impaired alpha-cell hypoglycemic responses seen in diabetics. These findings suggest that glucagon dysregulation in diabetes stems from inadequate alpha-cell interactions within the islet and highlight islet cell communication as a potential therapeutic target for restoring alpha-cell function.

**Background and aims:**
Both α- and β-cells are dysfunctional in type 1 diabetes (T1D) but while β-cells die α-cells survive the immune attack. Recent evidence indicates that α-cells are more resistant to diabetes- related stressors compared to β-cells. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we analysed our own and publicly available human sin- gle-cell transcriptomes from α-/β-cells exposed to T1D conditions and we identified and tested a new gene that may convey β-cell susceptibil- ity based on 1) its differential expression in α- vs β-cells and 2) its role in apoptosis, a cellular process relevant in T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Differential gene expression analysis in α- vs β-cells was performed using single-cell transcriptomic data- sets from individuals with T1D and from studies of human islets exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines. For validation experi- ments, EndoC-βH1 cells were transfected with a siRNA specific for the selected gene or scrambled negative control and treated or not for 48h with the mix of IFNγ (1000 U/mL) +IL1β (50 U/mL). During aggregation, primary human islet microtissues (hIsMTs) were trans- duced with AAVs encoding a shRNA specific for the selected gene or scrambled negative control. HIsMTs were then treated with solvent control or a mix of TNFα (25 ng/mL) +IL1β (5 ng/mL) +IFNγ (25 ng/mL) +IFNα (10ng/mL) for 6 days. Gene and protein expression were analyzed by RT-qPCR, immunoblot or 3D staining and imaging. Apoptosis was evaluated by 1) counting apoptotic cells after staining with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 and 2) analyzing Caspase 3/7 activity by ELISA. Insulin secretion was performed in hIsMTs cultured sequentially in Kreb’s Ringer Hepes Buffer containing 2.8 mM and 16.7 mM glucose for 2h followed by tissue lysis for the assessment of total insulin content. Basal and stimulated insulin secretion as well as intracellular insulin were then quantified by ELISA. Results are means of 3-6 experiments, analyzed by ANOVA.

**Results:**
Based on the extensive bioinformatic analysis described above, we selected for further study the tumour suppressor Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3), involved in apoptosis induction in differ- ent cancer contexts and with a 37-fold higher expression in β- com- pared to α-cells (P<0.0001). To date, MEG3 has not been evaluated in models of human T1D. MEG3 knockdown (KD) in EndoC-βH1 cells decreased β-cell apoptosis (20%, P<0.01), expression (49% decrease, P<0.0001) and secretion (12% decrease, P<0.05) and STAT1 phosphorylation induced by IFNγ+IL1β (46% decrease, P<0.05). In hIsMTs, MEG3 KD decreased by 29% (P<0.01) β-cell apoptosis and expression (25% decrease, P<0.07). Additionally, in these cells MEG3 KD increased both basal (104% increase, P<0.05) and glucose-stimulated (77% increase, P<0.05) insulin secretion and decreased HLA-ABC cell surface expression (21% decrease, P<0.01) following cytokine exposure.

**Conclusion:**
The fact that expression of MEG3 is higher in β- com- pared to α-cells could explain, at least in part, why β-cells are more susceptible to damage and cell death in a diabetogenic environment. Decreasing MEG3 expression in β-cells could provide a therapeutic approach to protect cells from the immune attack and support β-cell function.

**Endocrine-vascular coupling in the pancreatic islet and its impact on blood flow**

L. Mateus Goncalves

**Background and aims:**
Islets are small endocrine organs scattered throughout the exocrine pancreas. Although both endocrine and exo- crine pancreatic tissues share their vascular networks, a selective increase in islet blood flow is observed upon increases in glycemia - a vascular response known as functional hyperemia. We have previously shown that pericytes participate in functional hyperemic responses in islets, and that these acute changes in islet blood flow are needed for a proper hormonal response to a glucose challenge. However, how islet vascular responses to glucose are orchestrated, which cellular elements and signaling mechanisms enable them have not been fully character- ized. In this study, we hypothesized that beta cells control islet blood flow by releasing different vasoactive molecules which act on pericytes.

**Materials and methods:**
To acutely manipulate beta cell activity, we injected adeno-associated viruses encoding excitatory (M3) and inhibitory (M4) designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) under the insulin promoter into mice that express GCaMP3 in pericytes. We monitored pericyte activity in living pancreas slices and islet blood flow in the exteriorized mouse pancreas.

**Results:**
We found that the DREADD agonist clozapine (CNO; applied acutely for 5-10 min) induced a decrease in ­[Ca ]i in islet pericytes and , and increased islet blood flow in the exteriorized pancreas of mice expressing M3-DREADD (excitatory) receptors in beta cells. In contrast, inhibiting beta cells, by applying CNO to slices produced from M4-DREADD expressing mice, increased ­[Ca ]i in a subset of islet pericytes. Manipulating the endogenous levels and recep- tor signaling of potential vasoactive molecules released by beta cells (adenosine, serotonin and insulin) altered pericyte ­[Ca ]i responses to beta cell activation with CNO.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, our data show that beta cells participate in the acute regulation of islet blood flow. By releasing vasoactive fac- tors, beta cell activation decreases islet pericyte activity which results in capillary dilation and increased islet blood flow. We therefore think that endocrine-vascular coupling mechanisms are present in islets and mediate functional hyperemic responses. This increase in islet blood flow upon beta cell activation would enable a sustained supply of nutri- ents and oxygen to beta cells in periods of heightened metabolic activ- ity as upon stimulation with glucose.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes distress is common among people with diabetes and is associated with poor glycaemic control and well- being. The 20-item Problem Areas in Diabetes scale (PAID-20) is a widely used measure of diabetes distress. However, there is limited empirical evidence from large cohorts of adults with type 1 diabetes regarding the establishment of thresholds to identify clinically relevant distress. Therefore, we aimed to determine appropriate thresholds for the PAID-20 to guide research and clinical practice.

**Materials and methods:**
The study comprised 9,946 individuals with type 1 diabetes recruited from the population-based Norwegian Dia- betes Register for Adults. We performed a hierarchical cluster analysis to identify clusters of individuals with diabetes distress and to derive preliminary PAID-20 thresholds within the 0-100 total score. We fur- ther applied segmented regression analyses to 1) examine associations between PAID-20 and both HbA1c and general well-being (WHO-5 well-being index scores) and 2) investigate whether the breakpoints identified in segmented regression analysis aligned with the thresholds derived from the cluster analysis.

**Results:**
The cluster analysis identified three distinct distress clusters, which led to the definition of preliminary PAID-20 score thresholds at 0-22, 23-46, and 47-100. In the segmented regression analyses, we identified breakpoints at PAID-20 values of 23.3 (95% CI 12.9, 33.7) for HbA1c and 39.3 (95% CI 33.3. 45.2) for WHO-5 scores. Based on these findings, we categorised the PAID-20 score thresholds into three levels: 0-24 as low distress (n= 5,402 [54.3%]), 25-39 as moderate distress (n= 2,392 [24.1%]) and 40-100 as high (clinically relevant) distress (n= 2,152 [21.6%]).

**Conclusion:**
The results demonstrated a clear alignment between the PAID-20 thresholds identified through cluster analysis and the break- points established in segmented regression analyses. Individuals with type 1 diabetes appeared to fall into three distinct groups, each repre- senting varying levels of diabetes distress: low, moderate, and high.

**Feelings of guilt as a central trigger of diabetes distress in the daily lives of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: analysis of a dynamic, temporal network**

D. Ehrmann

**Background and aims:**
Elevated diabetes distress is one of the most common psychosocial issues in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Little is known about the precipitating factors of diabetes distress, and about key stressors in the daily lives of people with diabetes. The aim of this analysis was to identify key stressors in everyday life and to investigate which stressors can trigger other stressors.

**Materials and methods:**
Nine specific aspects of diabetes distress were recorded daily over 17 days using Ecological Momentary Assess- ment: (1) Feelings of guilt of neglecting diabetes (2) Feeling restricted (3) Feeling overwhelmed (4) Feeling left alone (5) Diabetes taking up too much physical and mental energy (6) Hypoglycaemia burden (7) Hyperglycaemia burden (8) Glucose variability burden (9) Burden from glucose alarms. Using multilevel vector autoregression, a dynamic, temporal network of the 9 stress aspects was calculated. This network analysed the extent to which a stressor on day ‘t’ predicts the other stressors on the following day ‘t+1’, controlled for all other stressors. For each stressor, a measure was calculated of the extent to which this stressor predicts all other stressors (outStrength: sum of all outgoing coefficients); thus, can therefore trigger other stresses. In addition, the extent to which each stressor is predicted by all other stressors was cal- culated (inStrength: sum of all incoming coefficients); in other words, to what extend it is triggered by other stressors.

**Results:**
Data from 274 people with diabetes were analysed (45% type 2 diabetes, 100% CGM). ‘Feeling guilty about neglecting diabetes’ had the greatest predictive power (outStrength: 0.34), followed by ‘burden of hyperglycaemia’ (0.24). ‘Diabetes taking up too much energy” had the greatest inStrength (0.24), followed by ‘Guilt’ (0.22). More feel- ings of guilt on day ‘t’ predicted significantly higher levels of hyper- glycaemia burden (β=0.05, p=0.02), feelings of being overwhelmed (β=0.07, p=0.001), feelings of being left alone (β=0.06, p=0.006) and diabetes taking up too much energy (β=0.06, p=0.011) on the fol- lowing day ‘t+1’. Conversely, greater hypoglycaemia burden on day ‘t’ significantly predicted feelings of guilt on the following day ‘t+1’ (β=0.04, p=0.04).

**Conclusion:**
Feelings of guilt for neglecting diabetes were of central importance within a network of diabetes-related stressors, as they can trigger a cascade of further stressors on subsequent days. Conversely, the feeling that diabetes is taking up too much energy is particularly susceptible to stress from other aspects. The temporal network allows the identification of central daily hassles and shows that feelings of guilt could be a potential starting point for interventions to reduce diabetes distress.

1. Imperial College London, London, UK, University College London,

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes stigma (T1DS) refers to the negative social judgements toward people living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and is linked to poorer psychological well-being and suboptimal diabetes self-management. This qualitative study explored the T1DS experiences of adults living with T1D in the UK to inform targeted interventions.

**Materials and methods:**
UK-based adults (aged ≥18 years) with T1D were eligible to participate. Participants completed an online survey as part of a wider study: T1D-Stigma. The study was advertised on social media. In addition, invitations were sent to eligible candidates who consented to be contacted about future research studies either in the After Diabetes Diagnosis REsearch Support System (ADDRESS-2) or from previous participation in T1D research at Imperial College London. The survey included the Type 1 diabetes stigma assessment scale (DSAS-1). Any respondent who endorsed at least one item on the DSAS-1 was then invited to provide a response (no character limit) to the following question: “Tell us more about the different range of experiences, beliefs or actions that you experience as particularly stig- matising: What have you experienced or observed? How did this affect you? Did it change how you view things or yourself, the things you do or used to do, or your relationships?” Responses were analysed using thematic analysis.

**Results:**
N=416 participated (8.9% response rate for the N=4354 invited). 96% (N=398) of the sample endorsed 1 or more items on the DSAS-1 Of the N=398, N=321 meaningfully responded to the question (responses of ≥3 words). The median age of the sample was 42 years (IQR = 32-55 years), and BMI was 25 (IQR = 22.6- 28.7). The majority of participants were white (91.6%; N=381), female (60%; N=248), university-educated (70.2%; N=292), and lived in less deprived postcodes ­(IMD 7; IQR= 4-9). The median age at diagnosis was 26 years (IQR=14-39), and diabetes duration was 10 years (IQR=6-25 years). The median HbA1c was 52 mmol/mol (IQR=45-58), with time in range of 74% (IQR=60- 85). 12% (N=50) reported experiencing an episode of severe hypo- glycemia in the last year. The majority of participants delivered insulin using multiple daily injections (54.6%; N=227) and used continuous glucose monitoring (93.7%; N=390). A thematic analy- sis developed four superordinate themes and 11 subthemes. The first theme explored the ‘ ’ of T1DS, which comprised ‘places’ and ‘maintaining factors’. The second theme encapsulated the ‘ ’ of T1DS’; participants described ‘unsolicited comments and advice’, ‘discrimination/rejection’ and ‘lack of understanding’. The third theme encompassed the ‘ ’ of T1DS: participants described its ‘social’, ‘emotional’ and ‘behav- ioural’ impact. The final theme explored ’ and describes participants’ ‘coping strategies’, ‘change over time’ and ‘protective factors’.

**Conclusion:**
This study has provided the first systematic qualita- tive analysis of T1DS in the UK. The majority of respondents (96%) endorsed experiencing at least one instance of perceived or experienced stigma, and in line with other health-related stigma research, T1DS was broad in its manifestations and impact. Participants volunteered information about ‘what helps’ to deal with T1DS, despite not being explicitly asked about this, highlighting approaches that could inform future interventions.

**Background and aims:**
People with type 1 diabetes (PwT1D) face a complex and multidimensional burden that can affect their care and quality of life. Using network analysis, which takes a holistic approach, we aimed to decipher which psychosocial burden dimensions are the most central and, thus, critical to prioritise to improve the overall health of PwT1D.

**Materials and methods:**
We used data from participants in the SFDT1 cohort study, enrolled between June 2020 and February 2024. We per- formed a network analysis describing their psychosocial burden using information about diabetes distress, fear of hypoglycaemia, quality of life, the burden of treatment and the impact of diabetes on education and work. We assessed the network’s stability and the variables’ cen- trality (expected influence, strength, closeness, and betweenness) and clustered them into domains and syndromes.

**Results:**
We included 1,430 participants (52% women, median age (IQR): 41 (IQR 31; 52.8) years). The network was highly stable (correlation stability coefficient = 0.75). We observed nine domains within the network: "Loneliness, Worrying & Burnout" had the highest expected influence, strength, and betweenness. “Constraints, medica- tions & controls” had the highest closeness. We further grouped the domains into three distinct syndromes labelled "Diabetes Distress", "Treatment Burden", and "Impact of Diabetes on Life." These syn- dromes reflect the most relevant pillars of the psychosocial burden in PwT1D (Figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
We observed that “Loneliness, Worrying, & burnout” is the most influential psychosocial burden domain to prioritise for T1D care. This network-based approach opens a path to personalised interventions targeting the most critical psychosocial parameters, thus expecting the most significant impact on PwT1D’s health.

**Background and aims:**
Individuals with type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk of depression and impaired health-related quality of life. While physical activity is known to improve both glycaemic con- trol and overall quality of life, the bidirectional relationship between physical activity and health-related quality of life remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the longitudinal and bidirectional associa- tions between objectively measured physical activity and health-related quality of life in individuals recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included patients from a multi- center, prospective, controlled intervention study of individuals with type 2 diabetes. We included 972 participants with at least one valid registration of physical activity and valid health-related quality of life questionnaire at either baseline, 24 months, or 48 months. Moderate- to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was objectively assessed using two tri-axial accelerometers (Axivity AX3, Newcastle). Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), which includes both a physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). A three-wave cross- lagged panel model was employed to assess the bidirectional associa- tions between physical activity and health-related quality of life, with cross-lagged effects categorised as small (β = 0.03), medium (β = 0.07), and large (β = 0.12). Both models were adjusted for age and sex.

**Results:**
PCS at baseline predicted MVPA at 24 months (β = 0.124, p < 0.001), and PCS at 24 months predicted MVPA at 48 months (β = 0.146, p < 0.001), reflecting large cross-lagged effects on MVPA. Similarly, MCS at baseline predicted MVPA at 24 months (β = 0.116, p = 0.001), reflecting a large cross-lagged effect on MVPA, but MCS at 24 months did not predict MVPA at 48 months (β = -0.016, p = 0.653). Likewise, MVPA at baseline did not predict PCS at 24 months (β = 0.038, p = 0.184); however, MVPA at 24 months significantly predicted PCS at 48 months (β = 0.065, p = 0.024). In contrast, MVPA did not predict subsequent MCS at any time point.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that both the PCS and MCS of health-related quality of life play a critical role in predicting physical activity engagement over time, whereas the influence of physical activ- ity on future MCS of health-related quality of life was less pronounced. Thus, the expected bidirectional relationship was only partially con- firmed. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of con- sidering early psychological well-being interventions in individuals with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes to enhance long-term physical activity adherence and overall disease management.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes stigma (T1DS) is the negative social judgements towards people living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and is linked to poorer psychological well-being and suboptimal diabetes self-management. This study explored sociodemographic, diabetes- health and wellbeing factors linked to high stigma scores in order to inform targeted interventions.

**Materials and methods:**
UK-based adults (aged ≥18 years) with T1D were eligible to participate. The study was advertised on social media. In addition, invitations were sent to eligible candidates who consented to be contacted about future research studies either in the After Dia- betes Diagnosis REsearch Support System (ADDRESS-2) or from previous participation in T1D research at Imperial College London. The online survey included sociodemographic and diabetes-health questions, as well as well-being measures for anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale: GAD-7), diabetes impact (Impact of Diabetes Profile: DIDP), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire: PHQ-9). It also included the Type 1 Diabetes Stigma Assessment Scale (DSAS- 1), a 19-item self-report measure where higher scores indicate more frequent encounters with T1DS. Univariate regression analyses were used to identify significant relationships between sociodemographic, diabetes-health and well-being factors and DSAS-1 score (p≤0.05). A multiple linear regression tested whether these factors were associated with DSAS-1 scores.

**Results:**
N=416 participated (8.9% response rate for the N=4354 invited). 96% (N=398) of the sample endorsed 1 or more items on the DSAS-1 The median age of the sample was 42 years (IQR = 32-55 years), and BMI was 25 (IQR = 22.6-28.7). The majority of participants were white (91.6%; N=381), female (60%; N=248), uni- versity-educated (70.2%; N=292), and lived in less deprived postcodes ­(IMD 7; IQR= 4-9). The median age at diagnosis was 26 years (IQR=14-39), and diabetes duration was 10 years (IQR=6-25 years). The median HbA1c level was 52 mmol/mol (IQR=45-58), with time in range of 74% (IQR=60-85). 12% (N=50) reported experiencing an episode of severe hypoglycemia in the last year. The majority of participants delivered insulin using multiple daily injections (54.6%; N=227) and use continuous glucose monitoring (93.7%; N=390). In multiple variable analysis, age significantly predicted DSAS-1 score (β=-0.138, p=0.006), as did female sex ( β=0.112, p =0.008), BMI (β=0.090, p=0.034), insulin pump use (β=-0.121, p=0.008), DIDP score (β=0.219, p=<.001), GAD-7 score (β=-0.181, p=0.004), PHQ-9 score (β=.203, p=0.002). Ethnicity did not significantly predict DSAS-1 score, nor did age at diagnosis or number of severe hypogly- cemia episodes.

**Conclusion:**
Most participants reported at least one instance of T1DS. High DSAS-1 scores in the UK were predicted by: younger age, female sex, higher BMI, insulin pump use, higher diabetes impact, anxiety and depression scores. Future studies should focus on individuals from these groups to explore the impact of T1DS and to tailor appropriate interventions.

**Background and aims:**
Inflammation and fibrosis represent pivotal pathological processes in diabetic nephropathy (DN), yet the underly- ing molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8), an important regulator of glucose and lipoprotein metab- olism, was recently shown to be associated with renal dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate a novel role and mechanism of ANGPTL8 in DN progression.

**Materials and methods:**
The expression of ANGPTL8 in the kid- ney was measured in patients with DN by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, and in murine models with DN by RT-qPCR, Western blots, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Proximal tubule- specific knockout mice were generated and subjected to high- fat diet plus streptozotocin treatment to induce DN, followed by renal function measurements including serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR). His- tological staining, RT-qPCR, and Western blots were performed on renal tissues to observe the pathological changes in renal tubule. For studies, human proximal tubular epithelial cells were exposed to high glucose plus palmitic acid (HGPA) to elucidate the effect of ANGPTL8 in DN and to explore the underlying mechanisms.

**Results:**
ANGPTL8 expression was significantly increased in the renal proximal tubules of both patients and murine models with DN. Proximal tubule-specific knockout ameliorated Scr, BUN, and uACR levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, reduced inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and the renal tubular injury marker (Lcn2), and improved epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evidenced by a marked upregulation of E-cadherin and downregula- tion of α-SMA and Vimentin at both mRNA and protein levels in renal cortices of DN mice. , ANGPTL8 inhibition also protected human proximal tubular epithelial cells against HGPA-induced inflam- mation and EMT. Mechanistically, intracellular ANGPTL8 was found to directly bind and activate Akt2, triggering downstream nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) inhibition, which collectively drive inflammatory cytokine production and EMT progression.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrate for the first time that elevated tubular ANGPTL8 promotes tubular inflammation and fibrosis during DN by interacting with Akt2, highlighting the ANGPTL8-Akt2 axis as a promising therapeutic target to prevent DN progression.

**Background and aims:**
Despite improvements in care many people with type 1 diabetes develop kidney disease and progress to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are limited numbers of stud- ies that compare factors that predict progression of kidney disease in contemporaneous cohorts of people with type 1 diabetes from diverse ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied three cohorts of people with type 1 diabetes in London and Finland to investigate what variables and risk factors were similar or different between these distinct popula- tions. In brief, people with type 1 diabetes of white heritage (n= 2536, 51% women with mean±SD age 35.0±12.0 years), and black heritage (n=362, 58% women, mean age 31.4 ±11.7 years) in London were compared with people with type 1 diabetes of white heritage from Finland (n= 3066, 50% women, mean age 37.3 ±11.7 years). All had baseline estimated eGFR (CKD-EPI equation) ≥45 ml/min/1.73m . Data were collected between 2004 and 2018 in London (median follow- up 6 years) and between 1995 and 2024 in Finland (median follow- up 12 years). Heritage was self-reported by participants and clinical/ biochemical data extracted from health records. The primary endpoint was a >50% drop in eGFR from baseline with final eGFR <30 ml/ min/1.73m

**Results:**
In the London cohort of white heritage 85 (3.3%) people reached the primary endpoint. Similarly, 34 (9.2%) black people liv- ing in London and 288 (9.4%) white people from Finland reached the primary endpoint. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, the base- line variables associated with the primary endpoint for white people in London were: systolic BP (SBP) [HR 1.61, 95%CI (1.34-1.93)], HbA1c [1.86 (1.60-2.16)] and severe albuminuria (A3) [3.82 (1.51- 9.6)], whereas higher eGFR decreased the hazard [0.50 (0.38-0.66)] (p<0.05 for all). Similarly, for white people in Finland, HbA1c [1.71 (1.53-1.90)], SBP [1.25 (1.10-1.42)], triglycerides [1.22 (1.12-1.33)], moderate (A2) [2.84 (1.97-4.11)] and severe albuminuria (A3) [7.69 (5.69-11.13)] were associated with an increased hazard, while higher eGFR decreased the hazard [0.57 (0.51-0.84)] (p<0.05 for all). For black people living in London HbA1c [1.41 (1.01-1.96)], diastolic BP [2.58 (1.78-3.74)], and severe albuminuria (A3) [5.53(1.29-23.6)] were independently associated with an increased hazard for the primary endpoint (p<0.05 for all). A similar tendency was observed for triglyc- erides ([1.24 (1.00-1.53)], p=0.05).

**Conclusion:**
In three distinct cohorts of people living with type 1 dia- betes in London and Finland, we observed similar traditional risk fac- tors (baseline HbA1c, BP and albuminuria) for increased risk of kidney disease progression. The impact of triglycerides (an index of insulin resistance which is associated with CKD) was noted in white people in Finland and black people in London who both had higher rates of progression of kidney disease as compared to white people in London. Further studies that determine the causal role of variables for kidney disease progression in ethnically diverse cohorts are required.

4. Health System Research, Leipzig, Germany, AstraZeneca, BioPhar-

**Background and aims:**
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common comorbidity among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), sig- nificantly impacting healthcare systems. Despite this burden, broader data on the prevalence and management of CKD in T2DM patients remain scarce. This secondary analysis of claims data examined the epidemi- ology, comorbidities, and healthcare utilization of CKD patients with T2DM in Germany. The findings aim to enable policymakers and health- care professionals to make informed decisions on disease management and resource allocation, ultimately improving care for CKD patients.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective analysis examined real-world data from a representative German claims database spanning 2018 to 2022 to detail the epidemiological profile of patients with CKD and T2DM. It evaluated disease prevalence, all-cause mortality, comorbidities, costs, and healthcare resource utilization metrics. Patients were identified based on at least one disease-defining ICD-10 code and medication use was ana- lyzed via ATC codes. Prevalence was calculated annually, and descriptive statistics were applied to adjust data for national demographics.

**Results:**
In 2022, the prevalence of T2DM in Germany was 9.8%, with 23.2% of these patients also diagnosed with CKD, amounting to approximately 1.92 million individuals. The all-cause mortality rate for CKD patients with T2DM was 9.9%. Hospitalization data revealed that 876,491 patients were admitted, culminating in 1,856,925 hospital admissions, with 20.7% of admitted patients experiencing rehospitali- zation within 30 days and an average stay of 9.5 days. First-line therapy for CKD patients is ACEi/ARBs and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Medical therapy usage was notable for ACEi / ARBs at 69.8%, SGLT2i at 24.7%, and 19.2% of patients receiving both. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension, disorders of lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases, affecting 95.8%, 74.6%, and 61.3% of patients, respectively. The total cost of managing this cohort was approximately €27.8 billion, averaging €14,000 per patient in 2022. This represented 8.8% of the total health insurance expenditures, despite the patient group constituting only 2.3% of the population.

**Conclusion:**
The analysis highlights the substantial burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the German healthcare system and underscores the need for targeted interventions in this high-risk cohort. The find- ings reveal high rates of hospitalization, mortality, and considerable healthcare costs, illustrating the complex management needs of this population. Notably, the low uptake of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) may offer an opportunity to reduce hospitalizations and costs. Effective disease management strategies and optimized resource allocation are essential to improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare expenditures. These insights should help policy- makers and healthcare professionals to develop strategies to enhance care for CKD patients with T2DM.

**Background and aims:**
Red cell distribution width (RDW) serves as an indicator of erythrocyte size heterogeneity and is increasingly acknowledged as a potential biomarker for a range of clinical con- ditions, including renal impairment and microalbuminuria (MAU). An elevation in RDW may signify underlying processes such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired erythropoiesis, all of which are pertinent to the pathophysiology associated with diabetic nephropathy. While previous studies have identified an association between RDW and MAU in small cohorts of patients with diabetes, its predictive significance within extensive, population-based data- sets remains ambiguous. The current study aims to elucidate the rela- tionship between RDW and MAU using data from the UK Biobank. This involves a comparative analysis of RDW levels between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, examination of trends across RDW quartiles, and evaluation of the predictive value of RDW for related clinical outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted involving a total of 502,224 participants from the UK Biobank, among which 26,390 individuals (5.3%) were identified as diabetic. Data about demographics and biochemical measures were extracted, encompassing metrics such as red cell distribution width, creatinine levels, age, sex, and diabetes status. RDW values were stratified into quartiles to evaluate variations in MAU prevalence. Further- more, logistic regression analysis was employed to ascertain the association between RDW and MAU, with adjustments made for covariates including creatinine, age, sex, and diabetes status. The predictive capacity of RDW for MAU was assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, where area under the curve (AUC) values were computed. Additionally, odds ratios (OR) for each unit increment in RDW were calculated to quantify this relationship.

**Results:**
Mean RDW was significantly higher in diabetic persons compared to non-diabetic persons (13.74% vs. 13.48%, p < 0.001). Quartile analysis revealed increasing MAU prevalence across RDW quartiles among diabetic persons, ranging from 15.3% in the lowest quartile (12.6%) to 26.8% in the highest quartile (14.9%). In non- diabetic persons, MAU prevalence rose from 4.0% to 7.4% across the same RDW quartiles. Logistic regression confirmed that RDW was an independent predictor of MAU (OR = 1.14 per unit increase in RDW, 95% CI: 1.13-1.16, p < 0.001). Among diabetic persons, RDW remained a significant predictor (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.10- 1.14, p < 0.001), and the predictive performance was good (AUC = 0.872). The optimal RDW cut-off for predicting MAU in diabetic persons was 15.695%, with a sensitivity of 82.2% and specificity of 80.5%.

**Conclusion:**
This extensive analysis, utilising data from the UK Biobank, affirms a significant correlation between RDW and Micro- albuminuria MAU, particularly among individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The predictive model demonstrated good efficacy, achieving an AUC of 0.872. This suggests that RDW is a valuable biomarker. Future research endeavours should explore the feasibil- ity of integrating RDW with additional metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers to enhance the predictive accuracy of renal complications associated with diabetes.

**Precision medicine in type 2 diabetes: targeting GLP1 receptor agonist and SGLT2-inhibitor combination treatment for kidney protection**

1. University of Exeter, Exeter, UK, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.

**Background and aims:**
ADA/EASD guidelines recommend SGLT2- inhibitor (SGLT2i) treatment for kidney protection in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recent trials have shown GLP1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) reduce the risk of kidney failure as well, but these trials had limited power to determine whether this benefit applies to people also on SGLT2i. We therefore evaluated the additive kidney protection effect of GLP1-RA + SGLT2i combination therapy, and propose using an existing clinical risk score to identify those with greatest kidney protection benefit from combination treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
We used electronic health record data from UK primary care (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, 2013-2023) to identify adults with T2D and eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73m who started GLP1-RA (n=40,112) or SGLT2i only (n=122,343), GLP1-RA + SGLT2i combination treatment (n=21,223), or comparator drugs dipep- tidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors/sulfonylureas (DPP4i/SU; n=143,392). We evaluated treatment effects on kidney disease progression (≥50% eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, or kidney-related death) over 3 years using doubly robust overlap-weighted Cox proportional hazards mod- els. We used the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) risk score for kidney disease progression to identify those with greatest benefit from GLP1-RA + SGLT2i combination treatment. To do this, we chose a threshold in the CKD-PC risk score that would identify the same num- ber of people as an albuminuria ≥300mg/g threshold (as reference). We estimated their 3-year absolute risk reductions with GLP1-RA + SGLT2i combination treatment.

**Results:**
The incidence of kidney disease progression was lowest with GLP1-RA + SGLT2i combination treatment (incidence rate 2.8 per 1000 patient-years), followed by SGLT2i only (3.2 per 1000 patient years), GLP1-RA only (4.7 per 1000 patient-years), and DPP4i/SU (5.5 per 1000 patient-years). GLP1-RA + SGLT2i combination treatment was associated with a 55% lower risk of kidney disease progression compared to DPP4i/SU (HR 0.45, 95%CI 0.36-0.56). This was greater than the relative risk reductions with GLP1-RA only (HR 0.69, 95%CI 0.59-0.80) or SGLT2i only (HR 0.57, 95%CI 0.50-0.65) compared to DPP4i/SU. Compared to SGLT2i only, GLP1-RA + SGLT2i combina- tion treatment was associated with a further 21% risk reduction (HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.64-0.98). An interaction term for GLP1-RA and SGLT2i was non-significant (p=0.33) suggesting an essentially additive effect of GLP1-RA to SGLT2i treatment. In our study cohort, we estimate that targeting GLP1-RA + SGLT2i combination treatment to people with albuminuria ≥300mg/g only (n=7,810) would yield a 3-year abso- lute risk reduction in kidney disease progression of 0.9% compared to SGLT2i only treatment (3.5% if comparing GLP1-RA + SGLT2i vs DPP4i/SU). In contrast, using the CKD-PC risk score to target combi- nation treatment to the same number of people would result in a greater absolute risk reduction of 1.1% compared to SGLT2i only treatment (4.7% if comparing GLP1-RA + SGLT2i vs DPP4i/SU).

**Conclusion:**
GLP1-RA + SGLT2i combination treatment provides additional kidney protection benefit beyond treatment with SGLT2i alone. The internationally validated CKD-PC risk score could iden- tify those with greatest benefit from combination treatment, offering a simple, practical approach to ensure high-risk patients receive optimal kidney protection treatment.

**TLE4 modulates diabetic nephropathy-associated inflammation via the cGAS-STING pathway**

X. Xu

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a leading cause of chronic kidney disease, is driven by chronic inflammation. Trans- ducin-like enhancer of split 4 (TLE4), a transcriptional co-repressor implicated in renal development and inflammation, may regulate the cGAS-STING pathway—a key mediator of innate immunity and DN pathogenesis. This study investigates the role of TLE4 in DN-asso- ciated inflammation and its interaction with the cGAS-STING axis.

**Materials and methods:**
Clinical data from 1,940 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM; 1,226 non-DN, 714 DN) were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate systemic inflammatory indices (NLR, NHR, SIRI) and their association with DN. Bioinformatics analysis of GEO datasets (GSE30528, GSE30122, GSE1009) compared TLE4 expres- sion in DN versus healthy kidneys. In vitro, palmitic acid (PA)- treated BUMPT renal tubular cells and HEK293T/HEK293 models were used to assess TLE4’s regulatory effects on cGAS-STING. siRNA-mediated TLE4 knockdown, Western blotting, qRT-PCR, co- immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), immunofluorescence, and AlphaFold- based protein docking were performed.

**Results:**
Elevated NLR, NHR, and SIRI independently predicted DN risk (adjusted ORs: 2.303, 1.309, 3.089; AUCs: 0.869, 0.692, 0.832; all P<0.001). DN patients exhibited reduced renal TLE4 expression (P<0.05). PA-induced DN models showed suppressed TLE4 and activated cGAS-STING signaling (p-STING, p-TBK1, p-IRF3, IFNβ ; P<0.05). TLE4 knockdown exacerbated cGAS-STING activation and inflammatory cytokine release. Co-IP and immunofluorescence confirmed TLE4-STING interaction and nuclear-cytoplasmic co- localization. AlphaFold modeling revealed a high-affinity TLE4- STING binding interface (−14 kcal/mol).

**Conclusion:**
TLE4 downregulation promotes cGAS-STING-driven inflammation in DN, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. This study uncovers a novel TLE4-dependent regulatory mechanism linking metabolic stress to renal inflammation in diabetes.

**Effects of oral semaglutide on hospitalisation rates in people with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or**

**Background and aims:**
People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and athero- sclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or chronic kidney dis- ease (CKD) are at high risk of hospitalisation. In the Semaglutide car- diOvascular oUtcomes triaL (SOUL), oral semaglutide demonstrated superiority over placebo in reducing the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. Pre-specified secondary analyses explored in- trial hospitalisation rates.

**Materials and methods:**
This double-blind, randomised, event-driven trial included 9650 participants with T2D and ASCVD and/or CKD, aged ≥50 years, with ­HbA 6.5-10.0%, randomised 1:1 to receive oral semaglutide or placebo. Hospitalisations were identified from reports of serious adverse events (SAEs) recorded by study investigators as per protocol and categorised by system organ class (SOC) using Med- DRA v.27.0.

**Results:**
Participants (mean±SD age 66.1±7.6 years, 71.1% male, baseline BMI 31.1±5.8 kg/m , ­HbA 8.0±1.1%) were followed up for a mean of 47.5±10.9 months. Oral semaglutide was associated with significant reductions ( <0.01) in incidence of first hospitalisa- tion, numbers of hospitalisations, numbers of hospitalisations lasting ≥3 days or ending in death, and total days hospitalised compared with placebo (Table). The risks of initial hospitalisation due to SAEs in those SOCs with the highest incidence rates, cardiac events (HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.78-0.94]) and infections and infestations (HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.80-0.98]) were significantly reduced with oral semaglutide versus placebo.

**Conclusion:**
In this high-risk population with frequent hospitalisa- tions, treatment with oral semaglutide significantly reduced hospi- talisations due to SAEs compared with placebo. The observed safety profile of semaglutide in the SOUL trial was consistent with prior reports.

**Background and aims:**
GLP-1 RAs are highly effective peptides increasingly used for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity management. However, mainly injectable options are available except for oral sema- glutide. RGT-075 is a new, non-peptide, small molecule oral GLP-1 RA being developed as a treatment for adults with obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
This phase 2a, randomized, double-blind trial (NCT06277934 involved adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²) with at least one comorbidity and no T2D (HbA1c < 6.5%). Participants (N=73) were randomly assigned to either 125 mg of RGT-075 or placebo once daily for 12 weeks, with a 6-week dose titration (from 15 to 125 mg QD) followed by a 6-week dose maintenance period (125 mg QD).

**Results:**
Baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the groups (median age 50.0 yrs, Weight 103.9 kg, BMI 36.6 kg/m²). Out of the total participants, 50 received RGT-075, and 23 received pla- cebo. At week 12, the LS mean percentage change in body weight was -5.4% with RGT-075 compared to -0.45% with placebo (p < 0.0001). In addition, a significant and clinical meaningful reduction of systolic (-10.8 mmHg (placebo adjusted), p = 0.0022) and diastolic (-4.9 mmHg (placebo adjusted), p = 0.0371) blood pressure was observed. There was no pulse rate increases. The most frequently reported adverse events in the RGT-075 group were nausea (40%) and vomiting (24%), which were mild or moderate. No liver abnormalities or other serious adverse events related to RGT-075 were observed. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events (AEs) was 4% for both RGT-075 and placebo. The pharmacokinetic profile supported once-daily (QD) oral dosing.

**Conclusion:**
RGT-075, a small molecule oral GLP-1 RA, demon- strated a significant weight reduction with robust blood pressure changes and a safety profile consisted with the GLP-1 RA class. These findings support further clinical development of RGT-075.

**Eloralintide, a selective, long-acting amylin receptor agonist for obesity: phase 1 proof of concept**

E. Pratt, Tidemann-Miller

**Background and aims:**
Eloralintide (Elora; LY3841136) is a potent, long-acting once-weekly (QW) amylin receptor agonist under develop- ment for obesity. Unlike other amylin agonist molecules (e.g., Cagrilin- tide), it is designed to have minimal calcitonin activity in the clinic.

**Materials and methods:**
This 12 week (wk) phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluated safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of QW subcutaneous Elora in participants with obesity or overweight. 100 participants, mean 44 years old, 29% female, and BMI of 27-43 kg/m , were randomized to Elora or placebo in 5 multiple ascending dose cohorts.

**Results:**
At wk 12, AUC(0-∞), AUCτ,ss, and ­C were dose pro- portional with ratios of dose normalized geometric means of 1.2, 1.1, and 1.0, respectively. The mean half-life was 13.9 to 15.8 days. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring with Elora were decreased appetite (19%), headache (12%), fatigue (11%), and COVID-19 (11%). Minimal gastrointestinal (GI) events occurred in Elora participants; diarrhea (10%), nausea (8%), and vomiting (4%). Most TEAEs were mild in severity. No deaths and 1 (4%) serious AE unrelated to Elora occurred. At wk 12 with Elora, LS mean percent change in body weight ranged from -2.6 to -11.3%.

**Conclusion:**
At 12 wks, Elora QW was well tolerated with minimal GI AEs and resulted in meaningful weight loss. An ongoing Phase 2 study will further explore efficacy and tolerability of Elora.

**Integrating clinical data and genetic risk scores to identify pre- dictors of drug response in type 2 diabetes cohorts**

S. Garg

1. University of Dundee, Dundee, UK, Novo Nordisk Research Centre

**Background and aims:**
People with type 2 diabetes respond dif- ferently to various glucose-lowering medications, highlighting the heterogeneity in drug response. This variability is influenced by both clinical and genetic factors, which can affect treatment efficacy. Some of these differences may stem from the underlying aetiology of dia- betes, including variations in beta-cell function, insulin resistance, and other metabolic pathways. We assessed aetiological variation using partitioned polygenic risk scores (pPRS) and evaluated their impact on glycaemic response across all commonly used diabetes drugs.

**Materials and methods:**
The study used electronic health records from patients in the Tayside & Fife region of Scotland. Data included six drug classes: Metformin, Sulfonylureas, DPP4 inhibitors, TZDs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists. The glycaemic response was evaluated using HbA1c measurements taken before and after treatment. Our primary outcome was the change in HbA1c levels 12 months after treatment initiation. A secondary outcome was defined as achieving an HbA1c level below 58 mmol/mol. To assess predictors of drug response, we employed both linear regression for continuous HbA1c change and logistic regression for the binary outcome. Sepa- rate prediction models incorporating clinical variables and partitioned polygenic risk scores were developed using stepwise backward regres- sion. Statistical significance of input predictors was determined using p-values.

**Results:**
The cohort comprised 34,201 patients with clinical records and 10,811 patients with genotype data. Clinical predictors such as Baseline HBA1c, BMI, gender, creatinine levels, ALT/SGPT levels, and bilirubin were significant predictors of differential drug response (p-value < 0.001). Specific aetiological partitioned polygenic risk scores were associated with different drug outcomes: Beta Cell function pPRS with sulphonylurea response (p < 0.01), Bilirubin pPRS with DPP4 response (p < 0.05) and Lipodystrophy pPRS with metformin response (p < 0.01). These findings will be further validated using data from the UK Biobank.

**Conclusion:**
The genetic aetiology of diabetes, captured by various partitioned polygenic risk scores, provides valuable insights into how aetiological variation contributes to differential drug responses. Our findings highlight that genetic risk factors can add value beyond tradi- tional clinical predictors, offering potential improvements in treatment selection. With the increasing availability of genotyping at the point of prescribing, incorporating pPRS into prediction models could enhance drug response predictions. However, further validation in diverse popu- lations and larger cohorts is needed to establish clinical utility.

**Enhancement of a five-drug class model for type 2 diabetes treat- ment selection to include oral and injectable semaglutide**

1. University of Exeter, Exeter, UK, University of Dundee, Glencarse,

**Background and aims:**
We recently developed and validated a five- drug class treatment selection model using routine clinical data to iden- tify optimal glucose-lowering therapies for people with type 2 diabetes (Dennis ., The Lancet 2025; web calculator: www.diabetesgenes. org/t2-treatment/). A limitation of the original model was that semaglu- tide was not included in the GLP1-receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) drug class due to a lack of treatment initiation data at the time. To address this, we aimed to extend the five-drug class model to accurately predict glycaemic response to oral and injectable semaglutide.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed UK primary care data (CPRD Aurum) for non-insulin treated individuals with type 2 diabetes ini- tiating semaglutide up to Jun 2024. Oral and injectable semaglutide initiations were evaluated separately. The primary outcome was ­HbA treatment response at 12-months. We assessed the calibration of observed 12-month response with semaglutide versus predicted 12-month ­HbA for non-semaglutide GLP1-RA initiations (liraglu- tide, dulaglutide, exenatide) from the original five-drug model. We also compared differences in observed semaglutide response and other GLP1-RA medication to those estimated in a recent trial network meta- analysis. We validated the new model using a previously published methodology, which compares predicted versus observed differential treatment effects in patients who initiated the model-predicted optimal therapy (concordant) and those who did not (discordant).

**Results:**
There were 2,273 new users of oral semaglutide and 5,114 new users of injectable semaglutide with complete model predictors (mean ± SD baseline characteristics: ­HbA 74.3 ± 13.4 mmol/mol, age 58.6 ± 10.5 years, BMI 36.4 ± 7.3 kg/m , eGFR 93.0 ± 18.4 ml/min per 1.73m , 55.2% male). At 12-months, ­HbA responses for oral semaglutide were similar to non-semaglutide GLP-1RA initia- tions and did not require any adjustments to the model’s predictions, aligning with previous trial findings. Conversely, the ­HbA responses at 12-months for injectable semaglutide were 7.3 mmol/mol higher (95%CI 7.8;6.8) when compared to older GLP-1RA initiations requiring an adjustment to model predictions (intercept 5.74 95%CI 3.06;8.42, slope 0.80 95%CI 0.76;0.84), also in line with previous trial findings. After the model update, predictions of differential response with oral and injectable semaglutide versus the other drug classes showed excellent calibration.

**Conclusion:**
An extended five-drug class treatment selection model can accurately predict the relative glucose-lowering efficacy of oral and injectable semaglutide versus other drug classes. This enhance- ment is a major step in supporting the implementation of this model in clinical care worldwide.

**Efficacy and durability of early quadruple with lobeglitazone and empagliflozin to uncontrolled type 2 diabetes under metformin and**

**Background and aims:**
Early intensive combination therapy may ben- efit patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who exhibit inadequate gly- caemic control with oral agents. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of early quadruple combination therapy—including a sodium- glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2-i) and a thiazolidinedione (TZD)—as opposed to conventional stepwise escalation to quadruple therapy following triple therapy, in people inadequately controlled on metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4-i).

**Materials and methods:**
In this randomised, open-label, parallel- group study, patients aged 19-74 years with T2D were eligible after ≥12 weeks of dual therapy with metformin (≥1000 mg/day) and a DPP4-i, and ­HbA between 7.0% and 8.5% at screening. Participants were randomised to the early quadruple combination therapy (EQC) group, which received 0.5 mg lobeglitazone (TZD) and 25 mg empa- gliflozin (SGLT2-i), or to the stepwise escalation therapy (SE) group, initiating treatment with either lobeglitazone or empagliflozin. From week 14, SE group participants with ­HbA levels >7.0% received add- on therapy: empagliflozin was added for those receiving lobeglitazone, and lobeglitazone was added for those receiving empagliflozin. Par- ticipants with ­HbA >7.0% at two consecutive study visits, scheduled at 14-week intervals—either after the addition of the second agent in the SE group or from baseline in the EQC group—were discontinued according to predefined treatment failure criteria. The primary endpoint was glycaemic control at week 112.

**Results:**
A total of 158 participants were randomised to the EQC group (n=51), the SE group starting with lobeglitazone (n=56), or the SE group starting with empagliflozin (n=51). During the 112-week period, the EQC group showed a significantly greater reduction in ­HbA com- pared with the SE group (7.47±0.30% to 6.37±0.32% vs. 7.47±0.29% to 6.55±0.43%; time × group interaction, P = 0.031). Insulin resist- ance, as assessed by HOMA-IR, improved significantly more in the EQC group compared with the SE group (7.06 to 1.88 vs. 4.69 to 2.19; P = 0.020). Body weight showed no significant change in the EQC group (78.1 kg to 76.6 kg; P = 0.314), whereas it decreased signifi- cantly in the SE group starting with empagliflozin (72.4 kg to 69.6 kg; P < 0.001). Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, assessed by transient elastog- raphy, showed similar and significant improvement across groups: the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) decreased from 292.6 to 248.1 dB/m in the EQC group and from 282.8 to 238.3 dB/m in the SE group (P = 0.999); liver stiffness measurement (LSM) decreased from 6.52 to 4.83 kPa in the EQC group and from 6.08 to 5.11 kPa in the SE group (P = 0.319). All treatments were safe, with rare discontinuation due to adverse events and no hypoglycemic events reported in any group.

**Conclusion:**
Early quadruple combination therapy with lobeglitazone and empagliflozin improved glycemic control and insulin resistance without increasing adverse events in people with T2D inadequately controlled with metformin and a DPP4-i.

**Metabolic effects of semaglutide combined with a calorie-restricted diet in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes**

X. Tang

**Background and aims:**
Both semaglutide and calorie-restricted diet have been previously shown to improve metabolic status in patients with obesity or diabetes. The present study aims to explore the combi- nation effect of semaglutide and calorie-restricted diet on the metabolic status of patients with both obesity and type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
In this single-center prospective study, obese individuals (body mass index > 30 kg/m ) with type 2 diabetes were treated with either semaglutide alone (n=28), calorie-restricted diet alone (n=32, 1500 kcal for men and 1200 kcal for women), or both (n=25) for 3 months. Another age, sex and body mass index-matched obese patients with type 2 diabetes without any treatments served as controls. Metabolic status was evaluated with fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), changes of body mass index, and insu- lin resistance as indicated by the homeostatic model (HOMA-IR) that is calculated from fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin at both baseline and 3 months later.

**Results:**
At 3 months, semaglutide alone, calorie-restricted diet alone, and both were associated with significantly improved metabolic status than the control group. Treatment with both semaglutide and calorie- restricted diet could induce significantly higher HOMA-IR, fasting blood glucose and HbA1C decrease (P<0.001), but did not seem to cause greater body mass index reduction, as compared to semaglutide (2.31 ± 0.45 vs 2.17±0.35, P>0.05) or calorie-restricted diet alone (2.31±0.45 vs 2.09±0.39, P>0.05).

**Conclusion:**
The combination of semaglutide and calorie-restricted diet could significantly improve insulin resistance but did not seem to cause further weight reduction, as compared to semaglutide or calorie- restricted diet alone.

**Phase 2 clinical trials of NA-931 to study subjects who are obese with at least one weight-related comorbid condition**

L.L. Tran

**Background and aims:**
NA-931 is a first-in-class, orally administered small molecule that acts as a quadruple receptor agonist, targeting the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP- 1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon receptors. The objective of the Phase 2 clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral administration of NA-931 for obesity treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
This Phase 2 trial is a 13-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and weight-loss efficacy of NA-931. The study enrolled 125 adult participants who were either obese (BMI ≥30 kg/ m²) or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m²) with at least one weight-related comorbidity. Age ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consentBody mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 with at least one weight-related co-morbid condition (treated or untreated), and BMI <50 kg/m2. (1) History of or current clinically significant medical or psychiatric dis- order that, in the opinion of the Investigator, does not support study participation. (2) Self-reported body weight change of 5% or more within 3 months of screening. (3) Current or past diagnosis of diabe- tes mellitus (including type 1, type 2, gestational). (4) Current or past diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. (5) Calcitonin ≥20 ng/L measured by central laboratory at screening (individuals with elevated calcitonin at initial screening may be re-screened). (6) Any Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist or GLP-1/ Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) dual agonist within 6 months of Screening. (7) Any prescription or over-the-counter medications intended for weight loss within 6 months of screening. Primary Outcome Measures:Percent (relative) change from baseline to Week 13 in body weight. Secondary Outcome Measures:Proportion of Subjects losing ≥5% and ≥10% of baseline weight at Week 13Incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESI) at Week 13

**Results:**
The 13-week multiple ascending dose (MAD) study demonstrated that NA-931 produced dose-depend- ent reductions in mean body weight from baseline, with a maximum reduction of 14.8% at the 150 mg daily dosage—13.2% greater than placebo. An exploratory analysis showed that up to 72% of NA- 931-treated subjects achieved at least 12% weight loss after 13 weeks, compared to 2% in the placebo group. Treat- ment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in NA-931-treated subjects were predominantly mild or insignificant. Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were mostly mild (83%), with nausea and vomiting reported as insignificant. Diarrhea occurred in 8.1% of NA-931-treated subjects, compared to 3.2% in the placebo group. Importantly, no muscle loss was observed. There were no clinically meaningful differences in GI- related adverse events between the NA-931 and placebo groups.

**Conclusion:**
The topline results of the Phase 2 trial support NA-931 as a promising first-in-class oral quadruple receptor agonist for weight loss, demonstrating excellent efficacy and safety. The company is advancing NA-931 to Phase 3 trials.

**Background and aims:**
VRB-101 is an oral tablet formulation of ecno- glutide, a cAMP-biased, long-acting GLP-1 analog being developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. VRB-101 is formu- lated with a proprietary permeation enhancer, T2026, with improved oral bioavailability. Phase 1 clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability data were presented previously. Here we present pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of 30 mg daily dose of VRB-101 and the modeled PK data supporting the potential of VRB-101 as a once-weekly (QW) oral GLP-1 tablet for the treatment of obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study in healthy adults with and without obesity. Participants were randomized to receive VRB-101 escalated to the target doses of 7, 15, or 30 mg QD for up to 6 weeks. PK samples were collected, including up to 7 days after the last daily dose. We used the data to model the PK profile of QW dosing with VRB-101.

**Results:**
After the last 30 mg daily oral dose of VRB-101, PK samples were collected up to 168 hours post-dosing and PK parameters for the 7-day period were calculated. This 7-day PK profile was then used to model the steady state PK of 60 mg, 90 mg and 120 mg QW dosing. The PK model projected 60 mg QW dose to reach a steady state weekly exposure (AUC ) of 43,246 h*ng/mL, 90 mg QW dose to reach exposure of 64,869 h*ng/mL, and 120 mg QW dose to reach expo- sure of 86,493 h*ng/mL. These exposures are nearing or exceeding the weekly exposure achieved by 2.4 mg subcutaneous semaglutide or 2.4 mg subcutaneous ecnoglutide.

**Conclusion:**
This data supports the rationale for VRB-101 to be a QW oral GLP-1 treatment. Compared with subcutaneous injections, oral QW 90 mg and 120 mg VRB-101 are projected to match or exceed the weekly exposures of subcutaneous GLP-1 injections. VRB-101 is expected to exert potent weight lowering while improving adherence via a more patient-friendly dosing regimen. Once-weekly oral admin- istration represents an opportunity towards more scalable treatment option than currently available injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists.

**Association between Alzheimer’s disease and obesity: clinical trials of NA-831 for AD and clinical trials of NA-931 for obesity**

L.L. Tran

**Background and aims:**
This study evaluates the potential associa- tion between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and obesity by comparing two orally administered analog drugs: NA-831 and NA-931. NA-831 exhibits neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and memory-enhancing proper- ties for AD treatment, while NA-931, a quadruple receptor agonist of IGF-1, GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon, is designed for obesity treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
NA-831: A randomized, double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of NA-831 in Alzheimer patients with mild cognitive impairment. Key Inclusion Criteria: Is male or female, at 55-85 years of age (inclusive) at screening self-reported memory complaint, corroborated by spouse or companion as appropriate. Wechsler Memory Scale III (WMS-III) age-adjusted Logical Memory II score ≤ 5.Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) ≥23Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) score <27; Key Exclusion Criteria: Subjects who have any significant, untreated psychiatric illness or any CNS condition (such as schizophre- nia, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, etc.) that could interfere with the study evaluations or procedures or which poses an additional risk.Evidence of a clinically relevant or unstable psychiatric disorder, excluding major depression in remissionHistory of significant head trauma followed by persistent neurologic defaults or known structural brain abnormali- ties.NA-931: A phase 2, 13-week randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel arm study that will evaluate the safety, tolerability, weight loss efficacy of NA-931 in adults who are obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or who are overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) with at least one weight-related co-morbid condition. Key Inclusion Criteria: Age ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consentBody mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 with at least one weight-related co-morbid condition (treated or untreated), and BMI <50 kg/m2; Key Exclusion Criteria: History of or current clinically significant medical or psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, does not support study participationSelf-reported body weight change of 5% or more within 3 months of screeningCurrent or past diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (including type 1, type 2, gestational)

**Results:**
NA-831: NA-831 showed a significant improvement for patients with mild and moderate AD with the ADAS-Cog-13 score change of an average of 4.1 as compared to the placebo after 24 weeks of treatment (p = 0.001; ITT). CIBIC-Plus showed 78 % patients improved (p = 0.01; ITT). It was observed that 66% patients having diabetes on the NA-831 drug treatment reported a loss of up to 13.7% of body weight over 6 months. There were no serious adverse events observed. NA-931: The 13-week MAD study showed NA-931 demon- strated dose-dependent reductions in mean body weight from baseline, up to 14.8 % at 150 mg daily dosage, or 13.2% % relative to placebo.An exploratory assessment of subjects achieving at least 5% weight loss after 13-week demonstrated that up to 72% of NA-931-treated sub- jects achieved ≥12% weight loss, compared with 2% for placebo. No clinically meaningful differences were reported for GI-related adverse events among subjects treated with NA-931 compared with placebo.

**Conclusion:**
The clinical findings of NA-831 and NA-931 suggest a potential link between Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, and obesity. How- ever, further research is needed to determine whether this association is causal.

**Background and aims:**
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD/ NASH) is a major health concern, especially in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Insulin resistance (IR) accelerates NAFLD progression from simple hepatic steatosis to more severe conditions, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Chronic hyper- insulinemia, a hallmark of IR, triggers hepatocyte senescence via the ZMAT3-p53-p21 axis, thereby contributing to metabolic impairment. Recent evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between chronic hyperinsulinemia and IR, with cellular senescence (CS) as a key mediator. Chronic hyperinsulinemia induces CS, which exacerbates IR and inflammation, creating a vicious cycle. While this mechanism is well-documented in adipose tissue, it is less understood in other cells. Despite efforts to develop effective therapies, treatment options for NAFLD/NASH are still limited. GLP-1RAs, commonly used in T2D management, have emerged as promising treatments. Beyond their established role in regulating glucose metabolism, these drugs also provide an opportunity to target CS. This study investigates GLP-1 and GLP-1RA Exendin-4 (Ex4) role in counteracting hyperinsulinemia- induced hepatocyte senescence, highlighting their potential for treating fatty liver disease.

**Materials and methods:**
Human hepatocytes were chronically exposed to hyperinsulinemia to induce senescence, followed by treatment with Ex4 or GLP-1 for 24h. Several senescence markers and senescence- associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors were analyzed by qPCR and Western blot. Loss-of-function experiments were conducted to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying the Ex4 and GLP-1 anti-senescence effects.

**Results:**
In hyperinsulinemia-treated hepatocytes, Ex4 and GLP-1 significantly reduced the senescence-related proteins ZMAT3 (Ex4 p<0.05; GLP-1 p<0.01), p53 (Ex4 and GLP-1 p<0.05), p21 (Ex4 and GLP-1 p<0.01), and phosphorylated γH2AX (Ex4 p<0.001; GLP-1 p<0.05). Both treatments also lowered mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory SASP factors (Ex4 and GLP-1 p<0.001) and (Ex4 p=0.05; GLP-1 p=0.05), while GLP-1 further decreased expression (Ex4 and GLP-1 p<0.05). Untreated cells showed no significant effects, indicating that Ex4 and GLP-1 protective actions are specific to hyperinsulinemia-induced senes- cence. This specificity may be due to changes in GLP-1 receptor availability and the DPP4-mediated degradation of these drugs. Since hyperinsulinemia did not alter GLP-1 receptor expression, we assessed DPP4 levels and found significant downregulation of DPP4 in hyperinsulinemia-treated hepatocytes by both agents (Ex4 p<0.001; GLP-1 p<0.01). To investigate the mechanisms underly- ing their anti-senescence effects, we examined AMPK activation as a well-known regulator of CS. Hyperinsulinemia suppressed AMPK activation and this was partially restored by Ex4 and GLP-1 (Ex4 and GLP-1 p<0.05) supporting this as a potential mechanism for their anti-senescence effects.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, Ex4 and GLP-1 reduce hyperinsuline- mia-induced hepatocyte senescence, likely via AMPK activation, supporting their potential as treatments for NAFLD/NASH and related metabolic complications.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity causes low-grade inflammation, which can lead to endothelial dysfunction and the development of atherosclerosis, the foremost underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. Both exercise and incretin-based therapy can reduce the obesity-associated risk of cardiovascular events; however, their impact on the development of atherosclerosis during weight loss maintenance remains unclear. We evaluated the effects of exercise versus incretin-based therapy during weight loss maintenance on biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial function, as well as ath- erosclerosis assessed by ultrasound.

**Materials and methods:**
Adults with obesity without diabetes were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, two-by-two factorial trial. Of 215 total participants, 195 participants completed an 8-week low-cal- orie diet (see Table 1 for baseline characteristics) and were randomly assigned to 52 weeks of weight loss maintenance with or without exercise and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide 3.0 mg/day or placebo treatment. We evaluated circulating biomarkers of inflammation (IL-6 and IFN-γ) and endothelial dysfunction (ICAM- 1, VCAM-1, and tPA), as well as ultrasound-assessed carotid intima- media thickness (cIMT) during the weight maintenance period using a linear mixed model.

**Results:**
Following a diet-induced weight loss of 13.1 kg, both exercise and liraglutide treatment led to maintained weight loss. During the 52-week weight maintenance period, exercising vs. non-exercising par- ticipants had reduced IL-6 (-21%, 95%CI -34 to -10, P=0.012), IFN-γ (-27%, -46 to -1, P=0.044), and VCAM (-6%, -12 to -0.1 P=0.046), ICAM (-8%, -16 to 0.3, P=0.058), and tPA (-1.08 ng/mL, -2.09 to -0.07, P=0.036). The exercising participants also had reduced cIMT (-0.024 mm, -0.044 to -0.005, P=0.015). No changes were observed in the liraglutide vs. non-liraglutide-treated participants.

**Conclusion:**
Exercise, but not incretin-based therapy, decreased ath- erosclerosis development during weight loss maintenance. Since both exercise and incretin-based treatment maintained weight loss, this sug- gests that exercise plays a key role in mitigating cardiovascular risk factors in a weight-independent manner.

**The effect of fenofibrate on progression of diabetic retinopathy according to background statin use and retinopathy grading**

V. Silva, Group

**Background and aims:**
The randomised placebo-controlled LENS trial demonstrated that fenofibrate therapy reduces the progression of diabetic retinopathy. There is clinical interest in knowing whether the benefit of fenofibrate treatment is consistent according to background statin use and also based on the severity of retinopathy.

**Materials and methods:**
We recruited and followed adults with non- referable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy using the national Dia- betic Eye Screening (DES) program in Scotland in the LENS trial. We randomised participants to receive 145-mg nanoparticle fenofibrate tablets or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of develop- ing referable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy (defined using the DES grading scheme) or treatment (intravitreal injection, retinal laser, vitrectomy) for retinopathy or maculopathy. We tested for statistical heterogeneity according to (i) the use of statin therapy at baseline, and (ii) retinopathy grading at baseline (defined as mild disease [i.e. bilateral R1M0 or lower grading] or moderate disease [i.e. any R2 or M1 grading]).

**Results:**
We randomised 1151 participants and they were followed for a median of 4.0 years. Overall, 74% of participants were treated with statin therapy, and 11% had moderate retinopathy or maculopathy. As previously reported, progression to referable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy, or treatment thereof, was proportionally reduced by 27% by fenofibrate therapy compared to placebo. The proportional benefit of fenofibrate therapy was similar in participants treated vs. not treated with statins (p-value for heterogeneity 0.66) and also in participants with mild vs. moderate eye disease (p-value for heterogeneity 0.25) (see Table). The absolute benefit was higher in participants with moderate (14.8%) than in those with mild (5.4%) retinopathy or maculopathy.

**Conclusion:**
Fenofibrate provides consistent benefit to patients with non-referable diabetic retinopathy regardless of background statin use or retinopathy grading.

**Background and aims:**
The transition from standard to hybrid closed loop insulin pumps (HCL) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can be associated with paradoxical early worsening of diabetic retinopa- thy (DR), due to the risk of rapid improvement in glycaemic control. In England, within the National Health Service, the retinal screening programme runs separate from routine diabetes care with different timelines for DR screening. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of early worsening of DR with newer automated insulin devices (AID) during the upgrade from standard pump to HCL.

**Materials and methods:**
All patients with T1D who transitioned from standard pump to HCL at our centre were assessed. Most recent HbA1c levels and DR status on standard pump and next available data after HCL initiation (at least 3 months after transition) were collated. Patients who were pregnant, and individuals with lack of HbA1c or retinal screening records were excluded. DR was classified as back- ground (BDR), non-proliferative (NPDR) or proliferative (PDR), with or without maculopathy (M) based on the worst eye.

**Results:**
N=67. (mean): Age 46.5 years (18-85); 64% were females; duration of T1D 29.5 years (6-67); duration on standard pump 8 years (1-19); HbA1c 61mmol/mol (38-87). Baseline DR status: no DR 21; BDR 33; PDR 2. 14 patients had co-existent maculopathy. 12 patients were under retinal clinic review for closer surveillance and/or active ongoing treatment. : Mean HbA1c was 57mmol/mol (35-89). 49/67 patients had reduc- tion in HbA1c with HCL: mean reduction was 8mmol/mol (1-33). DR screening was done 199 days after HCL initiation. DR progressed in 7, remained stable in 39 and improved in 3 patients. Age, duration of T1D and baseline HbA1c did not predict progression. 4 patients had progression: unilateral BDR in 1, bilateral BDR from no DR in 2 and referable maculopathy requir- ing no treatment in 1 patient. Mean reduction in HbA1c of 8mmol/ mol. 3 needed new laser treat- ment, mean reduction in HbA1c of 5mmol/mol and likely related to pre-existent DR. Amongst the 18/67 patients with stable or worsening HbA1c levels, 2 patients developed referable maculopathy (managed conservatively).

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the typical risk factor distribution for early worsening of DR in patients with T1D commenced on HCL at a tertiary centre: the significantly high duration of T1D of 29 years, pre-existent DR in 69% and consistent reduction in HbA1c in 73% with an inherent risk that this could be rapid and significant. 14% of patients with HbA1c reduction had DR progression. It is imperative that ongoing continued collaboration with retinal ophthalmology teams are required, to ensure appropriate surveillance safeguards are in place to monitor for progression of DR, especially with the AID systems being programmed for fixed target ranges. The ramifications for DR screening with HCL initiation needs to be encompassed in manage- ment protocols along the same lines as is warranted for standard pump initiation from prior multiple daily insulin injections.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major compli- cation of diabetes mellitus and a leading cause of blindness globally. Early detection and intervention underpin optimal DR management and remain challenging. The underlying biological mechanisms are also poorly understood. This study examined comprehensive plasma lipid profiles using a targeted approach to detect potential DR biomarkers.

**Materials and methods:**
We utilised data and samples from 762 adult participants with type 2 diabetes (mean age 64.5 years, 54.3% males, median diabetes duration 7.0 years) from the community-based longi- tudinal Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II. All had DR status (none, mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), moderate NPDR, or severe NPDR or worse) assessed by colour fundus photography at baseline and at the Year 4 or 6 review. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used for plasma lipid profiling using baseline samples. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify baseline associates of i) any new or worsening DR and ii) any incident DR. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) was used to evaluate the incremental contribution of potential new lipid biomarkers. The net reclassification improvement (NRI) was also calculated.

**Results:**
Any new/worsening DR was observed in 121 participants (16%) and 35 of 495 without DR at baseline (7.0%) developed DR during follow-up. We detected five lipids independently associated with one or both DR outcomes, specifically cholesterol ester (20:4), fatty acid (20:3), lysophosphatidylglycerol (18:0), lysophosphatidylglycerol (18:1) and phosphatidylcholine (18:0_20:3). For any new/worsening DR, the inclusion of lipid parameters (cholesterol ester (20:4), fatty acid (20:3) and lysophosphatidylglycerol (18:1)) in addition to con- ventional risk factors (systolic hypertension, ­HbA , blood glucose- lowering treatment intensity and urinary albumin:creatinine) added significantly to the conventional model (LRT, =0.00002). The NRI gain for at a moderate cut-off of 10% was 5.7% (SE 2.8%; =0.043). For incident DR, inclusion of lipid parameters (fatty acid (20:3), lysophosphatidylglycerol (18:0) and phosphatidylcholine (18:0_20:3)) with ­HbA as the only conventional risk factor improved model per- formance (LRT, =0.00001). The NRI gain at a moderate cut-off of 5% risk of incident DR was 28.3% ( =0.002).

**Conclusion:**
These data demonstrate that disturbances in lipid metab- olism are associated with DR progression in type 2 diabetes. The present five lipid biomarkers have not been identified as determinants of incident DR in limited previous longitudinal studies but have the potential to improve DR risk prediction and provide novel insights into the mechanistic pathways underlying the development and pro- gression of DR.

**Background and aims:**
Inflammatory processes are implicated in dia- betic retinopathy (DR) pathogenesis. Prior studies suggest that systemic inflammatory biomarkers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and soluble CD163, may be associated with DR. However, prospec- tive data evaluating their predictive potential for DR development and progression in individuals with type 2 diabetes are limited. This study aimed to investigate whether these biomarkers are associated with DR incidence and progression in a cohort of individuals with recently diag- nosed type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
A prospective cohort from the Danish Cen- tre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2) had circulating concentrations of hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-α, and soluble CD163 measured at enrolment. DR status was obtained from the Danish Registry of Diabetic Retinopathy and classified using the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale. Progression was defined as a worsening of at least one severity level in both eyes or a two-level worsening in one eye. Follow-up continued until DR diagnosis, pro- gression, death, emigration, or the end of the study period (May 2024). Logistic regression evaluated associations between biomarker levels and prevalent DR at enrolment. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed associations between biomarker quartiles and incident DR, progression, or a combined endpoint (incident or progression), adjusted for diabetes duration, HbA1c, renal function (eGFR, UACR), blood pressure, lipid levels, and medication use.

**Results:**
Among 3,363 participants (58.1% men; median age 61.2 years; median diabetes duration 1.1 years), DR was present at enrol- ment in 272 individuals (8.1%). During a median follow-up of nine years, new DR occurred in 430 participants (13.9% of 3,091 initially DR-free) and DR progression occurred in 126 (46.3% of 272 with base- line DR). No significant associations were observed between baseline inflammatory biomarker concentrations and DR presence, incidence, progression, or the combined endpoint. Comparing the highest to low- est quartiles, adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for DR presence at base- line were: hsCRP 0.71 (0.45-1.10), IL-6 1.07 (0.71-1.64), TNF-α 0.90 (0.59-1.36), and CD163 1.01 (0.67-1.52). Adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for DR incidence were: hsCRP 0.83 (0.60-1.15), IL-6 1.17 (0.85- 1.62), TNF-α 0.94 (0.68-1.29), and CD163 0.89 (0.65-1.22). For DR progression, adjusted hazard ratios were: hsCRP 0.78 (0.52-1.18), IL-6 0.98 (0.65-1.48), TNF-α 0.91 (0.60-1.39), and CD163 0.74 (0.49-1.11). For the combined endpoint, adjusted hazard ratios were: hsCRP 0.76 (0.56-1.04), IL-6 1.04 (0.77-1.42), TNF-α 0.83 (0.61-1.13), and CD163 0.86 (0.64-1.16). Neither age, sex, HbA1c levels, nor diabetes duration modified these associations,

**Conclusion:**
This study did not demonstrate that systemic inflamma- tory biomarkers are predictive of DR presence, incidence or progres- sion in early-stage type 2 diabetes. These findings contrast with prior cross-sectional studies suggesting a role for systemic low-grade inflam- mation in DR development.

**Background and aims:**
Severe diabetic retinopathy (SDR), a lead- ing cause of vision impairment in individuals with diabetes, typically progresses over an extended period. Both environmental and genetic factors influence SDR, but so far only a few genetic variants have been identified. Given the gradual progression of SDR, survival analysis models provide a more appropriate framework for understanding the genetic underpinnings of SDR compared to traditional cross-sectional genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This study aims to identify genetic risk factors for SDR in type 1 diabetes (T1D) through both standard GWAS and survival analysis GWAS in the FinnDiane Study.

**Materials and methods:**
The study population consisted of 2,737 T1D cases with SDR and 3,020 T1D controls without SDR. SDR was defined as the first laser treatment (retinal photocoagulation) event, or a diagnosis code for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, based on participant interviews, medical and ophthalmic records, and the Finn- ish Hospital Discharge Registry until the end of 2020. Based on the most recent available data, controls were defined as individuals who have never developed SDR (ETDRS score <60). The samples were genotyped with Illumina HumanCoreExome Bead arrays and imputa- tion performed based on the population-specific SISu v3 imputation reference panel. A standard GWAS was performed with the Firth test using Regenie software and variants were filtered with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.1 %. Survival analysis GWAS was performed with the Cox proportional hazard regression model and Firth correction using Regenie v4.0. Diabetes duration was used as a time variable and SDR as the event. Both models were adjusted for age at diabetes onset, sex, and four genetic principal components, with a subsequent analysis incorporating weighted mean HbA1c.

**Results:**
In the GWAS of SDR, seven genomic regions with p-values < 1×10 were identified as potential risk loci. Notably, the rs147155553 near the gene (MAF = 2%; = 5.1×10 ) approached genome- wide significance and remained suggestively significant when adjust- ing for HbA1c. Survival analysis GWAS identified two loci with p-values < 1×10 , including a genome-wide significant association with rs534541023 in (MAF = 0.1%; = 2.2×10 . The significance of this variant persisted after adjusting for HbA1c, sug- gesting a potential role of this non-coding RNA in modulating the risk of SDR over time.

**Conclusion:**
This study discovered a close to significant variant near the gene encoding for endothelin-3. The endothelins, particu- larly endothelin-1, are thought to contribute to vascular endothelial dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, survival analy- sis identified as a potential key factor influencing the long-term risk of SDR, reinforcing the importance of time-to-event models in genetic studies of progressive diseases like diabetic retinopa- thy. regulates the expression of the gene which is involved in synaptic function in various types of retinal neurons.

**Background and aims:**
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that exerts its biological effects through a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in multiple tissues, including the pancreas, kidneys, lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Synthetic GLP-1 ana- logs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), are widely used in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Beyond their metabolic benefits, emerging evidence suggests that GLP-1RAs possess anti- inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, conflicting reports indicate that these agents may also exacerbate diabetic retinopathy. This study aimed to examine the effects of GLP-1RAs on retinal epi- thelial cells within a diabetic environment, focusing on their potential to enhance antioxidant defense mechanisms.

**Materials and methods:**
Human retinal endothelial cells (HREC, P10880; Innoprot) were treated with varying concentrations of sema- glutide (0-45 pg/ml) for 24 hours. To simulate a diabetic environment, oxidative stress was induced using hydrogen peroxide ­(H O ) in con- junction with elevated glucose levels (30 mg/dl). Cell viability and proliferation were assessed using standard assays. Apoptosis levels were evaluated through immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Confocal microscopy was employed to visualize mitochondrial super- oxide production and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) under oxidative stress and following GLP-1RAs treatment. The molecular mechanisms of GLP-1RAs bioactivity were elucidated by analyzing the relative expression levels of genes involved in oxidative response and apoptosis.

**Results:**
Treatment with GLP-1RAs significantly improved cell via- bility and intracellular ATP levels in HRECs exposed to a diabetic milieu, compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Moreover, GLP-1RA administration markedly reduced apoptosis, mitochondrial superoxide production, and the accumulation of AGEs (p < 0.001). Gene expres- sion analysis demonstrated upregulation of antioxidant-related genes and concurrent downregulation of apoptosis-associated genes. Notably, GLP-1RA treatment led to a 50% increase in the expression of key transcription factors compared to controls (p < 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
These findings indicate that GLP-1RAs exert potent anti- oxidant effects in vitro, markedly enhancing the viability of HRECs under diabetic conditions. By attenuating apoptosis and reducing mito- chondrial superoxide production and AGEs, GLP-1RAs provide signifi- cant protection against diabetes-induced cellular damage. The observed upregulation of antioxidant gene expression further supports their role in promoting cellular resilience. Importantly, the study did not reveal any direct cytotoxic effects of semaglutide on retinal cells. On the con- trary, the results underscore the therapeutic potential of GLP-1RAs in safeguarding retinal integrity, highlighting their promise in mitigating diabetic retinal complications and preserving ocular health.

7. Research at Medical City, Dallas, TX, USA, University of Alabama

**Background and aims:**
Anthropometric measures are increasingly used for risk identification, impact evaluation and population research in obesity medicine. Obesity medications (OMs) can lead to improve- ments in anthropometric measures such as BMI, waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), which are markers of meta- bolic health. Some individuals may not reach their health goals and may benefit from greater weight reduction to improve health. This analysis investigated changes in anthropometric measures of obesity with semaglutide (sema) 7.2 mg in the STEP UP trial.

**Materials and methods:**
In this phase 3b, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multicentre trial, adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m without type 2 diabetes were randomised 5:1:1 to once-weekly s. c. sema 7.2 mg, sema 2.4 mg, or placebo (pbo), and lifestyle interventions for 72 weeks. Secondary endpoints from baseline to week 72 included: proportions of participants (pts) achieving a BMI threshold <27 kg/m (with addi- tional post hoc analysis of <25 kg/m and <30 kg/m thresholds and BMI category shifts); change in WC; post hoc analysis of proportion of pts achieving a clinically meaningful WHtR of <0.50. Data are from the in-trial period and treatment policy estimand. Statistics presented for BMI category shifts are descriptive; for other analyses, an unad- justed two-sided p value for test of no difference was used.

**Results:**
Overall, pts (sema 7.2 mg n=1005; sema 2.4 mg n=201; pbo n=201) had baseline mean (SD) body weight: 113.0 (24.1) kg; BMI: 39.9 (7.1) kg/m ; WC: 118.7 (15.8) cm; WHtR: 0.71 (0.09). Sema 7.2 mg and 2.4 mg had favourable shifts in BMI categories from baseline to week 72 compared with pbo (Fig A). A greater proportion of pts in the sema 7.2 mg vs 2.4 mg group achieved the BMI threshold (esti- mated treatment ratio [ETR] [95% CI]) of <25 kg/m (2.1 [1.2, 3.4]; p=0.006), <27 kg/m (1.6 [1.1, 2.2]; p=0.013), with a trend for <30 kg/m (1.3 [1.0, 1.7]; p=0.059). Sema 7.2 mg was superior to pbo in achieving these BMI thresholds (sema 7.2 mg vs pbo; all p≤0.0001) (Fig B). Pts in the sema 7.2 mg, 2.4 mg and pbo groups had mean reductions in WC of −17.5 cm, −14.6 cm and −5.9 cm, respectively (sema 7.2 mg vs 2.4 mg, estimated treatment difference −2.9 [95% CI −4.6, −1.3; p=0.0004). At week 72, a greater estimated proportion of pts treated with sema 7.2 mg (14.6%) achieved WHtR <0.50, compared with 2.4 mg (6.5%) and pbo (1.1%) (sema 7.2 mg vs 2.4 mg, ETR 2.5 [95% CI 1.4, 4.3]; p=0.0014).

**Conclusion:**
Treatment with sema 7.2 mg improved anthropometric measures of obesity more than sema 2.4 mg, with a greater proportion of pts achieving clinically meaningful targets, such as WHtR <0.50, compared with pbo.

In this phase 3 RCT, adults with BMI ≥30 kg/ m without T2D were randomised (5:1:1) to once-weekly s.c. sema 7.2 mg, 2.4 mg or placebo (pbo), plus lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Prespecified exploratory endpoints were the assessment of changes in Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ; 19 items within 4 domains: craving control, positive mood, craving for sweet, craving for savoury) and Three-Factor-Eating Ques- tionnaire revised 18-item version 2 (TFEQ-R18v2; items within 3 scales: cognitive restraint, emotional eating, uncontrolled eating) scores. Data are for the in-trial period and treatment policy estimand.

**Results:**
Body weight loss was significantly greater with sema 7.2 mg (18.7%) vs 2.4 mg (15.6%) and pbo (3.9%); with treatment differences of −3.1% and −14.8% (both p<0.001). Across CoEQ domains, scores were improved by sema 7.2 mg and 2.4 mg vs pbo at week 24. At week 72, there was a significantly greater change in mean (95% CI) craving control score for sema 7.2 mg vs pbo (0.5 [0.0, 1.0]; p<0.05) (Fig A). There were also significant (p<0.05) improvements with sema 7.2 mg vs pbo in individual CoEQ items, including those relating to hunger and fullness, and cravings related to starchy, salty and spicy foods. There were no significant differences between sema 7.2 mg vs sema 2.4 mg for most CoEQ items except for cravings related to fruit or fruit juice, and salty and spicy foods in favour of sema 7.2 mg. TFEQ-R18v2 scores improved overall at week 24 and remained improved at week 72. At week 72, sig- nificantly greater mean improvements were observed in emotional eating (−6.6 [−10.3, −2.8]; p 0.001) with sema 7.2 mg vs pbo and uncontrolled eating (−6.3 [−9.5, −3.1]; p<0.001) with sema 7.2 mg vs pbo; whereas there was only a significant difference in uncontrolled eating (−3.7 [−7.2, −0.1]; p<0.05) for sema 7.2 mg vs sema 2.4 mg (Fig B).

**Conclusion:**
In adults with obesity, in addition to substantial weight loss, sema 7.2 mg vs pbo provided long-term improvements in aspects of eating control, particularly regarding craving control, emotional eating, uncontrolled eating and disordered eating patterns

**Background and aims:**
Semaglutide (sema) treatment results in substantial weight loss in adults with overweight and obesity. In this analysis we investigated the changes in body composition and muscle strength as a result of sema-induced weight loss.

**Materials and methods:**
In this phase 3b RCT, adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m without T2D were randomized 5:1:1 to once-weekly s.c. sema 7.2 mg, sema 2.4 mg, or placebo (pbo), as an adjunct to a lifestyle intervention for 72 weeks. A subpopulation had MRI scans performed to assess body composition, measuring total adipose tis- sue (AT) volume (comprising subcutaneous and visceral AT [VAT]) and lean tissue (LT) volume (comprising non-AT components) from the knees to vertebra T9. Changes from baseline to week 72 in % body weight and body composition parameters (absolute [litres; L], % volume of total AT, VAT, and LT; and AT:LT volume ratio) were measured. AT and LT volumes were converted to mass (kg) by mul- tiplying volume by respective tissue densities of 0.92 and 1.1. A sit-to-stand test (number of repetitions in 30 s) was performed to assess muscle strength. All data are from MRI participants (pts) in the in-trial period and treatment policy estimand, and pooled for the sema groups.

**Results:**
Overall, pts with MRI scans (pooled sema n=49; pbo n=6) had mean baseline body weight of 110.8 kg. Pts in the sema and pbo groups had baseline tissue volumes of: AT 42.9 L vs 47.1 L; VAT 5.4 L vs 5.1 L; and LT 23.8 L vs 24.5 L. Pts in the sema group had greater % body weight loss compared with the pbo group (estimated treatment difference [ETD] −16.5% [95% CI −26.3, −6.8]; p=0.0009), and greater absolute reductions in total AT volume (ETD −11.1 L [−16.5, −5.7]; p<0.001) and visceral AT volume (ETD −1.5 L [−2.9, −0.1]; p=0.042). Absolute LT volume declined in the sema group with no significant difference vs pbo (ETD: −1.7 L [95% CI −4.0, 0.7]; p=0.164) (Fig A). These corresponded to estimated mass reductions of 10.2 kg, 1.4 kg, and 1.9 kg, for AT, VAT, and LT, and the frac- tions of weight lost from total AT mass and lean mass were 84.5% and 15.5%, respectively. Similar results were seen for % change from baseline in AT, VAT, and LT volume (Fig B). Pts in the sema group had more favourable shifts from baseline to week 72 in AT:LT volume ratio (1.80 to 1.35), compared with pbo (1.93 to 1.85). There were no differences between sema and pbo in the change from baseline in number of repetitions performed in the sit-to-stand test (ETD −0.1 [−3.6, 3.4]; p=0.97).

**Conclusion:**
Weight loss associated with sema treatment was accom- panied by clinically important reductions in total AT and VAT, with a small fraction of weight lost from LT, alongside preserved sit-to-stand capability.

3. Canada, Copenhagen, Denmark, EY, Frederiksberg, Denmark, Depart-

**Background and aims:**
The phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled SELECT trial demonstrated the efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg for reducing secondary cardiovascular (CV) events in people living with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥27 kg/m ) and CVD, without diabetes. Here, we examined CV outcomes associated with semaglutide for weight management in a broader, real-world population (without diabetes but with no restriction by CVD), in Danish hospital records.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a retrospective cohort study of people aged ≥45 years with hospital-diagnosed overweight/obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m ) identified using ICD-10 diagnosis codes in the Danish National Patient Register (1 Jan 2012-31 Dec 2022). People who redeemed ≥1 prescription for once-weekly semaglutide for weight management, iden- tified in the Danish Prescription Register (12 Dec 2022-31 Oct 2024), were matched on demographic and clinical characteristics to people with no registered filled semaglutide prescription in the same period. Index date was the date of first filled semaglutide prescription; the same index date was used for matched controls. End of follow-up was 8 Dec 2024, migration or outcome of interest, whichever occurred first. Outcomes were time to 5-point major adverse cardiovascular events (5P-MACE; composite of myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, coronary revascularization, all-cause mortality), and time to 3-point (3P)-MACE (composite of MI, stroke, all-cause mortality). A Cox proportional hazards model was used to generate HRs and 95% CIs to compare the semaglutide and non-semaglutide groups.

**Results:**
In total, 7113 people in the semaglutide group were matched to 21,339 controls. In both groups, 84% were women, 15% had overweight, 38% had obesity class I, 25% had obesity class II and 22% had obesity class III. Mean age was 57.3 years (SD, 8.5) in the semaglutide group and 57.7 years (SD, 9.0) in the non-semaglutide group. The groups were well-matched on socioeconomic factors, comorbidities, and pre-index procedures and medications. Mean follow up was 13.5 months (SD, 6.8). The semaglutide group experienced fewer 5P-MACE events than the non-semaglutide group (incidence per 1000 person years, 12.8 vs 20.2; absolute risk reduction 7.4). The same was observed for 3P-MACE (7.4 vs 14.0; 6.6). The semaglutide group was at lower risk of 5P-MACE than the non-semaglutide group (event rates, 1.4% vs 2.3%; HR, 0.64 [95% CI: 0.51-0.79]); the same was observed for 3P-MACE (0.8% vs 1.6%; 0.53 [0.40-0.70]). The Figure shows survival curves.

**Conclusion:**
For Danish individuals with overweight or obesity identi- fied using hospital records, once-weekly semaglutide was associated with a reduced risk of CV outcomes over 13 months.

**Bimagrumab prevents semaglutide-induced muscle mass loss in diet-induced obese mice**

M. Tozzi, H.B. Hansen

**Background and aims:**
Rapid weight loss can result in sarcope- nia, a condition characterized by reduced muscle mass and muscle strength. Accordingly, semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) effec- tively reduces body weight but also decreases muscle mass in obese individuals. Because maintained muscle mass is important for healthy metabolism and better quality of life especially in the elderly popu- lation, it is important to identify medications that can counteract or minimize this undesirable effect of weight-lowering drugs. The present study aimed to evaluate if bimagrumab (therapeutic antibody target- ing activin type II receptors which are negative regulators of muscle growth) can prevent semaglutide-induced sarcopenia in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (60 kcal-% fat) for 26 weeks. DIO mice were randomized to treatment based on body weight and whole-body fat mass, and administered (SC) vehicle, semaglutide (30 nmol/kg, QD), human bimagrumab (20 mg/ kg, QW) or semaglutide + bimagrumab (30 nmol/kg, QD + 20 mg/ kg, QW) for 4 weeks (n=10 per group). Chow-fed mice served as lean controls. Endpoints included body weight, food intake, whole-body fat/ lean mass (echoMRI), grip strength, muscle weight, plasma biomark- ers (including urinary D3-creatine/creatinine) and quantitative muscle histology.

**Results:**
Semaglutide reduced food intake, body weight, fat and lean mass in DIO mice. Bimagrumab increased lean mass per se and pre- vented loss of muscle mass while maintaining significant weight loss and reduced adiposity in semaglutide-treated DIO mice. These out- comes were supported by beneficial effects of bimagrumab on skeletal muscle markers.

**Conclusion:**
Bimagrumab prevents semaglutide-induced sarcopenia in DIO mice, implicating activin type II receptors in the adverse effects of weight loss drugs on muscle mass. Bimagrumab may serve as refer- ence compound in DIO mouse and aged-DIO mouse studies aiming to profile potential drug candidates with therapeutic potential to prevent anti-obesity drug-induced sarcopenia.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity management is challenged by weight regain, often worsening glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes mel- litus (T2DM). While GLP1-receptor agonists are effective for weight management, their role in weight loss maintenance is less studied. In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated whether com- bining the GLP1-receptor agonist semaglutide with a lifestyle interven- tion improves long-term glycemic control, weight loss, and metabolic outcomes in individuals with obesity and T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
We investigated the efficacy of once-weekly s. c. administered semaglutide 1.0 mg vs placebo for weight mainte- nance following an initial 8-week low-calorie diet (LCD). Adults with T2DM (n = 20, BMI ≥27 kg/m², age 35-64 years) first participated in an 8-week LCD. Upon completion, participants were randomized 1:1 into semaglutide 1.0 mg or placebo for a 10-month weight maintenance phase with continued lifestyle support. The primary outcome was the change in hemoglobin ­A ­(HbA ) from baseline to 12 months. Sec- ondary outcomes included percentage weight loss, body composition, biomarkers of glucose and lipid metabolism, and hs-CRP. Outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression models.

**Results:**
At baseline, the mean ± SD ­HbA across both groups was 48.7 ± 8.2 mmol/mol and mean weight 101.8 ± 20.3 kg. After the LCD, there was no significant difference between groups regarding ­HbA (37.5 ± 10.2 mmol/mol) or weight (93.0 ± 19.3 kg). None of the participants discontinued treatment or dropped out. At 12 months, ­HbA decreased by -15.7 mmol/mol (95% CI: -19.5 to -11.9) with semaglutide and -6.0 (95% CI: -9.8 to -2.1) with placebo, with an esti- mated treatment difference (ETD) between the groups of -9.7 (95% CI: -15.1 to -4.3, p = 0.002). Among secondary outcomes, fasting glucose decreased -3.3 mmol/L with semaglutide, and -1.6 mmol/L with pla- cebo, ETD -1.7 mmol/L (95% CI, -3.0 to -0.5, p = 0.010). Body weight decreased by -15.1 vs -7.3 kg, ETD -7.9 kg (95% CI: -13.4 to -2.4, p = 0.010), with corresponding percentages of weight loss 15.1% vs -7.3%, ETD -7.8% (95% CI: -12.8 to -2.9, p = 0.005). Body fat percentage decreased -6.4 in the semaglutide group vs -2.5% in the placebo group, ETD -3.9% (95% CI: -6.8 to -1.0, p = 0.013), total body fat mass by -12.3 vs -5.4 kg, ETD -7.0 kg (95% CI: -11.6 to -2.4, p = 0.007), and fat free mass by -2.5 vs -1.2 kg, ETD -1.3 kg (95% CI: -2.6 to -0.1, p = 0.041). At 12 months, no significant between group differences were observed for lipids, blood pressure, or inflammation (hs-CRP).

**Conclusion:**
In this 1-year trial in participants with T2DM and obesity, add-on semaglutide treatment during a lifestyle intervention improved long-term blood glucose control and promoted greater weight loss com- pared to placebo. These changes extended to body composition, with a greater loss of body fat in the semaglutide group.

**Global patterns of prediabetes from 1990-2023: a systematic analy- sis of the Global Burden of Disease study**

Y.Y. Xu

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes prevalence has increased globally in the last 3 decades and is projected to continue to rise through 2050. It is ranked as one of the top 10 diseases causing disability and death. Despite this, the transitional phase into the disease - prediabetes - is often overlooked by policymakers and researchers. Prediabetes is associated with increased risk of developing diseases such as diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and dementia. There is also a lack of compre- hensive data to evaluate the scale of the problem throughout the world, thus limiting opportunities for development of public health guidelines and promoting early prevention and intervention. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of prediabetes in 204 countries and territories for males and females separately and combined from 1990 to 2023 in ages 25 and above.

**Materials and methods:**
We define prediabetes as Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) between 6.1-6.9 mmol/L based on WHO. We used 2749 data sources from 174 countries that had either reported mean FPG or prevalence of diabetes. We created models to predict the distribution of FPG by age, year, sex, and location using mean FPG and standard deviation. We used an ensemble of 10 distribution types to create the shape of the distribution and optimized the right tail to fit the preva- lence of diabetes. We then integrated the area under the distribution to obtain the prevalence of prediabetes for each unique demographic strata over time.

**Results:**
In 2023, there were 658 million (95% UI 442 - 930) people with prediabetes in the world, an age-standardized prevalence of 13.6% (95% UI: 0.91-19.4%). Global prediabetes rates were high- est in ages 50-54 (16.9%, 95% UI: 11.5-22.8) and lowest in ages 25-29 (8.2%, 95% UI: 4.8-14.5%). The prevalence of pre-diabetes substantially varied across the globe from 5.4% (95% UI: 3.8-8.1%) in Eastern Sub-saharan Africa to 21.3% (95% UI: 12.1 - 27.2%) in Tropical Latin America. The age standardized prevalence in Western Europe, Central Europe and Eastern Europe were 18.4% (95% UI: 0.90-27.3%), 14.9% (11.8-18.2%) and 12.3% (95% UI: 6.6 - 23.0 %), respectively. Between 1990 to 2023, there was a 10.7 % (95% UI: -43.4 - 95.7%) increase in the age standardized rate of people with prediabetes, with largest increases in ages below 45. Changes between 1990 to 2023 in age standardized prevalence rates also vary substantially across the world, leading with largest increases of 98.7% (95% UI: -12.8-340.6%) in Australasia. All, but 11 of the 204 countries had an increase in age standardized prevalence since 1990.

**Conclusion:**
Prediabetes affects all ages and is continuing to rise around the world especially in younger adults. This calls for attention on early screening and intervention to identify prediabetes, which may prevent or delay progression into diabetes in later life. Broader policies that target modifiable risk factors in these ages to improve overall health require more attention.

1. University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, Finnish Institute for
3. Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland, University of Eastern Fin-

**Background and aims:**
Lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss has been shown to improve glucose metabolism and induce remission in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and those with impaired glu- cose tolerance (IGT). Remission has been associated with a reduced risk of progression from IGT to T2D. However, long-term results on the efficacy of weight loss and subsequent remission are scarce. We examined the long-term remission of IGT among the participants in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS) and the impact of remission on T2D incidence. Additionally, we assessed factors con- tributing to remission during the extended follow-up.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 505 people with IGT at base- line comprised the DPS study population. On average, the lifestyle intervention period lasted for 4 years. The study participants were followed for up to 25 years (median 8 years). The data were col- lected annually or biennially, depending on the follow-up period. The primary outcome measure for remission was the normalization of glucose tolerance. Furthermore, we examined the extent to which potential predictive factors such as weight loss, and changes in waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, insulin sensitivity, and first-phase insulin secretion (based on repeated oral glucose tolerance tests) were associated with the remission.

**Results:**
The remission was 13% at year 1, 12% at year 3, and 11% at the first post-intervention follow-up visit. After adjustments, weight loss, reductions in waist circumference and sagittal abdominal diam- eter, improved insulin sensitivity, and recovery of first-phase insulin secretion were independent predictors for remission. The cumulative hazards (HRs) were reduced in the people in remission at each evalu- ation time point. The hazard ratio for T2D by remission at year 1 was 0.412 (95% CI 0.281-0.604), at year 3 it was 0.398 (0.250-0.633), and at the first post-intervention follow-up it was 0.199 (0.081-0.491) This implies that the risk of T2D remained lower in the remission group long after the initial time of the remission status evaluation.

**Conclusion:**
Multifactorial lifestyle intervention, with weight loss as one of the primary goals, may normalize IGT long-term. Improved insulin sensitivity and recovering insulin secretion also contribute to remission in people with IGT, which is related to a reduced T2D incidence.

7. London, UK, University Hospital Aachen, Aachen, Germany.

**Background and aims:**
Prediabetes increases the risk of atheroscle- rotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF). Lifestyle interventions (LI), including diet and physical activity for weight loss, are recommended, though their long-term impact on cardiovascular (CV) events remains unclear. A novel strategy focuses on prediabe- tes remission, restoring normal glucose regulation (NGR; FPG<5.6 mmol/L, 2-h OGTT<7.8 mmol/L, HbA1c <39 mmol/mol), which is more effective in preventing type 2 diabetes (T2D) than conventional approaches. We hypothesized that prediabetes remission reduces CV events

**Materials and methods:**
Using the NIDDK repository data, we con- ducted a post-hoc analysis from the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPPOS, US) and a confirmatory analysis from the DaQing Diabetes Prevention Outcome Study (DQDPOS, China) to assess long-term CV outcomes in individuals with prediabetes achiev- ing prediabetes remission after LI. The primary endpoint was the well- established composite of CV death or heart failure (HF) hospitaliza- tion. DPPOS included up to 21 years of follow-up, and DQDPOS provided up to 30 years. Remission to NGR was defined per ADA criteria (DPPOS) and WHO criteria (DQDPOS) for sensitivity analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare outcome risks between the remission and non-remission groups. Fully adjusted mod- els included sex, race/ethnicity, treatment assignment, baseline age, baseline weight, baseline smoking status, baseline use of antihyperten- sives, baseline use of statins and time-dependent diabetes as covariates.

**Results:**
In DPPOS (N=2,402 people with prediabetes), after one year of intervention, 275 (11%) achieved remission, and 2,127 (89%) did not. Over 20 years, the event rate for CV death or HF hospitalization was 1.74 (95% CI 0.87-3.48) per 1000 person-years in the remission group vs. 4.19 (95% CI 3.56-4.92) per 1000 person-years in non- remitters (p=0.013). The crude and fully adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were 0.41 (95% CI 0.20-0.84, p=0.014) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.20-0.88, p=0.021), respectively. In DQDPOS (N=540 with prediabetes), 93 participants (17%) achieved remission, while 447 (83%) did not. The all-cause mortality rate was 16.8 (95% CI 12.0-23.4) per 1000 person- years in remitters vs. 29.5 (95% CI 26.1-33.3) per 1000 person-years in non-remitters (p<0.001). The fully adjusted HR for all-cause mortality was 0.57 (95% CI 0.39-0.79, p=0.005), and 0.45 (95% CI 0.34-0.86, p=0.001) for CV death or HF hospitalization.

**Conclusion:**
In contrast to conventional therapeutic targets for pre- diabetes, prediabetes remission is associated with a significant reduc- tion in CV morbidity and mortality, with a strong legacy effect lasting >20 years across ethnically diverse populations. Prediabetes remission should be another a key target for prevention in people with prediabetes

**Background and aims:**
Prediabetes is an increasingly recognized condition preceding type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) which is also associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality. The diagnos- tic criteria for prediabetes have evolved, with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) emerging as an easy alternative to the long-established oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). However, HbA1c is influenced by vari- ous physiological factors, particularly age, which may impact its diag- nostic and prognostic utility. This study examines the impact of age on HbA1c-based prediabetes classification and its prognostic implications in two German cohorts: Ulm (2012-2023) from a German University Hospital, and LURIC (2004-2024), the Ludwigshafen Risk and Car- diovascular Health study.

**Materials and methods:**
The study consists of individuals from the Ulm and LURIC cohorts, categorized into three main groups: HbA1c- only prediabetes (n=118 Ulm, n=539 LURIC), OGTT-only prediabe- tes (n=339 Ulm, n=200 LURIC), and concordant prediabetes (n=271 Ulm, n=338 LURIC). The correlation between age and HbA1c levels was analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis. The prognostic signif- icance of prediabetes classification was determined via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard regression adjusted for age) in the LURIC cohort with a follow-up of 20 years and all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint.

**Results:**
Age and HbA1c positively correlated in both cohorts (Ulm, r=0.16, p<0.001; LURIC, r=0.43, p<0.001) and remained significant after adjusting for sex (Ulm/LURIC, p<0.001) and blood glucose (Ulm/ LURIC, p<0.001). Diagnostic discordance increased with age and a greater proportion of older individuals being classified as prediabetics based on HbA1c-only (Ulm/LURIC, p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test (p<0.001) revealed concordant T2DM (HR=1.368, CI-1.0406-1.7994, p=0.025) had the lowest survival, while the HbA1c- only prediabetes (HR=0.812, CI-0.663-0.993, p=0.043) exhibited bet- ter survival than the normal glucose regulation reference group.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings underscore the impact of age on HbA1c- based prediabetes classification, highlighting the potential for over- diagnosis in older populations. The limited prognostic utility of HbA1c-defined prediabetes suggests that age-adjusted thresholds or may enhance diagnostic accuracy. HbA1c and OGTT detect differ- ent groups of prediabetes with OGTT being the stronger predictor of all-cause mortality. This suggests that there might still be the need for OGTT in prediabetes diagnosis and risk stratification.

**Background and aims:**
Dysglycaemia, including type 2 diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance arises from a complex interplay between insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunc- tion. This study aimed to identify plasma proteins predictive of incident dysglycemia and to examine their association with future insulin sensi- tivity and beta cell function, thereby elucidating potential pathophysi- ological pathways leading to type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
In a nested case-control study within the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study cohort, we used a targeted proteomics approach (Olink Target 96 Cardiovascular II and III panels) to identify plasma proteins that predicted the development of dysglycaemia compared to those remaining normoglycaemic using logistic regression and applying a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05. Further, quantile regression was performed to identify proteins associated with insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) and beta cell function (oral disposition index) at follow-up.

**Results:**
After a median follow-up of 18.2 years (25-75 percentile: 10.7-23.5), 347 subjects developed dysglycaemia and were matched by age, sex and BMI with 347 control subjects who remained normo- glycaemic. Ten plasma proteins predicted incident dysglycemia: fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF- 21), galectin-3, galectin-4, galectin-9, interleukin-1 receptor antago- nist protein (IL-1ra), LDL receptor, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1, retinoic acid receptor responder protein 2 (RARRES2) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Conversely, lower levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) and paraoxonase 3 (PON3) were associated with an increased risk of dysglycaemia. Among these proteins, RARRES2 was linked to lower beta cell function at follow- up, while FABP4, FGF-21, IL-1ra, PON3 and t-PA were associated with lower future insulin sensitivity. In contrast, IGFBP-2 and PON3 correlated with higher future insulin sensitivity.

**Conclusion:**
This study validates prior cross-sectional findings on protein biomarkers associated with type 2 diabetes and established their predictive role in the development of dysglycaemia. Additionally, eight proteins were identified as key regulators of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction, providing novel insights into type 2 diabetes pathophysiology. These findings offer potential targets for early risk assessment and therapeutic intervention.

**Background and aims:**
The 5:2 intermittent fasting meal replacement (5:2 MR) improved glycemic control and weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).This analysis further investigated the exploratory outcomes related to body composition and abdominal fat distribution.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a single-center analysis of a rand- omized, active-controlled trial (EARLY), which enrolled overweight and obese patients with early T2DM. A total of 85 participants were randomly assigned to receive metformin (n=28), empagliflozin (n=28), or 5:2 MR (n=29) for 16 weeks. Body composition was assessed using InBody device, and the energy spectrum CT was used to measure abdominal fat distribution. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the associations between change in body mass index (BMI) and change in the exploratory outcomes.

**Results:**
Compared with the metformin and empagliflozin groups, the 5:2MR group showed the most significant reductions in BMI (least- squares mean, −3.41 kg/m2 [standard error, 0.31]), waist circumference (−8.83 cm [1.07]), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (−0.04 [0.01]), waist- to-height ratio (WHtR) (−0.05 [0.01]), body fat percentage (BF%) (−4.84% [0.66]), abdominal cross-sectional area (ACSA) (−66.05 cm2 [9.46]), subcutaneous fat area (−58.27 cm2 [5.99]), and liver-to- spleen (L/S) ratio) (0.43 [0.04]). In the 5:2 MR group, changes in BMI exhibited linear associations and significant positive correlations with changes in WHR (r=0.411, P=0.030), WHtR (r=0.635, P<0.001), BF% (r=0.528, P=0.020) and ACSA (r=0.562, P=0.003).

**Conclusion:**
The 5:2MR regimen may be more effective than met- formin and empagliflozin in improving body composition and abdomi- nal fat distribution in early T2DM, and is proposed as a therapeutic option.

**Background and aims:**
Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary strategy that confines eating occasions typically within an 8 -10 h daytime window. No trials have previously compared TRE to the standard approach of individualised dietetic guidance (IDG), on glycaemia over 12 months in people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the aim was to determine if TRE is non-inferior to IDG to improve glycaemia at 4 months with secondary outcomes of glycaemia at 12 months.

**Materials and methods:**
In a parallel group randomised controlled trial, adults with an AUSDRISK score ≥15, BMI ≥25-≤45 kg/ m and aged 35-70 y were enrolled at two Australian clinical research sites. Participants were randomised (1:1) into TRE (9-h, last eating occasion by 1900 h) or Individualised Dietetic Guidance (IDG). Each participant accessed five telehealth consultations with a dietitian at baseline, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 months (3 h total) with overnight fasting blood samples collected at 4 and 12 months. The primary outcome was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 4 months and the non-inferiority margin was set at 0.1%. Secondary outcomes were changes in HbA1c at 12 months, fasting insulin, fasting glucose at 4 and 12 months and nocturnal glucose by continuous glucose monitor (CGM) at 4 months. The primary analysis was a covariate adjusted regression with multiple imputation within the estimand framework. For secondary outcomes the significance level was 0.05 (two-sided) without adjustment for multiplicity. Data are presented as mean change with [95%CI’s].

**Results:**
Of the 247 participants who enrolled (77% females, 56 ± 9 y, 32.9 ± 4.3 kg/m ), 124 were randomised into TRE and 123 into IDG. Baseline HbA1c was 5.8 ± 0.3% (40.4 ± 3.3 mmol/mol) for TRE and 5.8 ± 0.3 (40.3 ± 3.4 mmol/mol) for IDG. At month 4, 19 participants did not attend (10 TRE, 9 IDG) and at month 12 a further 34 par- ticipants did not attend (18 TRE, 16 IDG). TRE was non-inferior to IDG for HbA1c at 4 months (-0.02% [-0.07, 0.03%] (-0.21 mmol/mol [-0.71 to 0.29 mmol/mol]); P=0.41). No between-group differences were detected in secondary outcomes at 4 or 12 months. Adverse events were transient, and generally mild (i.e., irritability, constipation).

**Conclusion:**
Time-restricted eating was not inferior to individualised dietetic guidance for glycaemic outcomes and thus is an alternative dietary option, particularly when dietetic services are difficult to access.

**Dietary carbohydrate restriction affects hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption independently of body weight loss**

N. Cimbalo, D. ­Trico, M. Chiriacò, M. ­Masoni, L. ­Sacchetta, M., ­Scozzaro, S. ­Frascerra, S. ­Gallo, G. ­Nesti, A. ­Mengozzi, L. ­Nesti, B. ­Simona, A. ­Mari, A. ­Natali

**Background and aims:**
Low-carbohydrate diets (LCD) have demon- strated short-term benefits in body weight and plasma glucose manage- ment. Preliminary evidence suggests that carbohydrate restriction may modulate hepatic glycogenolysis, duodenal glucose absorption, and peripheral glucose disposal. However, how LCD distinctly influences organ-specific glucose handling independently of body weight loss remains unclear. This study evaluated the impact of LCD compared to an energy-matched Mediterranean diet (MED) on post-load glucose metabolic fluxes in individuals with overweight.

**Materials and methods:**
In this randomized cross-over study, 20 volunteers with BMI>27 kg/m2 and without diabetes (age 53.5±7.4 years, 11 [55%] women, BMI 30.8±3.5 kg/m2) were assigned to a 4-week mild hypocaloric LCD (20% carbohydrate, 50% fat, 30% protein) and an energy-matched 4-week MED (50% carbohydrate, 20% fat, 30% protein). After each diet, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with two stable glucose isotopes (intravenous [6,6-2 H2] glucose and oral [U-13C] glucose) was performed to measure glucose metabolic fluxes, including endogenous glucose production (EGP), rate of appearance of oral glucose (RaO), and glucose clear- ance (GCl). Insulin secretion rate (ISR) was estimated by modelling C-peptide concentrations. Adherence to dietary prescriptions was evaluated by food diaries and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

**Results:**
By design, LCD and MED led to a similar small weight reduction (-2.8±2.3 and -2.7±2.4 kg, respectively, p=0.398) but differed in self-reported daily carbohydrate intake (29.7±5.3% and 47.2±6.3%, p<0.0001) and CGM-derived average glucose levels (p=0.033). Plasma glucose, insulin and ISR profiles during OGTT were similar after the two diets. EGP was more suppressed by the oral glucose load after LCD than MED (AUC 1437±341 and 1553±250 μmol ­min kg xmin, p=0.041), showing reduced hepatic resistance to portal insulin (EGP×ISR AUC 113±43 and 125±41 μmol ­min ­kg × nmol/m ×min, p=0.026). Furthermore, RaO was significantly delayed by the LCD compared with MED (time to peak 30±12 and 21±7 min, p=0.001), although not reduced over the 180-min observation (AUC 1334±580 and 1149±557 μmol ­min ­kg ×min, p=0.303). There were no differences in post-load GCl (327±93 and 339±56 ml ­min ­kg × min, p=0.134) between the two diets, even after adjustment for plasma insulin levels (GCl/Ins 5.5±3.0 and 5.2±2.2 l ­min ­kg ­pmol l×min, p=0.804).

**Conclusion:**
Dietary carbohydrate restriction potentiates the physi- ologic suppression of hepatic glucose production following an oral glucose load and delays intestinal glucose absorption in overweight individuals, without affecting peripheral glucose disposal. These adaptations may contribute to the glucometabolic benefits of LCD by mitigating postprandial glycaemic excursions.

5. laide, Australia, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, SA, Australia.

**Background and aims:**
Gastric emptying, a key determinant of post- prandial glycaemia, exhibits a substantial inter-individual variation in both health and diabetes, while the determinants of this variation remain unclear. Gastric emptying is known to be regulated by hormonal responses to small intestinal nutrient exposure, and GLP-1 has been known to slow gastric emptying. This study examined the relation- ship between gastric emptying of an oral glucose load and the plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response to a standardised intraduo- denal glucose infusion in healthy subjects.

**Materials and methods:**
42 healthy subjects (22M/20F, age: 35.0±2.0 years; BMI 24.5±0.6 kg/m ) were evaluated after an overnight fast on 2 study days, separated by ~1 week. On day 1, subjects ingested a 75g glucose drink containing 150 mg C-acetate, and both the gastric half- emptying (T50) time (breath test) and blood glucose concentrations (glucometer) were determined over 180 min. On day 2, a multilumen silicone catheter was inserted into the duodenum via an anaesthetised nostril for infusion of a standardised glucose solution (30g glucose dissolved in water to a final volume of 150 mL) from t = 0 to 30 min- utes (i.e. 4 kcal/min, 5 mL/min). Plasma total GLP-1 concentrations (MILLIPLEX) were measured at t = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120 minutes. Data are means ± SEM.

**Results:**
There was a wide range in gastric emptying of the glucose drink (T50: 39-136 minutes). The incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for blood glucose between 0-30 min was inversely related to the T50 (r = -0.33, P = 0.03, Figure 1A). The iAUC​ for plasma total GLP-1 in response to the intraduodenal glucose infusion also exhibited wide inter-individual variation ranging from 125 to 22611 pg/mL*min. There was a direct relationship between the T50 of oral glucose and the GLP-1 iAUC​ in response to intraduodenal glucose (r = 0.31, P = 0.04, Figure 1B).

**Conclusion:**
In healthy individuals, gastric emptying accounts for ini- tial variations in blood glucose after a glucose drink and is related to the magnitude of the GLP-1 response to intestinal glucose stimulation. These observations support the concept of intestinal ‘sensitivity’ to nutrients as a determinant of gastric emptying, and thereby the glycae- mic response to meals.

**Impact of breathe well-being’s structured lifestyle intervention on GLP-1 receptor agonist side effects: a 48-week observational study**

A. Kaicker

1. Breathe Well-being, Gurgaon, India, Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh,

**Background and aims:**
GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are widely used for glycemic control and weight management but are fre- quently associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, and lean mass loss, which may contribute to treatment discontinuation. While lifestyle modifications are recommended for patients on GLP-1 RAs, limited data exist on their effectiveness in reducing side effects. This study evaluates whether integrating Breathe Well-being’s Lifestyle Management (BWLSM) Program, a structured intervention comprising dietary guidance, hydration strategies, and resistance training, improves the tolerability of GLP-1 RAs over 48 weeks.

**Materials and methods:**
In this observational study, 336 participants initiating GLP-1 RA therapy were assigned equally to either a GLP-1 only group (control) receiving standard medical care or a GLP-1 + lifestyle intervention group (intervention) following BWLSM Program. The intervention included a high-protein, gut-friendly diet, hydration strategies to alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort, and supervised resist- ance training (three sessions per week) to mitigate lean mass loss. Out- comes were assessed at baseline and regular intervals throughout the study. Gastrointestinal symptoms were measured using the Gastrointes- tinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) at baseline, week 24, and week 48. Fatigue was assessed via the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) at baseline, week 24, and week 48. Lean mass and strength were evaluated at week 0 and week 48 using bioimpedance analysis (BIA), the 10-time chair rise test for lower body strength, and the gait speed test for mobility. Adherence and tolerability were assessed via percentage of participants completing 48 weeks of therapy.

**Results:**
At week 48, the control group showed a GIQLI score of 59.6 points, a decrease from 89.4 at baseline, while the intervention group showed 87.2 and 74.7 points at baseline and 48 weeks respectively, indicating reduced gastrointestinal issues compared to control (reduc- tion of 29.8 vs 8.5, p < 0.05). Fatigue severity showed a lower dif- ference in the intervention group (mean difference FSS: 5.3 vs. 0.7, p < 0.05) with control group going from total score 33.8 to 39.1 and intervention group showing a minimal increase from 34.2 to 34.9. Lean mass loss accounted for 21.8% of total weight loss in the control group and 16.4% of total weight loss in the intervention group (p < 0.05). Functional assessments to measure strength and mobility difference showed non-significant improvements in the 10-time chair rise test performance (0.9 seconds, p > 0.05) and gait speeds (0.08 m/s, p > 0.05). Completion rates were significantly lower in the control group as compared to the intervention group (79.7% vs. 88.1%, p < 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates that integrating BWLSM with GLP-1 RA therapy significantly reduced gastrointestinal distress, fatigue, and lean mass loss while improving GLP-1 therapy comple- tion rates. These findings highlight the potential of structured lifestyle interventions in improving treatment tolerability and long-term suc- cess, and showcase the benefits of including lifestyle-related compan- ion-programs in GLP-1 treatment.

**Background and aims:**
The rising prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, highlights the need for effective die- tary strategies to improve health outcomes. The Mediterranean diet has been extensively studied and shown to reduce chronic disease risk. The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) offers a balanced dietary framework tailored to Australian habits, yet its comparative efficacy with the Mediterranean diet remains unexplored. Thus, this study aims to compare the efficacy of the Mediterranean diet with AGHE on body composition and glucose metabolism.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a randomised controlled trial including 57 participants (median age 31, IQR: 25-37 years; 71.9% female, BMI = 25.1 kg/m ), with 23 participants randomised to the Mediterranean diet and 34 participants to the AGHE diet for eight weeks. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight and waist cir- cumference), resting metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry) and body composition (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, DEXA) were assessed. Fasting serum samples were collected to measure glucose and insulin concentrations. Paired t-tests were employed for within- group comparisons, and analysis of covariance (ANOVA) was used for between-group comparisons, adjusted for age and baseline observations.

**Results:**
The Mediterranean diet intervention resulted in a significant decrease in waist circumference (-1.3 cm, p = 0.043), body fat percent- age (-1.8%, p = 0.014), resting metabolic rate (RMR) (-17.9 kcal/day, p = 0.02), and fasting insulin concentration (-1.2 μIU/mL, p = 0.016), along with an increase in body lean mass percentage (1.7%, p = 0.015) compared to AGHE group.

**Conclusion:**
The Mediterranean diet demonstrated greater efficacy in improving body composition and maintaining metabolic variables compared to the AGHE. These findings may support the use of the Mediterranean diet in improving health outcomes related to obesity and metabolic disorders. However, larger, well-designed clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings and explore underlying mechanisms.

**Mechanism of action of a fully human anti-thymocyte globulin, SAB-142, for the treatment of type 1 diabetes**

P.L. Colbert, A. Parizek

**Background and aims:**
SAB-142 is a fully human Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (hATG) developed as a multi-target immunomodulating therapy intended to change the treatment paradigm of T1D by delay- ing its onset and inhibiting disease progression. Recent clinical studies utilizing Rabbit Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (rATG) have demonstrated C-peptide preservation in patients with T1D and delayed disease pro- gression. Unfortunately, due to its heterologous nature, rATG has caused serum sickness in the majority of treated patients and cannot safely be re-dosed to maintain C-peptide preservation. The objective of this study was to characterize SAB-142’s pharmacologic mechanism of action (MoA) through immunoprofiling in both experiments and a first-in-human clinical study.

**Materials and methods:**
Pre-clinical studies were performed using human PBMCs isolated from fresh whole blood and incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies prior to analysis via flow cytometry. The SAB-142 Phase 1 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, single-ascending dose, adaptive design clinical study among healthy volunteers and one cohort of participants with T1D. Clinical samples were collected and PBMCs isolated and analyzed by cytometry.

**Results:**
Pre-clinical data with SAB-142 and rATG showed compara- ble cytotoxic effects, largely sparing Treg cells while reducing CD8 T cells. In addition, both ATG’s promoted activation of naïve Tconv cells and their subsequent proliferation, albeit SAB-142 did so to a greater extent. , SAB-142 induced sustained exhaustion in both CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets as evidenced by increased PD-1 and TIGIT positivity by Day 30 that continued though the end of the study, Day 120. CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations were preserved at baseline lev- els and there was a notable shift to a memory phenotype in CD4s and CD8s. Importantly, Tregs also exhibited increased inhibitory receptor expression which potentially enhanced their suppressive functions.

**Conclusion:**
These data suggest SAB-142’s MoA involves the acti- vation of CD4 and CD8 T-cells, promoting their differentiation and increased inhibitory receptor expression in the absence of cytotoxicity. Activation of Tregs may contribute to sustained suppression of CD4 and CD8 T-cells involved in antigen specific killing of beta islet cells. Similarities to rATG include Treg preservation and inhibitory receptor induction in CD4 T-cells. However, SAB-142 is distinct in its pharma- codynamic profile in the additional modulation of CD8 T cells and no observed CD4 or CD8 cytotoxicity. These findings support a muti-tar- get MoA that sustainably modulates CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations and unlike rATG does not have sustained lymphodepletion, which has not been correlated to C-peptide preservation in previous T1D clinical studies. In addition, SAB-142 does not cause serum sickness or gener- ate anti-drug antibodies allowing for re-dosing. The pharmacologic profile of SAB-142 suggests a MoA that has the potential to safely and sustainably restore immunotolerance significantly improving the treatment and prognosis of T1D.

**Engineered Tregs specific for post-translationally modified beta cell epitopes exhibit robust bystander immune suppression upon activation by stressed iPSC-islets**

**Background and aims:**
Beta cell stress contributes to autoimmune diabetes by compromising beta cell function and generating neoanti- gens. T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for neoantigens are less subject to negative selection but are ideal candidates for tolerance induction. Previous work links protein post-translational modification (PTM) with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We sought to identify novel PTM citrullinated and deamidated beta cell neoepitopes, sequence respon- sive TCRs, and advance candidates to develop engineered regulatory T cells (EngTregs) capable of suppressing autoimmunity within stressed human islets.

**Materials and methods:**
CD4 and CD8 effector T cells (Teffs) specific for modified islet epitopes were generated using lentiviral constructs to re-express sequenced TCRs. EngTregs were generated using lentiviral vectors encoding selected TCRs in conjunction with HDR-based gene editing to induce stable FOXP3 expression. Proliferation was measured with CFSE or CTV labeling of T cells; activation by CD69 CD154 flow cytometry staining. IFNγ production was measured by ELISA. Human islet-like aggregates (iPSC-islets) were generated from iPSC cells using an established 7-stage protocol.

**Results:**
T cells recognizing citrullinated or deamidated islet PTM neoepitopes from the peripheral blood of donors with type 1 diabetes were tetramer-stained, sorted, and TCR sequenced. Islet PTM spe- cific CD4 Teffs proliferated and produced IFNγ when co-cultured with irradiated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and a human beta cell line exposed to ER stress (n=5, p≤0.05 for each of 8 TCRs). When T cells were co-cultured with unstressed human beta cells, proliferation and IFNγ production was similar to control conditions without beta cells, T cells, or APCs, indicating that ER stress is required for the generation and release of PTM antigens. When added to co-cultures, EngTregs specific for modified islet PTM peptides were able to suppress the proliferation of CD4 T cells specific to the same islet PTM peptide in a direct suppression assay with peptide or CD3/CD28 beads (n=2). CD4 Teffs specific for modified islet epitopes were activated when co-cultured with ER stressed iPSC-islets and APCs, but not when co- cultured with unstressed iPSC-islets and APCs (n=3 for 7 TCRs). Simi- larly, CD8 Teffs expressing TCR specific for modified islet epitopes were activated upon co-culture with stressed iPSC-islets, resulting in islet cell death (n=3 for 4 TCRs). As expected, bystander suppres- sion (reduced proliferation of CD4 Teffs and reduced expression of CD86 and PDL1 on CD11c+ APCs) was observed upon co-culture with EngTregs recognizing an unmodified Znt8 peptide (n=3 for 7 TCRs). Bystander suppression of CD8 Teffs by EngTregs was also observed, resulting in a reduction of activation and islet cell death (n=3 for 4 TCRs).

**Conclusion:**
Citrullinated and deamidated neoepitopes form within stressed beta cells and are an attractive and actionable target for toler- ance induction through development of EngTregs that are activated by such epitopes as they are formed in stressed human beta cells. Collec- tively, EngTregs specific for beta cell-derived neoantigens may have therapeutic potential for autoimmune diabetes, enabling targeted sup- pression of autoimmunity in inflamed islets and promoting beta cell survival.

**Background and aims:**
ADO12 is an easily implantable and fully retrievable scaffold for islet transplantation aiming to cure diabetes by cell therapy without requiring immunosuppression. It is based on a permselective hydrogel film allowing insulin diffusion while prevent- ing immune cells invasion and immunoglobulins exposure. Having demonstrated in vivo immunoprotection and functionality with human islets enabling a First In Human study, the compatibility with stem cell-derived islets (SCDI) was proposed to alleviate the rarity of donor pancreas.

**Materials and methods:**
SCDI were prepared as described in 2022 from two different cell lines. They were then encapsulated in ADO12 and evaluated in vitro by glucose and exenatide insulin stimulated secretion assay (GSIS). ADO12 SCDI were implanted in 3 NXG mice for 4 months, and explants were analyzed by GSIS, total insulin con- tent, histology and immunohistochemistry.

**Results:**
Encapsulation of SCDI from 2 different cell lines maintained in vitro functionality, insulin secretion level and intracellular content compared to naked SCDI. Moreover, maturation was shown to occur in ADO12 as illustrated by the decrease of basal insulin secretion associ- ated with the increase of stimulation indexes. In vivo, encapsulated SCDI showed a steady increase in human C-peptide secretion over 2 to 3 months and reached a plateau, a kinetic comparable to published maturation phenotypes. After 132 days in vivo, explanted encapsulated SCDI showed increase of insulin secretion (3-fold), secretion indexes (1.5-fold), and total insulin content (2.4-fold) compared to pre-implan- tation levels. They maintained viability (well defined nuclei) with signs of maturation (presence of endocrine cells with glucagon- or insulin- cells but no co-expressing cells). No signs of transdifferentiation was observed (no visible canalar or acinar cells).

**Conclusion:**
The ability of SCDI to mature in ADO12 was demon- strated in vivo, a step towards treatment of type 1 diabetes with SCDI without requiring immunosuppression.

**Background and aims:**
VX-880 is an allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated islet cell therapy in clinical development for T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
This single-arm, open-label, phase 1/2/3 trial is evaluating VX-880 in T1D adults with impaired hypoglyce- mia awareness and >2 severe hypoglycemic episodes (SHEs) the year before enrollment. Participants receive a standard immunosuppres- sion regimen. Enrollment and dosing in the phase 1/2 portion has completed and phase 3 is ongoing.

**Results:**
These results reflect 12 participants who received a full VX-880 dose as a single infusion and were followed for at least one year, as of October 2024. At baseline, all participants had multiple SHEs and undetectable fasting C-peptide. All 12 participants dem- onstrated engraftment with glucose responsive C-peptide production at Day (D)90 MMTT which was durable through Month (M)12. All 12 participants achieved ADA HbA1c target of <7% (mean: base- line=7.8%; M12=6.0%) and time in range target of >70% (mean: baseline=49.5%; M12=93%); and all were free of SHEs from D90 onwards. All 12 participants had reduction in exogenous insulin use (mean reduction: 92%) and 10/12 (83%) no longer required exog- enous insulin at M12. Median duration free of exogenous insulin was 232 (69 to 441) days. All 12 participants were evaluable for and achieved the phase 1/2 primary endpoint of elimination of SHEs and HbA1c <7%. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severity. There were no VX-880-related serious AEs. Two deaths occurred; both were reported previously and unrelated to VX-880. Overall, the safety profile was consistent with the immunosuppres- sive regimen and islet infusion procedure.

**Conclusion:**
These durable clinical benefits of VX-880 with elimina- tion of SHEs, improved glycemic control, and freedom from exog- enous insulin support the curative potential of VX-880, the first and only allogeneic, stem-cell derived, islet cell therapy in pivotal development.

5. Kyoto, Japan, Orizuru Therapeutics, Inc., Fujisawa, Kanagawa,

**Background and aims:**
Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who have insulin deficiency often suffer from severe hypoglycemia due to highly fluctuating blood glucose levels. While islet transplantation can help mitigate these fluctuations, it depends on an urgent, donor-dependent procedure. Therefore, an off-the-shelf, stem cell-derived pancreatic islet cell therapy, which can be performed as an elective surgery, is highly anticipated.

**Materials and methods:**
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiP- SCs) from an allogeneic donor were differentiated into pancreatic endocrine progenitor cells, referred to as iPSC-derived pancreatic islet cells (iPICs). In preclinical studies, these iPICs matured and formed an islet-like morphology. Clinical-grade biodegradable cell sheets embed- ded with iPICs (OZTx-410), designed to support vascularization, were manufactured for cell-sheet transplantation.

**Results:**
We have initiated a Phase 1/1b study to evaluate the safety of OZTx-410 in subjects with T1D who are eligible for pancreatic islet transplantation. The first transplantation was successfully performed under general anesthesia via a midline abdominal incision. A space was created between the fascia and the parietal peritoneum, where the cell sheets were fixed with absorbable sutures. The immunosuppressive regimen followed standard islet transplantation protocols, using recom- binant anti-thymocyte globulin for induction therapy and tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil for maintenance.

**Conclusion:**
The first case of OZTx-410 transplantation has been completed. This is an open-label, single-center, dose-escalation study. Subsequent cases will further assess the safety, efficacy, and potential optimization of this cell-sheet therapy for T1D.

**Bioprinting using novel hydrogels enables functional islet trans- plants into diabetic animals without immunosuppression**

H. Stover

**Background and aims:**
Islet cell transplants can replace lost beta cells and offer a functional cure for Type 1 Diabetes; however, immune suppression for allogeneic cell survival has serious side effects, harms beta cells, and limits scale-up of this therapy. Hydrogels can encapsu- late islets, but issues with stability and immune evasion remain. We developed crosslinked, synthetic polymers that form cell-compatible hydrogels. These hydrogels are shape agnostic and can be bioprinted using available 3-axis bioprinters. Encapsulated or bioprinted rat and human donor islets remained functional and within these novel hydrogels.

**Materials and methods:**
Hydrogels were tested as capsules and 3D printed scaffolds (CELLINK Bio X printer). Physical dimensions were measured from light microscopy images (Nikon). Mechanical and chemical tests (e.g., ion chelators) were used to probe the per- sistence of the networks. Diffusion limits and rates were assessed using fluorescently labeled IgG (150 kDa) and insulin (5.8 kDa). CalceinAM and Ethidium Homodimer-I were used to assess viability of (I) human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), (II) human MSCs, as well as (III) primary rat and human islets. Glucose-stim- ulated insulin secretion (GSIS) showed rat (Lewis and Wistar) and human donor islet functionality in the hydrogels. Transplanted islet were tested (HbA1c, C-peptide, and blood glucose) in strep- tozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic immunocompetent mice, rats, Yorkshire pigs, and Göttingen minipigs. Host responses to the hydro- gels and encapsulated cells were assessed macroscopically and using immunohistochemistry.

**Results:**
Capsules and scaffolds are robust and easy to handle. Both allow exclusion of IgGs while permitting rapid insulin diffusion (~2.4-4 min ­t ). High cell viability, and GSIS indices averaging ~9x, showed that the hydrogels maintained islet function . Explanted capsules and scaffolds were retrieved intact after ~300 days and 42 days respectively. Encapsulated rat islets demonstrated rapid and persistent blood glucose control (<250 mg/dL) for 140+ days in STZ-diabetic C57BL/6 mice and 180+ days in Wistar rats. Human donor islets reduced blood glucose and increased C-peptide readings (up to 45 pmol/L) in mice and pigs. When explanted, the encapsulated islets showed good functionality and viability, no-to- minimal tissue response for capsules, and initial integration and blood vessels support for scaffolds. Host immune cells did not invade the hydrogels of either geometry.

**Conclusion:**
Our novel, retrievable hydrogels show immune pro- tection of transplanted cells in large and small immuno-competent animals. Allarta’s molecular design approach allows hydrogel cus- tomization to match the requirements of different cell types. This novel polymer platform has potential to restore lost function when combined with therapeutic cells. Fig 1. A: Viability of primary rat islets 3 days after printing. B: Explanted hMSCs show good via- bility after 1 month in healthy, immunocompetent animals without immunosuppression.

3. Aarhus, Denmark, Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Copenhagen,

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) frequently co-occurs with other chronic conditions and is considered a key driver of multi- morbidity development. However, the temporal dynamics of how T2D influences multimorbidity progression are not well understood. We aimed to investigate how T2D influenced the rate of multimorbidity progression and how these rates vary by age.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from the UK Biobank, a prospective population-based cohort study (n=502,368, median age 58 years [range 37-73], 46% male at baseline) with a median follow- up 15.3 year. 9.5% of participants were diagnosed with T2D over the period. We counted the current number of morbidities (among 80 long- term chronic conditions) identified through hospital admission records using ICD-10 diagnosis codes. We modeled the age-specific transition rates between multimorbidity states using multistate models tailored for time-split data (i.e., 2 to 3 morbidities, T2D(with1morbidity) toT2D (with 2morbidities), etc.). Age was modeled using natural splines with an interaction term with T2D, adjusting for sex, education, and body mass index.

**Results:**
The total follow-up time was 7.5 million person-years (PY), of which 0.33 million PY was in T2D. Individuals with T2D consist- ently experienced higher transition rates between morbidity transition stages. For example, the transition rate from 2 to 3 morbidities was 3.48 per 100 PY without the presence of T2D, compared to 5.68 per 100 PY once T2D was present (rate ratio=1.6). The disproportion of transition rates was most pronounced in early disease stages. Further, the transition rates were consistently influenced by T2D status and age, with younger individuals with T2D showing the most accelerated progression.

**Conclusion:**
Our study suggests that T2D is associated with acceler- ated development of subsequent multimorbidity, highlighting T2D as a critical driver of chronic disease accumulation. The disease progression is more pronounced in younger age groups, which suggests different underlying mechanisms of multimorbidity progression across age, war- ranting further investigation. The findings indicate the need for early intervention among younger people with T2D to slow multimorbidity progression.

**Background and aims:**
Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is character- ized by recurrent episodes of oxygen desaturation and reoxygenation (intermittent hypoxia [IH]) and is a risk factor for systemic inflam- mation, as well as hypertension and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). We have reported correlations between IH and T2D/hypertension. However, the question of why systemic inflammation is induced by IH has remained unanswered. Here, we investigated the effects of IH on the expression of proinflammatory/inflammatory transcripts in monocytes using an IH system.

**Materials and methods:**
Human monocytes, HL-60 and THP-1 cells, were exposed either to normoxia (5% ­CO , 21% ­O ) or 70 cycles/24 h of IH (5 min hypoxia [1% ­O ]/10 min normoxia), mimicking SAS patients, for 24 h. After the treatment, the mRNA levels of β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CXCL10, CD38, and RAGE in human HL-60 and THP-1 cells were measured by real-time RT-PCR. The protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 in HL-60 and THP-1 cell media were measured by ELISA. Reporter plasmids containing human β (-7537~+11), (-2161~+2), and (-1914~+98) were transfected into HL-60 and THP-1 cells. The cells were exposed either to IH or normoxia for 24 h, and the promoter activities were measured. MicroRNA (miR)- 146a levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR. miR-146a mimic and non-specific control RNA (miR-146a mimic NC) were introduced into HL-60 and THP-1 cells just before IH/normoxia exposure, and the mRNA and protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 were measured.

**Results:**
(1) The mRNA levels of β were significantly increased by IH in HL-60 ( =0.0211) and THP-1 cells ( =0.0052). (2) The mRNA levels of were significantly increased by IH in HL-60 ( =0.0321) and THP-1 cells ( =0.0422). (3) The mRNA levels of were significantly increased by IH in HL-60 ( =0.0209) and THP-1 cells ( =0.0006). (4) The protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 in IH- treated cell media were significantly increased ( =0.0011, =0.0419, and <0.0001 in HL-60, =0.0339, =0.0369, and <0.0001 in THP-1). (5) The promoter activities of β, IL-6, and were not increased by IH. (6) Target mRNA search of miR revealed that the mRNAs have a potential target sequence for miR-146a. (7) The miR- 146a level of IH-treated cells was significantly decreased than that of normoxia-treated cells ( =0.0378 in HL-60 and =0.0366 in THP-1). (8) The IH-induced up-regulation of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 was abol- ished by introduction of miR-146a mimic but not by miR-146a mimic NC (control).

**Conclusion:**
These results indicate that IH stress down-regulates the miR-146a in monocytes, resulting in the increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA/protein through the inhibition of the miR- 146a-mediated mechanism, leading SAS patients to systemic inflam- mation as well as T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to cardiovascular and microvascular disease risks in type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study investigated whether mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) in whole blood can serve as a biomarker for these complications.

**Materials and methods:**
mtDNA-CN was measured in the DNA extracted from whole blood samples of 497 T2D adults from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial. mtDNA-CN was expressed as number of copies of mitochondrial DNA per diploid cell. The relationship of mtDNA-CN with cardiovas- cular and microvascular complications over 5 years was assessed by Cox regression and logistic regression, respectively. Total CVD events were defined as a combination of coronary heart disease events, stroke, other cardiovascular deaths, and coronary or carotid revascularisation. Microvascular disease was defined as the presence of nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy and/or microvascular amputation.

**Results:**
The cohort (29.8 % women, mean(SD) age 62(7) years, HbA1c 7.1(1.4)%) showed no difference in mtDNA-CN by tradi- tional risk factors of age, sex, BMI, HbA1c, known diabetes dura- tion ( >0.05). The mean (SD) of mtDNA-CN was 443.9 (185.9) and correlated inversely with plasma uric acid (Rho = -0.16, = 0.002). mtDNA-CN was not associated with on-trial CVD events (HR [95% CI] = 1.05 [0.82-1.35] per SD decrease in mtDNA-CN, = 0.68), but was inversely associated with on-trial microvascular disease among participants without microvascular disease at baseline (OR [95% CI] = 1.58 [1.17-2.21] per SD decrease in mtDNA-CN, = 0.004, Table 1). Such association with on-trial microvascular disease was driven mainly by neuropathy (OR [95% CI] = 1.72 [1.17-2.62] per SD decrease in mtDNA-CN, = 0.008) and was only found in participants with non- HP 2-2 phenotype or higher HP levels or no hyperuricemia (all for interaction <0.05). In a sensitivity analysis, the association of baseline mtDNA-CN with on-trial microvascular disease remained statistically significant ( = 0.004) after the exclusion of participants with baseline mtDNA-CN in the top and bottom 5%.

**Conclusion:**
mtDNA-CN could serve as a biomarker for assessing the incident risk of microvascular disease in T2D patients, especially those with normal plasma uric acid and lower oxidative stress, but not for cardiovascular disease risk in the same population.

2. Pisa, Pisa, Italy, Department of Translational Research and New
3. Italy, Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, Italy.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) impacts neurocogni- tive functions by inducing alterations in the neurovascular unit (NVU). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can detect cortical alter- ations in relative changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemo- globin (HbR) concentrations providing proxies of NVU dysfunction. This study aims to explore NVU function in T1D and the effects of hyperglycemia and glucose excursions.

**Materials and methods:**
56 subjects with T1D and 71 normoglycemic controls (NGT) (T1D: 41±1.5 yrs; NGT: 42±1.6 yrs, p=0.6) underwent in a fasting state: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), fNIRS of visual areas during visual stimuli (reverse checkerboard at contrast 10%, 50% and 90%) to explore neuroplasticity and fNIRS of prefrontal/ motor areas during a color-based Stroop test across three conditions: naming (NC), inhibition (IC), and switching (SC) to assess corti- cal activation, executive functions and cognitive flexibility based on response time (RT), accuracy (ACC) and HbO/HbR changes. Metrics derived from real-time continuous glucose monitoring were analyzed in T1D.

**Results:**
T1D had lower BMI (24.7±0.5 vs 27±0.7 Kg/m ) and higher systolic blood pressure (SBP 123.9±2 vs 118.1±1.6 mmHg, both p<0.03). T1D and NGT had similar MoCA score (26.9±0.3 vs 26.4±0.3) and Stroop test performance. Overall, MoCA score was significantly correlated with RT-IC (r=-0.22, p=0.001) and RT-SC (r=-0.25, p=0.007). Moreover, it was associated with the slope of HbO in the mDLPFC during NC (r=0.19, p=0.03) and in the pos- terior sensory-motor region (PSM) during IC (r=-0.18, p=0.03). In T1D, HbA1c was negatively correlated with MoCA score (r=-0.36, p=0.006), which, in turn, was associated with the latency of HbO in the mDLPFC during NC (r =-0.29, p=0.02) and in the PSM during SC (r=-0.30, p=0.02) in addition to slope of HbO in the supplemen- tary motor area during SC (r=0.36; p=0.008). In T1D, mean, slope and latency to peak of HbO during visual stimuli at 90% were lower than in NGT (0.14±0.03 vs 0.27±0.03 μM, -0.27±0.07 vs 0.007±0.04 μM/s and 0.10±0.01 vs 0.14±0.01 s, respectively; all p<0.03). Latency correlated with HbA1c (r=-0.29, p=0.03), Time Above Range (TAR) over 24 hours (r=0.31, p=0.02), at night (r=0.34, p=0.02), and during the day (r=0.29, p=0.01). Conversely, it was inversely correlated with Time In Range over 24 hours and night (r=-0.29 and r=-0.33, respec- tively; p<0.03 or less). In T1D, middle dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (mDLPFC) showed a reduced mean HbO during Stroop in IC and SC as compared to NGT (-0.043±0.020 vs 0.006±0.005 μM and 0.029±0.015 vs 0.040±0.022 μM, all p<0.03). In IC, HbO slope in right DLPFC was increased in T1D (T1D: 0.04±0.02 vs 0.01±0.01 μM/S, p=0.02). In SC the latency of both HbO and HbR in left DLPFC was reduced in T1D as compared to NGT (1.31±0.09 vs 1.80±0.13 s and 1.34±0.08 vs 1.72±0.12 s, respectively; p<0.02).

**Conclusion:**
In T1D, despite preserved global cognitive performance, blunted HbO response and reduced latency to peak in visual cortices, coupled with reduced mDLPFC activation during executive function tasks, powerfully underscore an early, subclinical NVU dysfunction.

**Association between lung function and risk of peripheral vascular diseases among patients with type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study**

N. Wang

**Background and aims:**
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently exhibit impaired lung function. Emerging evidence suggests that lung dysfunction may contribute to both macro- and microvascular complications in individuals with T2DM. However, data on its associa- tion with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) remain limited. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between lung function and the risk of new- onset PVD and its subtypes in a large cohort of adults with T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
A total 14,626 (mean age 59.7 years; 61.5% male) participants with T2DM and free of baseline PVD from UK Biobank were included. Lung function measurements included forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ), forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured, and the GLI-2012 equation was used to calculate the FEV % predicted and FVC% predicted, which were further defined for obstructive physiology (OP) and restrictive physiology (RP). The primary outcome was PVD, a composite of arterial PVD, venous PVD, and other PVD subtypes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

**Results:**
During a median follow-up of 13.5 years, 1,441 (9.9%) cases of new-onset PVD were identified, comprising 690 (4.7%) arterial PVD, 570 (3.9%) venous PVD, and 440 (3.0%) other PVD. After adjusting for age, sex, race, Townsend index, education, alcohol intake frequency, smoking status, healthy diet, metabolic equivalent, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin, and cardiovascular diseases, per 1-standard deviation (SD) decrease in lung function was significantly associated with a higher risk of incident PVD: the HR (95% CI) was 1.20 (1.12-1.28) for FEV1, 1.19 (1.11-1.28) for FVC, 1.07 (1.02-1.13) for the FEV1/FVC ratio, 1.18 (1.12-1.24) for FEV1% predicted, and 1.18 (1.12-1.24) for FVC% predicted (all p <0.05). Similar associations were observed between impaired lung function and the risks of arterial PVD and other PVD subtypes. The strongest association was found for per 1-SD decrease in FEV1, which was significantly associated with incident arterial PVD (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.21-1.47). However, no significant association was observed between lung function indicators and venous PVD risk. Com- pared to patients with preserved lung function, those with OP and RP had an increased risk of arterial PVD, with adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of 1.19 (0.98-1.44) and 1.36 (1.19-1.55), respectively. Notably, T2DM patients classified as RP exhibited the highest risk of arterial PVD (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.32-1.91). Stratified analyses further demonstrated that the associations between impaired lung function (FEV and FVC) and venous PVD risk were significantly stronger in participants aged ≥60 years compared to younger individuals (p for interaction = 0.035 and 0.032, respectively).

**Conclusion:**
Impaired lung function was independently associated with an increased risk of incident PVD, particularly arterial PVD, but not venous PVD, in patients with T2DM. These findings suggest that lung function assessment may help identify high-risk individuals who could benefit from targeted preventive interventions.

**Background and aims:**
While sarcopenia has been associated with increased mortality in older adults, its impact in younger populations remains unclear. Most previous research has focused on older individu- als, potentially underestimating the clinical relevance of sarcopenia in younger adults. This study aimed to evaluate the association between sarcopenia and mortality in relatively young adults.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2006 and linked mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). A total of 16,478 U.S. adults aged ≥20 years with available dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and mortality data were included. Sar- copenia was defined using appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) adjusted for body mass index (ASM/BMI), and participants were strati- fied into three age groups: 20-39, 40-59, and ≥60 years. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

**Results:**
Sarcopenia was associated with an increased risk of mortality across age groups. Among individuals aged ≥60 years, this association remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, sex, race/ ethnicity, comorbidities, and social factors (Figure C; HR = 1.27 [95% CI 1.06-1.53]; P < 0.05). In adults aged 40-59 years, sarcopenia was more significantly associated with increased mortality (Figure B; HR = 2.28 [95% CI 1.68-3.12]; P < 0.01). In contrast, no significant asso- ciation was observed in the 20-39 years group, likely due to a limited number of events. Cause-specific mortality analysis in middle-aged adults showed increased risks for malignancy-related mortality (HR = 2.35 [1.20-4.64]; P < 0.05) and other-cause mortality (HR = 2.25 [1.41-3.60]; P < 0.01), but not for cardiovascular mortality. In adults aged ≥60 years, only other-cause mortality showed a significant asso- ciation with sarcopenia (HR = 1.26 [95% CI 1.02-1.58]; P < 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Sarcopenia was significantly associated with increased mortality in middle-aged adults, particularly from cancer and other causes. These findings highlight that sarcopenia may contribute to elevated mortality risk even in relatively young populations.

**Background and aims:**
Cellular senescence, a stress-induced stable cell-cycle arrest, is a growing focus in metabolic dysfunction-associ- ated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) research. While the gut micro- biome is implicated in MASLD development, the role of microbial metabolites in liver senescence and progression to steatohepatitis remains unclear. This study examines liver senescence and the causal impact of gut microbial metabolites on senescence-driven liver disease

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed liver RNA transcriptomics and fasting and post-prandial plasma metabolomics from 300 individuals with severe obesity (median age 48, 76.4% women; median BMI 38 kg/ m², 23.9% diabetes, and 60.5% MASLD). Senescent cells were identi- fied through liver transcriptomics (using two senescence signature sets: Sennet and Senmayo and the canonical marker p21), immunohisto- chemistry, and Western blotting.The cohort was stratified into tertiles based on senescence marker expression to calculate odds ratios for MASH and diabetes. Correlations between senescence markers and plasma metabolites were assessed, and candidate metabolites were validated in a Finnish cohort of 10,187 men using Cox regression for liver-related mortality. To explore causality, wild-type mice on a chow diet were administered the candidate metabolite daily, with or without senolytics (dasatinib and quercetin). After 14 days, liver enzymes, liver triglycerides, and senescence markers were measured.

**Results:**
Liver senescence, independent of age, was strongly associated with MASH, with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.75 (95% CI: 2.44-9.51, p < 0.001) in individuals in the highest tertile of senescence. Similarly, the OR for diabetes was 3.95 (95% CI: 1.85-8.92, p < 0.001) for individu- als in this tertile. A significant association was observed between senes- cence markers and the microbial metabolite 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate in both fasting (R = 0.27, p-FDR < 0.001) and post-prandial conditions (R = 0.39, p-FDR < 0.001). In the validation cohort, Cox regression showed that elevated HPLA levels were associated with increased liver- related mortality (HR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.74-2.62, p < 0.005). In mice, intraperitoneal HPLA administration led to dose-dependent increases in serum ALT, hepatic triglycerides, and senescence marker expression. Senolytic treatment alleviated liver steatosis and reduced serum ALT levels in HPLA-treated mice

**Conclusion:**
Liver senescence is linked to more severe disease in indi- viduals with obesity. The microbial metabolite HPLA correlates with senescence markers and is associated with liver disease severity and increased liver-related mortality risk. In mice, HPLA induces hepatic injury and steatosis, effects that are mitigated by senolytic treatment. These findings suggest that HPLA drives liver injury through hepatic cellular senescence

3. Denmark, 3University of Kentucky, Saha Cardiovascular Research

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease with no widely effective treatment options that achieve sustained weight loss while providing comprehensive metabolic benefits. RES-010 is a first-in-class antisense oligonucleotide that uniquely acts upstream at the gene regulatory level, targeting miR-22, a master regulator of lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and adipose tissue remodeling. By simultaneously modulating multiple interconnected pathways, RES-010 aims to reprogram metabolic homeostasis, offering a novel therapeutic strategy orthogonal from existing interventions. Here, we report on a subset of the preclinical development of RES-010 and the design of its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial.

**Materials and methods:**
RES-010 was evaluated in murine models of obesity to assess its effects on body weight and metabolic health. Its efficacy was also tested in non-human primates (NHP) subjected to a fast-food diet, and in 3D model of human primary adipose tissue to evaluate its impact in translationally relevant settings. Additionally, the combination of RES-010 with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP- 1RA) was investigated in murine models to assess potential additive or synergistic effects. Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and safety were analyzed in rodent and NHP models. The first in human study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial assessing safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in healthy lean and overweight to obese participants.

**Results:**
In obese mice, RES-010 treatment led to a significant and sustained weight loss, with effects persisting even after treatment discontinuation, suggesting a durable metabolic rewire. Notably, in combination with a GLP-1RA, RES-010 further potentiated weight loss, enabling a less intensive Semaglutide treatment regimen while maintaining efficacy. The efficacy of RES-010 has also been evaluated in non-human primates on a fast-food diet, showing reduction of body weight in animals with unhealthy adiposity, further supporting its trans- lational potential. Preclinical studies demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with no significant adverse effects observed in rodent and non-human primate models. The Phase 1 clinical trial combining Single and Multiple Ascending Dose in healthy lean and overweight/ obese subjects is ongoing, with the first patient enrolled in November 2024: Pharmacokinetic, safety and exploratory pharma- codynamic data expected beginning of 2026.

**Conclusion:**
RES-010 demonstrates the ability to induce long-last- ing weight loss in preclinical models, with effects sustained beyond treatment cessation. Its efficacy in NHPs under a fast-food diet and its ability to enhance the effects of GLP-1RA while allowing a less inten- sive dosing schedule support its potential as a transformative obesity therapy. The ongoing Phase 1 trial will also provide key translational insights, guiding further clinical development.

**Background and aims:**
Oral glucose flux to the liver plays a crucial role in the development and progression of metabolic dysfunction- associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), promoting de novo lipogenesis, inflammation, and oxidative damage. Individuals with MASLD display an augmented expression of duodenal glucose trans- porters, which may amplify liver exposure to hyperglycaemia by enhancing intestinal glucose absorption. However, the impact of oral glucose absorption in MASLD pathogenesis remains unexplored. This study employed stable glucose isotopes to quantify post-load glucose metabolic fluxes in individuals with MASLD.

**Materials and methods:**
In this clinical study, 32 non-diabetic vol- unteers with or without MASLD (age 47.8±14.4 years, 16 [50%] women, BMI 27.5±4.8 kg/m ) underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with two stable glucose isotopes (oral [U- C] glucose and intravenous [6,6- H ] glucose) to measure glucose metabolic fluxes, including rate of appearance of oral glucose (RaO), endog- enous glucose production (EGP), and glucose clearance (GCl). Insu- lin secretion rate (ISR) was estimated by C-peptide deconvolution.

**Results:**
Individuals with MASLD (n=16) had higher BMI (+4.1±1.6 kg/m , =0.019), fasting plasma insulin (+24±9 pmol/l, =0.015), HOMA-IR (+1.2±0.4, =0.008), LDL choles- terol (+22±10.6 mg/dl, =0.046), and triglycerides (+46±10 mg/ dl, =0.0002), but similar age, sex distribution, fasting glucose, ­HbA , FIB-4 score, and liver enzymes, compared to those without MASLD. During OGTT, plasma glucose at 2 hours, plasma insulin, ISR, and Matsuda index were similar between groups. The MASLD group showed higher RaO (group by time interaction: =0.013; Figure A), particularly in the first hour after the oral glucose load (AUC​ +555±247 μmol/kg , =0.032; Figure B), along with higher 1-hour plasma glucose levels (+23±11 mg/dl, =0.041). Group differences in RaO AUC​ remained statistically signifi- cant after adjustments for BMI ( =0.001) and for age, sex, BMI, HOMA-IR, and FIB-4 ( =0.011). EGP and GCl were not affected by MASLD, even after accounting for portal (EGP×ISR) or peripheral (GCl/Ins) insulin levels.

**Conclusion:**
Intestinal glucose absorption is augmented in individu- als with liver steatosis. This metabolic alteration, leading to post- prandial glucose overload to the liver, may be a critical driver of MASLD pathogenesis. Therapeutic strategies modulating intestinal glucose transport may complement existing treatments targeting MASLD.

**GPRC5B-Gα12 signalling activates SREBP1c transcription to pro- mote hepatic lipid accmulation in MASLD**

2. China, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic-Associated Steatotic Liver Dis- ease (MASLD) is a metabolic disorder characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver. Sterol regulatory element-binding pro- tein 1c (SREBP1c) is considered a potential therapeutic target for MASLD,which plays a central role in de novo lipogenesis (DNL). G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of membrane receptor proteins in the human body. G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member B (GPRC5B), a member of the GPRC5 family, has been implicated in metabolic regulation. Genome- wide association studies have identified a strong correlation between a 21 kb copy number variation upstream of the human GPRC5B gene and body mass index. Notably, knockout of the Gprc5b gene in mice con- fers resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Gα12, encoded by the GNA12 gene, belongs to the Gα protein family. Gα, together with Gβγ, forms a heterotrimeric G-protein that receives signals from GPCRs and plays a crucial role in the signal transduction process. This study we aims to elucidate the impact of GPRC5B on hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation. To investigate whether GPRC5B interacts with Gα12 to modulate SREBP1c expression, thereby influ- encing the lipid metabolism and promoting progression of MASLD.

**Materials and methods:**
GPRC5B expression was assessed in MASLD patients, animal models (db/db, ob/ob mice), and cellular models treated with free fatty acids (FFAs). Huh7 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes were infected with GPRC5B overexpression or knockdown adenoviruses, followed by FFAs treatment, to analyze its role in hepatic triglyceride (TG) metabolism. Hepatocyte-spe- cific GPRC5B overexpression was achieved via tail vein injection of adeno-associated viruses, while hepatocyte-specific Gprc5b and Srebp1c knockout mice were generated using the Cre-loxP system and fed a high-fat diet to induce MASLD. Transcriptomic and proteomic sequencing were performed to identify GPRC5B-related genes and signaling pathways. Co-immunoprecipition, GST pull-down, protein immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry sequencing technology(IP- MS), laser confocal microscopy, RNA interference, and small molecule inhibitor were conducted to investigate whether GPRC5B regulates SREBP1c through Gα12.

**Results:**
The expression of GPRC5B was significantly elevated (p<0.05) in various MASLD models and patients. In vitro and in vivo overexpression of GPRC5B resulted in increased TG accumulation in hepatocytes, accompanied by a significant upregulation of the fatty acid synthesis gene SREBP1c and its downstream targets, ACC and FAS. Conversely, knockdown of GPRC5B led to a reduction in TG con- tent within hepatocytes. Notably, we identified an interaction between the Gα12 protein and GPRC5B, and subsequently constructed a seg- mentation vector for both proteins. Using a GST pulldown assay, we confirmed the binding of the GPRC5B protein segment 330-436 with the Gα12 protein. Further experiments employing siRNA targeting GNA12, RHOA, ROCK1, and their respective inhibitors demonstrated that GPRC5B modulates SREBP1c transcription via the Gα12/RHOA/ ROCK1 signaling pathway.

**Conclusion:**
This study reveals that GPRC5B promotes SREBP1c transcription by interacting with Gα12 in regulating hepatocytes lipid accumulation and exacerbating MASLD progression.

**Hepatic STK4 plays a role in systemic lipid homeostasis and hepatic ferroptosis**

D. Li

**Background and aims:**
Serine/threonine kinase 4 (STK4) is a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway that regulates cell pro- liferation, apoptosis, and metabolic homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that STK4 plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and insulin resistance by regulating PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis, IRS1 phos- phorylation, and β-cell function. However, its hepatic-specific role in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) pathogenesis remains undefined. This study aims to elucidate the mechanistic involvement of hepatic STK4 in lipid dysregulation dur- ing MASLD progression.

**Materials and methods:**
We utilised genetically engineered mice (STK4fl/fl and Alb-Cre) to investigate the effect of STK4 on hepatic lipid metabolism. All mice were subjected to either a normal-chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks, with longitudinal moni- toring of metabolic parameters including body composition, serum lipid profiles, and hepatic inflammation. Complementary gain-of-func- tion studies were conducted using AAV8-mediated liver-specific STK4 overexpression. Multi-dimensional analyses encompassing proteomics, lipidomics, and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) were conducted to unravel molecular mechanisms.

**Results:**
Hepatic STK4 ablation in HFD-fed mice manifested signifi- cantly attenuated body weight gain, improved systemic lipid profiles, and reduced hepatic steatosis with concomitant suppression of inflam- matory markers. Furthermore, we found that liver-specific STK4 knockout significantly inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of genes related to de novo lipogenesis (such as SREBP1, FAS, and SCD1), while no significant changes were observed in the expression of genes related to fatty acid uptake, oxidation, and transport. Con- versely, liver-specific overexpression of STK4 resulted in an opposite phenotype, with a significant increase in body weight, pronounced hepatic inflammatory cell infiltration, and exacerbated liver fibrosis. Mechanistically, multi-omics analysis revealed that STK4 promoted the development of MASLD through ACSL4-mediated ferroptosis.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings establish hepatic STK4 as a pivotal regulator of MASLD pathogenesis, coordinating lipid biosynthesis and hepatic ferroptosis via the ACSL4 axis.

**Background and aims:**
Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is elevated in metabolic diseases, including obesity and metabolic dys- function-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). GDF15 secretion is linked to hepatic mitochondrial stress in preclinical models and to (markers of) insulin resistance in humans. In humans, MASLD is also associated with altered hepatic mitochondrial capacity. We therefore hypothesised that GDF15 levels correlate with hepatic mitochondrial respiration in participants with obesity across different MASLD stages.

**Materials and methods:**
Sixty humans with obesity-related insulin resistance (M-value: 2.72±0.16 mg/kg/min, mean±SEM) and with or without biopsy-confirmed MASLD were included. Whole-body (M-value) and adipose-tissue (insulin-induced suppression of non- esterified fatty acids (NEFA)) insulin sensitivity were assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Mitochondrial respiration was measured in liver tissue by high-resolution respirometry, while fasting serum total GDF15 levels were quantified by ELISA. Associations were assessed by Spearman correlation.

**Results:**
GDF15 correlated negatively with M-value (r=-0.355, p=0.017) and NEFA suppression (r=-0.293, p=0.046). While GDF15 did not associate with hepatic mitochondrial respiration across the whole cohort, stratification according to fibrosis revealed opposite cor- relations in people with (n=37, age: 41±2 years, BMI: 49±1 kg/m ) or without any degree of fibrosis (n=23, age: 44±2 years, BMI: 49±1 kg/m ). In the absence of fibrosis, GDF15 correlated positively with fatty acid oxidation-linked mitochondrial respiration ­(F ; r=0.3473, p=0.035), as well as when combined with NADH pathway-linked ­(FN ; r=0.3495, p=0.034) and NADH+succinate pathway-linked ­(FNS ; r=0.4206, p=0.010) mitochondrial respiration. Conversely, in the presence of fibrosis, GDF15 correlated negatively with ­FN (r=- 0.4753, p=0.022).

**Conclusion:**
In humans with obesity and MASLD, circulating GDF15 levels are positively related to whole-body and adipose tissue insu- lin resistance. Presence of fibrosis seems to inverse the correlation of GDF15 with features of hepatic mitochondrial respiration.

**Background and aims:**
This post hoc analysis assessed the efficacy and hypoglycaemia outcomes with once-weekly insulin icodec (ico- dec) vs once-daily (OD) basal insulin comparators in insulin-naive (ONWARDS 1, 3, 5) and insulin-experienced (ONWARDS 2, 4) adults with type 2 diabetes by baseline ­HbA .

**Materials and methods:**
Treatment outcomes were analysed, by trial, across baseline ­HbA subgroups (≤8%, >8-≤9%, >9%).

**Results:**
Overall, a numerically greater reduction in ­HbA was seen with icodec vs OD comparators across ­HbA subgroups in all trials, except for the >8-≤9% and >9% subgroups in ONWARDS 4 (basal- bolus trial) ( ). There was no statistically significant treatment by ­HbA subgroup interaction in any trial for change in ­HbA from baseline to planned end of treatment (EOT). Rates of clinically sig- nificant or severe hypoglycaemia were low (<1 event/patient-year of exposure) across arms irrespective of baseline ­HbA except in ONWARDS 4 where rates were numerically higher in both arms across subgroups. There was no statistically significant treatment by ­HbA subgroup interaction in any trial for the achievement of ­HbA <7% at EOT without clinically significant or severe hypogly- caemia in the prior 12 weeks.

**Conclusion:**
Efficacy and hypoglycaemia outcomes for icodec vs OD comparators were overall similar across baseline ­HbA subgroups.

**Background and aims:**
Basal insulin plays a key role in T2D treat- ment, but there is a substantial burden with daily injections. Efsitora alfa (Efsitora) is an innovative once-weekly basal insulin in develop- ment for diabetes. This Ph3 study assessed the efficacy and safety of efsitora vs degludec in adults with T2D treated with basal insulin.

**Materials and methods:**
The 78-wk, parallel-design, open-label study randomised 986 adults with T2D, ­HbA ≥6.5 and ≤10% (≥47.5 and ≤85.8 mmol/mol), 2:1 to efsitora:degludec. Doses were titrated to fasting blood glucose 80-120 mg/dL (4.4-6.7 mmol/L) based on previous basal dose, fasting blood glucose, and hypogly- caemia. The primary endpoint was ­HbA change from baseline to week 26 (non-inferiority margin 0.4%).

**Results:**
Efsitora achieved a noninferior ­HbA reduction at week 26 of -0.81% vs -0.72% (-8.85 vs -7.87 mmol/mol) for degludec (estimated treatment difference −0.09%; 95% CI −0.19 to 0.01, p=0.08) to 6.99% and 7.08% (52.89 and 53.87 mmol/mol), respec- tively. At week 26, percent time in range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dL (3.9- 10.0 mmol/L)) was 62.8% for efsitora and 61.3% for degludec, an increase of 2 hours compared to baseline (p=0.235). Rates of com- bined clinically significant (level 2 [<54 mg/dL; <3.0 mmol/L]) or severe (level 3) hypoglycaemia were low and similar for efsitora and degludec (0.84 vs 0.74 events per patient-year of exposure, p=0.430). Serious adverse event incidence was higher in participants treated with efsitora (15.7%) vs degludec (11.2%) with angina unstable as the most frequent event for efsitora (0.8%) and events of coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction and pneumonia the most frequent (1.2% each) for degludec.

**Conclusion:**
In adults with T2D treated with basal insulin, efsitora demonstrated noninferiority to degludec in ­HbA reduction at 26 weeks, which was maintained to 78 weeks of treatment. Both efistora and degludec-treated participants achieved increased TIR by 2 hours with similarly low rates of hypoglycaemia.

**Background and aims:**
QWINT-1 evaluated innovative fixed-dose titration of weekly insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) vs daily glargine U100 over 52 wks in 795 insulin naïve adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Efsitora demonstrated noninferior HbA1c reduction to 53 mmol/mol (7%) compared to glargine, with lower rates of clinically meaningful hypoglycemia. This exploratory report examines baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes by administered insulin dose.

**Materials and methods:**
Efsitora was initiated at 100 U/wk using a single-dose pen, with titration every 4 wks to fixed doses of 150, 250, and 400 U to achieve a fasting blood glucose (FBG) target of 4.4-7.2 mmol/L (80-130 mg/dL). Participants not achieving tar- get FBG on 400 U transitioned to an efsitora multi-dose pen with flexible dosing. Glargine was administered using a multi-dose pen and titrated weekly to achieve the same FBG target. This analysis assessed clinical characteristics and proportion of participants on each dose, HbA1c reduction by efsitora dose at wk 52, and hypogly- cemia incidence during the active efsitora fixed-dose titration period (wk 0-16) and after any fixed-dose increases throughout the study.

**Results:**
Participants on higher efsitora doses at wk 52 had greater baseline weight, BMI, HbA1c and fasting glucose, with a higher proportion of males. Most participants (76%) remained on a fixed efsitora dose, but some on 400 U transitioned to flexible dosing (Figure). HbA1c reductions were similar across all efsitora doses: participants on ≤400 U/wk had mean HbA1c changes of -1.3% (-14.6 mmol/mol) and -1.3% (-14.0 mmol/mol) with efsitora and glargine, respectively while those on >400 U/wk had changes of -1.2% (-13.2 mmol/mol) and -1.3% (-14.1 mmol/mol). Hypoglycemia rates remained low throughout the study. In wks 0-16, during which most of the fixed efsitora dose increases occurred (Figure), the rate of level 2 or 3 hypoglycemia was lower with efsitora vs glargine (0.34 vs 0.69 events/year; relative rate 0.50 [95% CI 0.27, 0.92], p=0.027). Based on events occurring within 4 wk periods after an efsitora fixed-dose increase, the estimated rate of level 2 or 3 hypoglycemia was below 0.5 events/year.

**Conclusion:**
In QWINT-1, trends in certain characteristics were as expected: those requiring higher doses had greater baseline BMI and glycemic measures. HbA1c reductions were similar across efsitora doses compared to glargine at wk 52. Fixed-dose titration, including escalation to higher doses, did not increase the clinically significant hypoglycemia rate.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) is a basal insulin with a flat pharmacokinetic profile and long half-life that allows for once-weekly (QW) administration. The QWINT-1 study investigated use of a first-of-its-kind fixed-dose titration for efsitora.

**Materials and methods:**
In this 52-week, phase 3, parallel-design, open-label, treat-to-target trial, 975 insulin-naïve adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were randomized 1:1 to efsitora or glargine U100. Efsitora was started at a QW dose of 100 U, administered using a single-dose pen. The efsitora dose could be escalated every 4 weeks to fixed-doses of 150, 250, and 400 U, as needed, to achieve a fast- ing blood glucose (FBG) target of 4.4-7.2 mmol/L (80-130 mg/dL) (Figure). If after at least 4 weeks at 400 U, median FBG was >7.2 mmol/L (>130 mg/dL), participants switched to variable doses of efsitora >400 U using a multi-dose pen. Once-daily (QD) glargine was administered using a multi-dose pen and titrated weekly to achieve similar targets. Primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline to week 52 (noninferiority margin, 0.4%).

**Results:**
Overall, 397 participants (49.9%) were female, mean age 56.3 years, duration of diabetes 9.4 years, and BMI 31.9 kg/m . Mean HbA1c decreased from 8.20% (66.1 mmol/mol) to 7.05% (53.5 mmol/mol) at week 52 with efsitora and from 8.28% (67.0 mmol/ mol) to 7.08% (53.9 mmol/mol) with glargine. An estimated treat- ment difference (ETD) for HbA1c change from baseline of −0.03% (−0.34 mmol/mol) (95% CI −0.18 to 0.12% [-2.0 to 1.3 mmol/mol]) confirmed noninferiority of efsitora to glargine. At week 52, 76% of efsitora-treated participants remained on one of the fixed doses. Insulin dose was statistically significantly lower with efsitora (289 U/week [~41 U/day]) vs glargine (333 U/week [~48 U/day]; ETD −43.7 [95% CI −62.4 to −25.0], p<0.001). Fewer dose titrations were needed with efsitora vs glargine (mean 3.5 vs 9.4). The rate of combined clinically significant (<3 mmol/L [<54 mg/dL], Level 2) or severe (Level 3) hypoglycemia from week 0 to 52, was 43% lower with efsitora vs glargine (0.50 vs 0.88 events/year [relative rate 0.57; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.84; p=0.005). Incidences of adverse events were similar between groups.

**Conclusion:**
In insulin-naïve adults with T2D, fixed-dose titration of QW efsitora had similar mean HbA1c reductions to 7%, with lower rates of clinically meaningful hypoglycemia, compared to QD glar- gine. This simple fixed-dose regimen for QW efsitora could facilitate insulin treatment and reduce injection burden compared to traditional titration of QD insulins.

**Background and aims:**
Once-weekly (QW) insulins have emerged as a research focus due to their potential to enhance treatment accept- ance and adherence by reducing injection frequency. This trial stud- ied the efficacy and safety of a novel QW insulin analogue GZR4 ver- sus once-daily (QD) insulin degludec (IDeg) in basal insulin-treated participants with T2D inadequately controlled by OADs.

**Materials and methods:**
In this open-label, treat-to-target phase 2 trial, 96 eligible participants with HbA1c from 7.5 to 10.0% were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either GZR4 or IDeg treatment for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was HbA1c change from base- line to week 16. Safety endpoints, including hypoglycaemia and TEAE, were evaluated.

**Results:**
The LSM HbA1c reduction was significantly higher in the GZR4 than in the IDeg group (−1.26% vs. −0.87%, < 0.01). The proportion of participants achieving HbA1c <7% was higher in GZR4 group. GZR4 group showed a strikingly lower weekly insu- lin dosage at the steady state than IDeg group (88.7 vs. 218.2 U/ week, <0.001). Incidences of TEAEs were similar between the two treatments. GZR4 group showed a slightly higher level 2 hypogly- caemia incidence than IDeg group.

**Conclusion:**
GZR4 demonstrated superior HbA1c reduction after 16 weeks of treatment in insulin-treated participants with T2D and is promising to be a safe and effective QW basal insulin in diabetes management.

**Background and aims:**
Once-weekly (QW) insulin aims to reduce treatment burden by lowering injection frequency, potentially enhancing treatment acceptance and adherence. This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of a novel QW insulin analogue GZR4 versus once-daily (QD) insulin degludec (IDeg) in insulin-naïve participants with T2D inad- equately controlled by OADs.

**Materials and methods:**
In this open-label, treat-to-target phase 2 trial, 83 eligible participants with HbA1c between 7.5% and 10.0% were ran- domised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either GZR4 or IDeg treatment for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 16. Safety endpoints, including hypoglycaemia and TEAE, were evaluated.

**Results:**
The LSM HbA1c reduction was comparable between GZR4 and IDeg groups (−1.50% vs. -1.48%, = 0.902). GZR4 group showed a simi- lar proportion of achieving HbA1c goals and FPG reduction compared to IDeg, but with a half lower weekly insulin dosage at steady state than IDeg (80.6 vs 165.8 U/week, <0.001). TEAEs were mild and similar between groups, with low and comparable rates of level 2 hypoglycaemia. No SAEs were deemed related to GZR4.

**Conclusion:**
GZR4 demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety profiles to QD IDeg in participants with T2D, achieving similar outcomes with a lower insulin dose. GZR4 is promising to be a safe and effective QW insulin in diabetes management.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the lead- ing cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal dis- ease worldwide. Glucagon has important effects on kidney function, either directly through intrarenal glucagon receptor (GCGR) signal- ing or indirectly through other humoral actions. There is an emerging appreciation that renal GCGR function is impaired in CKD and may contribute to the development and progression of the disease. Sur- vodutide is a novel long-acting dual GCGR/GLP-1 receptor agonist in clinical phase 3 trial for the treatment of people living with obesity or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The present study aimed to characterize the effects of survodutide in a state-of- the-art translational mouse model of advanced DKD, facilitated by adeno-associated virus-mediated renin overexpression (ReninAAV) in uninephrectomized (UNx) female diabetic db/db mice.

**Materials and methods:**
Female obese and diabetic db/db C57BKS mice (12-13 weeks of age) received a single intravenous dose of Reni- nAAV by study Week -4 and underwent UNx at study Week -3. db/db ReninAAV-UNx mice were randomized to treatment based on baseline body weight, fed blood glucose and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) measured at study Week -1. Mice were administered vehicle (s.c.) or survodutide (7.5 mg, s.c.) once daily for 10 weeks. Endpoints included blood/urine biochemistry, 2D histological markers of glomer- ulosclerosis (PAS), tubular injury (KIM-1) and inflammation (F4/80), as well as quantitative 3D whole-pancreas (insulin+ β-cell islet vol- ume) and whole-kidney (kidney volume, podocin+ glomeruli) imaging.

**Results:**
Compared to vehicle controls, survodutide robustly reduced body weight (43.4±1.1 vs 55.4±1.4 g, p<0.001), hyperglycaemia (7.8±0.6 vs 12.8±1.3 mmol/L, p=0.002), HbA1c levels (4.9±0.3 vs 6.1±0.3%, p<0.001), and hyperinsulinemia (2555±292 vs 6512±941 pg/mL, p<0.001) concurrent with improved β-cell islet volume distribution (higher % of islets in 0.1-0.2 ­mm volume cat- egory, p<0.01) in db/db ReninAAV-UNx mice. Notably, survodutide promoted substantial benefits on markers of advanced albuminuria (1943±406 vs 3415±507 μg/mL, p=0.03), severe glomerulosclero- sis (glomerulosclerosis index, 0.29±0.05 vs 0.78±0.09, p<0.001), kidney hypertrophy and inflammation in db/db ReninAAV-UNx mice. In support of improved kidney health, 3D whole-kidney imag- ing revealed that survodutide significantly reduced kidney volume (181±6.1 vs 214±4.5 ­mm , p<0.001), total/mean glomeruli volume while increasing glomeruli density (78±2.7 vs 67±1.8 glomeruli/ mm , p=0.003) and completely reversed tubular-glomeruli detach- ment in db/db ReninAAV-UNx mice. Survodutide robustly reduced plasma amino acid levels, including alanine (147±58 vs 245±52 μmol/L, p=0.002), confirming hepatic glucagon receptor activation.

**Conclusion:**
Survodutide markedly improved metabolic and renal outcomes in the db/db UNx-ReninAAV mouse model of advanced DKD, supporting further investigations into therapeutic options of survodutide in chronic kidney diseases.

**Background and aims:**
Amycretin is a novel unimolecular agonist on the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and amylin recep- tors (AMYRs) in clinical development for type-2-diabetes and weight management. We characterized amycretin in vitro, assessed the phar- macokinetic (PK) profile, investigated brain access and effects on food , body weight, insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

**Materials and methods:**
In vitro potency was determined on mouse, rat and human GLP-1R, calcitonin receptor (CTR) and amylin recep- tors (AMYRs) using reporter gene and time-resolved fluorescence assays. PK was assessed after single dose intravenous injections[KR1]. Diet-induced obese (DIO) male mice (C57Bl/6J) and DIO male rats (Sprague Dawley, SD) were dosed daily (10 nmol/kg, s.c) for 3 wks to assess effects on food intake and body weight. Rats were single housed in an indirect calorimetry system to measure energy expendi- ture. A weight matched, calorie-restricted group was included. Brain distribution was mapped in fixed brains from normal weight male mice (C57BL/6J) after a single injection with fluorescently labelled amycretin. Insulin sensitivity was investigated in male DIO rats (SD) by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycemic clamp after 5 wks of daily amycre- tin dosing (10 nmol/kg, s.c.). Effect on MASLD was investigated in DIO-MASLD male mice after 12 wks of twice-daily dosing (10 or 30 nmol/kg, s.c.), calculating the total MASLD activity score by sum- ming the scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning.

**Results:**
Amycretin was a potent agonist of human, mouse and rat GLP-1R, AMYRs and CTR. Half-life’s were (h): rats (SD): 5.92, Göt- tingen minipigs: 54.1, and Vietnamese cynomolgus monkeys; 29.3. Vehicle-adjusted weight loss was 21% in DIO mice and 18% in DIO rats. The weight loss in rats was driven by reduction in food intake (47%) and by maintenance of energy expenditure which was 14% higher than in weight matched rats (p<0.01). Amycretin reached brain regions important for regulation of food intake and metabolism, includ- ing the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the area postrema. Insulin sensitivity was improved significantly as shown by reduced levels of fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin, a 3-fold higher glucose infusion rate (p<0.005 compared to vehicle) during clamp and a significantly higher glucose uptake by hindlimb muscles. Amycretin dose-dependently improved MASLD score with a 64.7% improvement compared to vehicle at the highest dose (30 nmol/ kg). The improvement was primarily driven by reduction of steatosis.

**Conclusion:**
Amycretin accessed key brain regions that regulate food intake, energy expenditure and insulin-sensitivity and had beneficial effects on metabolic health in mice and rats; effectively reducing food intake and body weight, while maintaining energy expenditure, enhancing insulin sensitivity and improving MASLD activity scores. The data emphasize amycretin is a promising therapeutic option for metabolic diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes, warranting further clinical trials assessing its efficacy in humans.

1. Zealand Pharma A/S, Soeborg, Denmark, Profil, Neuss, Germany.

**Background and aims:**
Dapiglutide is a first-in-class GLP-1R/ GLP-2R agonist in development for weight management designed to address low-grade inflammation and obesity-associated co-morbidities. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of (once- weekly) s.c. dapiglutide were investigated in a phase 1b trial.

**Materials and methods:**
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 54 healthy participants with BMI 27-39.9 kg/m2 (85% male, median age: 46 yrs, BMI: 30.0 kg/m2, body weight: 95.1 kg) were randomized (14:4) within 3 dose cohorts. Dose escalation every 2nd week was used to reach target doses of 7.5 mg, 10 mg and 13 mg during a 13-week treatment period. No lifestyle interventions were included in the trial.

**Results:**
Dapiglutide appeared safe with no related serious or severe adverse events (AEs). The most frequent AEs reported were gastroin- testinal (GI) disorders and metabolism and nutrition disorders (mainly decreased appetite). Most AEs were mild. Two dapiglutide treated participants discontinued due to AEs (GI AEs). The pharmacokinetics showed dose proportionality and a mean half-life of 112-119 hours across the 3 dose cohorts. Low titers of ADA were detected at follow- up in 14.3% of the participants dosed with dapiglutide with no apparent impact on PK, efficacy or safety. After 13 weeks (of which 9, 7 and 5 weeks were on target doses), the placebo-corrected estimated mean decrease in body weight (efficacy estimand) was 6.7%, 8.3% and 7.1% for the dose cohorts of 7.5 mg, 10 mg and 13 mg, respectively. The mean body weight gain on placebo was 2.1%.

**Conclusion:**
Dapiglutide treatment of up to 13 mg appeared safe and well-tolerated with an adverse events profile similar to other incretin- based therapies. The placebo-adjusted reductions in body weight were up to a mean of 8.3% with dapiglutide after 13 weekly doses. The half- life of dapiglutide is suitable for once-weekly dosing. Doses up to 26 mg are currently being evaluated.

**REDEFINE1: a randomised study of combined semaglutide 2.4 mg and cagrilintide 2.4 mg for the treatment of overweight or obesity in adults**

W.T. Garvey, M. Blüher, C. Karenina Osorto ­Contreras, M.J., ­Davies, E. Winning ­Lehmann, K.H. Pietiläinen, D. ­Rubino, P., ­Sbraccia, L. von Huth ­Smith, T. ­Wadden, N. ­Zeuthen, J. ­Wilding

**Background and aims:**
Both semaglutide 2.4 mg and cagrilintide 2.4 mg monotherapies have led to weight loss in previous studies. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of the combination of semaglutide 2.4 mg and cagrilintide 2.4 mg (CagriSema) as treat- ment for overweight/obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
REDEFINE 1, a phase 3a, 68-week, dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, enrolled adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m , or ≥27 kg/m with ≥1 weight-related comorbidity, without T2D. Participants (pts) were randomised 21:3:3:7 to receive once-weekly s.c. CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg, sema 2.4 mg, cagri 2.4 mg or placebo (pbo), in addition to lifestyle intervention. Co-primary endpoints were % change in body weight (BW) and proportion of pts achieving a BW reduction of ≥5% from baseline to week 68 for CagriSema vs pbo. Additional endpoints included comparisons between treatment groups for weight reduction thresholds of ≥5 to ≥30%, and changes in waist circumference (WC) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Safety and tolerability were assessed. Data are for the trial product estimand unless otherwise specified.

**Results:**
In total, 3417 pts (CagriSema: n=2108, sema: n=302, cagri: n=302, pbo: n=705), mainly female (67.6%) and White (72.0%) with a mean age, BW, BMI and WC of 47 years, 106.9 kg, 37.9 kg/m and 114.7 cm, respectively, were randomised. BW reductions at week 68 were greater for CagriSema (−22.7%) vs sema (−16.1%), cagri (−11.8%) and pbo (−2.3%); the estimated treatment difference (ETD) for CagriSema vs pbo was −20.4% (95% CI −21.1, −19.7; p<0.001) (Fig A). For the treatment policy estimand, BW reductions were −20.4% vs −14.9%, −11.5% and −3.0%, respectively; the ETD for CagriSema vs pbo was −17.4% (95% CI −18.1, −16.6; p<0.001). Pts receiving CagriSema had greater achievement of BW reductions of ≥5 to ≥30% than those receiving sema, cagri or pbo (all p<0.0001) (Fig B). The ETDs in WC and SBP for CagriSema vs pbo were −15.4 cm (95% CI −16.2, −14.6) and −8.8 mmHg (95% CI −9.9, −7.8) (both p<0.0001). AEs were mainly gastrointestinal, experienced by 79.6% in the CagriSema group vs 73.8%, 54.0% and 39.9% in the sema, cagri and pbo groups, respectively; most were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity.

**Conclusion:**
CagriSema provided robust and clinically meaningful weight reduction in adults with overweight and obesity, superior to sema or cagri alone, with a well-tolerated safety profile consistent with other incretin-based therapies.

**Proteomics of hepatocytes revealed that the GLP-1 / GCG recep- tor dual agonist IB1362 improved lipid and energy metabolism in palmitic acid/oleic acid-induced MAFLD model**

J. Zhou

**Background and aims:**
IB1362 is a GLP-1/GCG receptor dual ago- nist that has been proven to reduce blood glucose in mice. However, whether it can ameliorate Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is unclear. This study aims to explore the effect and potential mechanism of IB1362 on MAFLD in hepatocytes, which may provide new ideas for the treatment of MAFLD.

**Materials and methods:**
We established a fatty liver model induced by palmitic acid (PA)/oleic acid(OA) in HepG2 and AML-12 cells. The cell growth was assessed using the CCK8 assay. The intracellular lipid droplets were qualitatively and quantitatively detected by Oil Red O staining and triglyceride (TG) measurement. Proteomics and Western blotting were used to explore the potential molecular mechanisms.

**Results:**
Our results showed that a concentration of 100 nM of the drug significantly rescued lipid accumulation induced by PA/OA. Pro- teomics results (divided into three groups: solvent group, PA/OA + 100 nM IB1362 group, and PA/OA group) revealed that compared to the PA group, there were 231 differentially expressed proteins in the drug-treated group; compared to the solvent group, 253 proteins were differentially expressed in the PA group (P < 0.05). Among these, 88 proteins overlapped between the 231 and 253 proteins. Pathway enrich- ment analysis of these overlapping proteins indicated that they were mainly involved in lipid droplet metabolism, mitochondrial matrix, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Among them, proteins involved in the lipid droplets pathway, such as Perilipin-2 (PLIN2) and Ras-related protein Rab-18(RAB18) were significantly downregulated after drug treatment, while proteins involved in the TCA cycle were upregulated.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the GLP-1/GCG receptor dual agonist IB1362 may improve PA/OA-induced MAFLD by affecting lipid droplets and energy metabolism, which may provide new ideas for the treatment of MAFLD.

**Background and aims:**
Incretin mimetics have been used as an effi- cient strategy to treat type 2 diabetes for years. The interest in their use is attributed to their potential to enhance glycemic control, promote weight loss, and reduce fat liver content (steatosis). It remains unclear whether improvement of the steatotic state is only due to weight loss or if incretin mimetics are also able to modulate metabolic parameters. The primary purpose of this work was to assess the ability of incretin mimetics to improve metabolic parameters thereby reducing steatosis in obese/diabetic mice. The second aim was to evaluate if GIPR and GLP-1R agonist, tirzepatide was more effective to counteract steatosis than either GIPR or GLP-1R agonist alone.

**Materials and methods:**
Mice were fed with either normolipidic (NLD) or a High Fat Diet (HFD: 60% fat). Then, HFD mice were treated for 28 days with GLP1R agonist (Dulaglutide-DUL), GIPR agonist (LAGIPRA-LAG) or GIPR and GLP-1R agonist (Tirzepatide- TZP). Liver steatosis was estimated using histology staining and bio- chemistry. Inflammation was measured using mRNA expression and insulin signaling pathway was evaluated through expression of key proteins.

**Results:**
While single agonists DUL and LAG were able to reduce weight in mice to the same extent (12%), TZP showed a greater potency (18%). The same pattern was observed concerning reduction of steato- sis. DUL, LAG and TZP was associated with a reduction in the number of lipid droplets, total lipid area and total triglyceride content in the liver (Figure 1).Livers of incretin mimetics-treated mice displayed a reduced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines Il1β, TNFα and ccl2, and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine Il4, with Tirze- patide demonstrating the most pronounced effect. Finally, the obesity/ diabetes induced reduction in the expression of insulin signaling path- way key proteins (p-AKT and PI3K) was restored in part by DUL and LAG and almost entirely by TZP.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that reduction of steatosis in obese/diabetic mice was not only due to weight loss but also to the incretin mimetics ability to influence metabolism by reducing inflam- mation and improving the insulin signaling pathway. Notably, Tirzepa- tide was associated with the most potent effect in this regard.

**Background and aims:**
In randomized controlled trials, sodium- glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improved cardiovascu- lar, kidney, and mortality outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Because these studies generally excluded patients treated with immunosuppressant drugs, whether SGLT2 inhibitors are safe and effective in patients using systemic glucocorticoids is unknown.

**Materials and methods:**
In a real-world prospective cohort study, we used the TriNetX network with access to patients’ data in 146 healthcare organizations worldwide. We propensity-score matched adults with T2D and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)>30mL/min/1.73 ­m , treated with oral glucocorticoids, who initiated treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors (1:1) between January 2015 and December 2021. The main outcomes were all-cause death, and a composite kidney outcome comprised of a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 or worse, initiation of dialysis, and eGFR<30 ml/min/1.73 ­m at the final assessment. Another composite outcome comprised of a diagnosis of CKD stage 5 or worse, initiation of dialysis, and eGFR<15 ml/min/1.73 ­m at the final assessment. These compos- ite outcomes were evaluated alone, and in a composite outcome including all-cause death. Safety outcomes included a diagnosis of volume depletion, hyponatremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, genital tract infections (in women), urinary tract infections, new osteoporosis, fractures, and amputations. We assessed the rate ratio with 95% confidence interval using the Wald method with log transformation.

**Results:**
The study included 9090 propensity-score matched patients (3906 women, mean age 60.1 years, and mean eGFR 82.4 mL/ min/1.73 ­m ). All-cause death occurred among 315 (7.8%) and 433 (10.7%) patients who initiated SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibi- tors, respectively (RR 0.73 [95% CI 0.64-0.84]). The composite kidney outcome occurred in 421 (10.4%) and 518 (12.8%) patients, respectively (RR 0.81 [95%CI 0.72-0.92]). The respective numbers of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and genital tract infections with SGLT2 inhibitors versus DPP4 inhibitors were 67 versus 59 and 125 versus 119 (Figure).

**Conclusion:**
In a global real-world cohort of patients with T2D treated with systemic glucocorticoids, initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors versus DPP4 inhibitors was associated with a lower rate of all-cause death, with evidence suggesting kidney benefits.

**Impact of increased SGLT2 inhibitor initiation on HbA , weight, and diabetes complications across age and frailty subgroups in the UK, 2019-2024**

M.M. Dinsdale, Jones, T.J. McKinley, B.M. Shields, K.G. Young, J.M. Dennis

**Background and aims:**
SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use as second-line type 2 diabetes therapy is increasing worldwide, but data on the impact of these prescribing changes are limited. We aimed to describe con- temporary time-trends in SGLT2i prescribing in the UK, overall and across subgroups defined by age and frailty, and associated trends in 12-month glycaemic response, weight change, and short-term diabetes- related complications.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied 94,435 people with type 2 dia- betes initiating second-line treatment after metformin in population- representative UK primary care data (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) from Jan-2019 to Jun-2024. Outcomes were assessed for the whole cohort and by three age and frailty subgroups: age ≤70 years (n=68,099 [72%]), non-frail >70 (n=15,270 [16%]), and frail >70 (n=11,066 [12%]). Frailty was measured using the electronic frailty index. Prescribing trends were calculated per calendar year as the pro- portion of SGLT2i initiations of all second-line initiations. Outcomes were also evaluated by calendar year of drug initiation (2019-2023), allowing for 12-month follow-up post initiation to assess treatment outcomes. Trends in response outcomes, comprising mean 12-month changes in HbA1c and weight from baseline, were estimated using linear regression models adjusted for clinical characteristics including baseline HbA1c, BMI, sex, diabetes duration, ethnicity, and depriva- tion. Trends in two separate complication outcomes, comprising hos- pital admissions for heart failure, and acute diabetes complications (severe diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia), were estimated using Poisson regression, adjusted for the same clinical characteristics.

**Results:**
Second-line SGLT2i initiation increased rapidly (2019: 26% of initiations; 2024: 63% of initiations), and this increase was most marked in the frail >70 group (2019: 6%; 2024: 60%). Overall changes by calendar year in HbA1c response and weight change were modest. Mean HbA1c response improved from -10.6 (95% CI: -10.9, -10.3) mmol/mol in 2019 to -12.0 (95% CI: -12.3, -11.7) mmol/mol in 2023 (p<0.001). Mean weight loss increased from -1.6 (95% CI: -1.7, -1.5) kg in 2019 to -2.6 (95% CI: -2.7, -2.5) kg in 2023 (p<0.001). There was no evidence of changes over time in risk of heart failure hospitalisation (incidence rate ratio [IRR] per calendar year: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.98,1.2; p=0.15) or acute diabetes complications (IRR per year: 1.2; 95% CI: 0.9,1.4; p=0.22). Trends by calendar year for response and complica- tion outcomes were consistent across all subgroups, including in the frail >70 group (p-values between all subgroup differences >0.05).

**Conclusion:**
A rapid increase in the use of SGLT2i as second-line therapy has been seen in the UK over the last five years, most marked in older adults with frailty where SGLT2i initiations have increased 10-fold. This major prescribing change was associated with modest population-level improvements in glycaemic response and weight change, with no evidence of changes in short-term complication risk.

**SGLT-2 inhibitor-induced erythrocytosis and risk of incident car- diovascular disease in type 2 diabetes: a nationwide cohort study**

A. Gosmanov

**Background and aims:**
Treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with SGLT-2 inhibitors can lead to increased risk of incident erythrocytosis (ERY). Pre-SGLT-2i era studies showed that in non-diabetic individu- als incident ERY is associated with heightened cardiovascular (CV) risk. The aim of this investigation was to assess risk of incident coro- nary artery disease (CAD) and stroke in T2D persons with new diag- nosis of ERY including those who developed SGLT-2i-induced ERY.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a retrospective nationwide cohort study of US Veterans with T2D who received care between 3/2013- 12/2023. Inclusion criteria were complete medical records data, nor- mal baseline hematocrit (Hct)<50.0% measured within 1 year before the study onset, adequate adherence with SGLT-2i based on the pro- portion of days covered >80%, no testosterone prescription, and no history of prior ERY or CV disease. We identified 2 groups: control patients (no record of SGLT-2i use at anytime) and new SGLT-2i users; in all patients we followed Hct for 1 year to identify those who developed new ERY defined as Hct≥50%. Primary endpoint was odds ratio (OR) of incident non-fatal CAD or stroke calculated by logistic regression model adjusted for case-mix. This study was approved by local ethics committee.

**Results:**
We identified 691104 patients mostly males (94.5%) and Caucasians (Whites 70.2% and Blacks 19.4%). All patients in the SGLT-2i group were initiated on preferred agent empagliflozin. The SGLT-2i use resulted in significant and expected HbA1c reduc- tion and Hct increase compared with the control group (Table). In adjusted analyses, absolute incidence of ERY was 5.0-fold higher (P<0.0001) in SGLT-2i-treated group compared with control patients (10.6% vs 2.3%, respectively). In the whole cohort, 1.2% developed incident CAD and 1.9% of patients were diagnosed with stroke during 1 year of observation. In the models adjusted for baseline Hct, HbA1c, age, ethnicity, sex, BMI, eGFR, sleep apnea, concomitant hypoglycemic agent use, and smoking status, new-onset ERY in both control and SGLT-2i-treated patients was associated with equally and significantly higher probability of incident CAD compared with control T2D patients who maintained Hct<50% throughout the study (Table). Risk of stroke was higher in the control patients who devel- oped ERY and SGLT-2i therapy did not significantly affect the odds of incident stroke compared with control patients (Table).

**Conclusion:**
In this study of people with T2D receiving care in real world setting, we demonstrated two novel findings. First, a new diagnosis of ERY is directly associated with incident CAD ans stroke and, secondly, that SGLT-2i therapy does reduce risk of ERY- induced incident CAD. Considering that people with T2D overall and, more specifically, 10% of SGLT-2i-treated patients will develop new ERY that is accompanied by higher CV risk, we recommend implementation of strategies to monitor Hct trends from onset of gliflozin therapy initiation and, if ERY identified, to institute strate- gies to promptly address this laboratory finding.

**Background and aims:**
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) induce glucosuria potentially leading to infection and inflammation in the preputial micro-environment. Phimosis, constric- tion of the prepuce, occurs with increased frequency in males with type 2 diabetes and is often caused by genital infections and inflamma- tion. Phimosis is known to increase the risk of penile cancer. Data on these outcomes in SGLT2i users are very scarce. We aimed to examine the risks of phimosis and penile cancer in men with type 2 diabetes initiating SGLT2is versus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs).

**Materials and methods:**
This population-based cohort study used high-quality medical databases to emulate a target trial including all adult male metformin users initiating SGLT2is or GLP-1RAs in Den- mark between 2016 and 2021. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to balance 41 confounders and estimated weighted intention- to-treat risks and risk ratios of phimosis and penile cancer.

**Results:**
We included 32,486 new SGLT2i users and 14,793 new GLP- 1RA users. The risk of phimosis within the first year was higher in SGLT2i users compared to GLP-1RA users (0.9% versus 0.5%), and the risk difference continued to accumulate over time (8-year cumulative risks 4.8% versus 3.6%), corresponding to a 1-year risk ratio of 1.88 (95% CI, 1.43 to 2.47) and an 8-year risk ratio of 1.36 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.61). Cases of penile cancer during 8 years were rare but occurred more commonly among SGLT2i initiators (0.09% versus 0.01% in GLP-1RA initiators) (Figure 1), with an 8-year risk ratio of 6.34 (95% CI, 1.16 to 34.52). The figure shows the weighted cumulative risk of a) phimosis and b) penile cancer with initiation of SGLT2i and GLP-1RA.

**Conclusion:**
SGLT2i use was associated with an elevated risk of phi- mosis in men with type 2 diabetes compared to GLP-1RA use. Our results also suggest a potential long-term concern regarding penile cancer for SGLT2i use, although the absolute risk remains very low.

**Mortality and persistence in therapy in elderly patients treated with gliflozines vs incretins**

A. Del Zoppo

**Background and aims:**
SGLT2inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) reduce all-cause mortality and improve cardiovas- cular and renal prognosis in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Data on clinical outcomes and tolerability in elderly individuals are scarce. We performed a retrospective real-life study to compare SGLT2i vs GLP1-RA in >80 yrs old T2D subjects who started one of these thera- pies after 75 years of age.

**Materials and methods:**
We collected data of 207 subjects con- secutively receiving SGLT2i or GLP1-RA based on clinical indica- tion, stratified according to their age at first prescription: 75-80 yrs ­(SGLT2i and GLP1-RA ) or ≥80 yrs ­(SGLT2i and GLP1- RA ). Clinical and biochemical data were collected at baseline (T0) and yearly until 60 months or death. Vital status of participants was retrieved in January 2025.

**Results:**
The final cohort included 156 individuals on SGLT2i and 51 individuals on GLP1-RA (35.2% vs 52.9% females), among whom 26 (12.6%) deaths occurred. At T0, subjects on SGLT2i were older (81.6±3.7 vs 79.8±2.6 yrs, p=0.002) and showed lower BMI (27.9±4.8 vs 33.3±6.3 kg/m , p<0.0001) and lower triglycerides (99 [75-140] vs 149 [95-189] mg/dl, p= 0.005). No difference emerged in T2D dura- tion, HbA1c, LDL cholesterol and eGFR. The SGLT2i group showed similar mortality (p=0.385) and persistence in therapy (p=0.269) as compared with GLP1-RA. When stratified by age at first prescrip- tion, mortality was numerically lower in ­SGLT2i compared with GLP1-RA (HR 0.14, 95% CI [0.01; 1.32], p=0.085), but higher in ­SGLT2i than GLP1-RA (HR 3.48, 95% CI [0.81; 14.92], p=0.093) (Figure 1A). Discontinuation of therapy after 80 yrs was sim- ilar between ­SGLT2i and GLP1-RA (p=0.319) but greater in ­SGLT2i compared with GLP1-RA (HR 3.61, 95% CI [1.09; 12.00], p=0.036) (Figure 1B).

**Conclusion:**
Starting SGLT2i after 80 years was associated with greater treatment discontinuation compared with GLP1-RA. A reduced persistence in therapy with SGLT2i in more elderly individuals may explain the observed opposite trends of mortality between treatments.

**Background and aims:**
Treatment with sodium-glucose cotrans- portes-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of both cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recent findings indicate that the human renal cortex is and insulin-sensitive tissue. In obese individuals, both during fasting and hyperinsulinemic stimulation, the kidney exhibits lower 18Fluoro- deoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) uptake rates compared to lean individu- als, possibly due to insulin resistance. This study aims to evaluate changes in renal [18F]-FDG uptake in T2D patients following short- term treatment with dapagliflozin and to assess the long-term effects on kidney function after a four-year follow-up.

**Materials and methods:**
In our DAPAHeart Trial, a single-center, four-week, prospective, double-blind, controlled study, we enrolled T2D patients with stable coronary artery disease and preserved glo- merular filtration rates (eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73m2). Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either dapagliflozin (10 mg daily) or a placebo alongside their standard treatment. Position emis- sion tompraphy (PET) scans using [18F]-FDG were performed during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC) to measure regional FDG uptake before and after the four- week treatment with SGLT-2i. After the trial, the placebo group initiated dapagliflozin therapy, and both groups were followed for four years.

**Results:**
After the four-week treatment, the SGLT-2i group showed a significant reduction in renal standardized uptake value (SUV) expressed as peak activity concentrations (SUVpeak; p=0.045) com- pared to the placebo group, with trends toward reductions in SUVmax and SUVmean. Additionally, long-term follow-up data revealed that four years of dapagliflozin treatment was associated with stable eGFR (pre-treatment: 81.4 ± 6.4 ml/min; post-treatment: 76.2 ± 6 ml/min; p=0.4).

**Conclusion:**
Short-term treatment with dapagliflozin is associated with a reduction in renal SUVpeak, indicating decreased glucose uptake during an insulin-stimulated state (insulin clamp). While the causes of this reduction require further investigation, it is suggested that SGLT-2 inhibition decreases tubular energy requirements and glucose uptake, contributing to kidney function preservation, as confirmed by the four- year follow-up.

**Evaluating SCORE2-diabetes for cardiovascular risk prediction in type 1 diabetes: insights from the Swedish National Diabetes Register**

S. Karayiannides

2. (KI), Stockholm, Sweden, Center for Diabetes, Academic Specialist

**Background and aims:**
Individuals with type 1 diabetes have an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several cardiovascular risk algorithms have been developed for type 1 diabetes. However, the most widely recognized and guideline-implemented risk calculator in Europe is SCORE2-Diabetes but designed to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk only in individuals with type 2 diabetes. This study aims to evaluate whether SCORE2-Diabetes can also be used to iden- tify high-risk individuals for cardiovascular events in type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We collected data on all patients with type 1 diabetes registered in the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR) between 2006 and 2015. Individuals aged 40-69 years old with no established CVD were included, in line with SCORE2-Diabetes intended use for type 2 diabetes. Only those with complete clinical data required for SCORE2-Diabetes calculation at baseline were included. Information from the National Cause of Death Register and the National Patient Register (NPR) was used for description of baseline characteristics and outcome assessment. Patients were followed for the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as the first occurrence of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischae- mic stroke, or all-cause death, until 31 December 2016 (mean follow- up: 8.8 years). Cox regression analysis stratified by SCORE2-Diabetes risk categories (low, moderate, high, very high) was used to calculate Hazard Ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).

**Results:**
The study cohort included 15 514 individuals with type 1 diabetes, of whom 6 793 (43.8%) were female. Based on SCORE2- Diabetes classification, 2 495 (16.1%) were categorized as low risk, 5 191 (33.5%) as moderate risk, 5 762 (37.1%) as high risk and 2 066 (13.3%) as very high risk. The median age was 53 years (IQR: 46-60), median HbA1c was 52 mmol/mol (IQR: 46-65), and median BMI was 25.3 (IQR: 23.0-28.0). Microvascular complications were prevalent, including retinopathy (62.9%), albuminuria (19.8%) and neuropathy (26.1%). Compared to the low-risk group, the HR for MACE was 2.2 (95% CI:1.8-2.8) in the moderate-risk group, 5.4 (95% CI:4.3-6.6) in the high-risk group, and 13.1 (95% CI:10.5-16.2) in the very high-risk group (Figure). Differences in HRs between the groups were statisti- cally significant (p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
SCORE2-Diabetes effectively stratifies cardiovascular risk in individuals with type 1 diabetes, demonstrating a clear gradi- ent in MACE incidence across risk categories. These findings suggest that despite being developed for type 2 diabetes, SCORE2-Diabetes may serve as a useful tool for identifying high-risk individuals in type 1 diabetes. Further studies are needed to optimize risk prediction and guide preventive strategies in this population.

1. Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong,
2. Hong Kong, Department of Sugery, The University of Hong Kong,
3. Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Here, we validated and compared the performance of the new Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events (PREVENT) equations (Full and glycated haemoglobin, HbA1c models), the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) Diabetes model, and the conventional Framingham Risk Score (FRS) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Hong Kong.

**Materials and methods:**
We identified 234846 T2D patients (52.33% women) without known CVD between 1 January 2010 and 31 Decem- ber 2012 from the territory wide electronic health record system in Hong Kong. We first validated each cardiovascular prediction equa- tion according to the specified target age ranges and CVD endpoints. Next, we included 120182 patients with complete dataset available across all four cardiovascular prediction models to directly compare their performance in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Model performance was assessed by discrimination and cali- bration. Pairwise comparisons of prediction models were conducted using DeLong tests.

**Results:**
In validation of individual cardiovascular equation, the PRE- VENT (Full) equation demonstrated the highest area under the curve (AUC) (0.734, 95%CI 0.728 0.741 for men and 0.792, 95%CI 0.785 0.798 for women), while AUCs of the other equations ranged from 0.617 to 0.715 for men and 0.644 to 0.785 for women. In direct com- parison of the four equations, the PREVENT (Full) equation outper- formed the other three in predicting MACE at 10 years. Recalibration improved the observed/expected (O/E) ratios of the PREVENT (Full) equation from 0.421 (0.420 0.422) to 1.036 (1.034 1.038) in women, and from 0.469 (0.468 0.470) to 1.057 (1.055 1.059) in men with similar discrimination performance. Decision curve analysis further demonstrated clinical benefits of the recalibrated model.

**Conclusion:**
The PREVENT (Full) equation, which incorporates urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) and HbA1c, demonstrated superior performance in men and women, and should be the equation to use for CVD risk prediction in T2D patients.

2. zil, Department of Medicine, ABS School of Medicine, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Accurate identification of those at higher risk through validated risk stratification tools is essential for guiding preventive strategies. However, the agreement between cardiovascular (CV) risk models has been scarcely studied. This study aimed to compare the performance of the Steno Type 1 Risk Engine (ST1RE) and the Scottish-Swedish risk model in a predominantly young and ethnically heterogeneous cohort of individuals with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective study included 435 adults with T1D and no prior CVD. Participants were stratified into low (<10%), moderate (10-19.9%), and high risk (≥20%) for 10-year fatal or nonfatal CV events by both models. Their comparative performance for predicting 10-year CV events was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression, ROC curves, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Agreement between models was evaluated using Cohen’s kappa.

**Results:**
Among the 435 individuals included, the median age was 25 years (IQR: 21–32), with 86% being under 40 years old, and the median T1D duration was 13 years (IQR: 9–18). The Scottish-Swedish model classified 75% as low risk, 13% as moderate, and 12% as high risk. In contrast, ST1RE classified 84% as low, 11% as moderate, and 5% as high risk. Agreement between models was moderate (κ = 0.550; 95% CI: 0.468-0.632). Over a median follow-up of 9.2 years (IQR: 6.0-10.7), 24 participants (5.5%) experienced CV events. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses showed significantly higher event rates in moderate- and high-risk groups for both models. The C-statistic for the Scottish-Swedish model was 0.916 (95% CI: 0.865-0.968), comparable to that of ST1RE (p = 0.986) (Figure 1A). Both models demonstrated good calibration (Figure 1B).

**Conclusion:**
In this ethnically mixed and predominantly young T1D cohort, both the ST1RE and the Scottish-Swedish models demonstrated strong discriminative ability and good calibration for 10-year CV risk prediction. These findings underscore the importance of T1D-specific tools to guide primary prevention strategies.

**Estimated glucose disposal rate and risk of first myocardial infarc- tion in people with diabetes**

L. Glynn

1. Karolinska Institutet Södersjukhuset, Stockholm, Sweden, Institute

**Background and aims:**
Insulin resistance is linked to a higher risk of CVD and mortality in people with diabetes. Estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) has been proposed as a clinical proxy of insulin resistance, incorporating glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, and BMI or waist circumference. This study aimed to assess whether eGDR is associated with an increased risk of first myocardial infarction (MI) and post-MI mortality in people with diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Using data from merged national health care registers between 2006 and 2020, individuals with type 1 diabe- tes and type 2 diabetes were identified at first complete registration of ­eGDR and categorized based on eGDR <4, 4-5.99, 6-7.99 and >8 mg/kg/min. Follow-up continued until the first MI, after which individuals were further followed until death or the end of the study (2022). Relative risks of MI and death were estimated as sex and age as well as multivariate adjusted HRs with 95% CIs using Cox regression. Individuals with type 2 diabetes and eGDR >8 mg/kg/ min (representing the highest insulin sensitivity) served as the refer- ence group.

**Results:**
We identified 46 155 individuals with type 1 diabetes (43% women) and 570 230 individuals with type 2 diabetes (43% women). At baseline, people with type 1 diabetes were younger (mean age 37 years), had higher HbA1c (mean 64.3 mmol/mol) and longer duration of diabetes (mean 18.4 years) than people with type 2 diabetes (mean age 65 years, mean HbA1c 54.3 mmol/mol, mean diabetes duration 4.4 years). A total of 1 997 (4.3%) MI cases were observed in individuals with type 1 diabetes, compared to 34 237 (6.0%) cases in those with type 2 diabetes. The crude incidence rate per 10 000 person years for MI in type 1 diabetes was 77.4, 61.9, 31.5 and 5.4 across categories eGDR <4, 4, 4-5.99, 6-7.99 and >8 mg/kg/min, respectively. For type 2 diabetes, the corresponding rates were 84.3, 83.2, 74.0 and 35.8. Age and sex adjusted analy- ses showed that the risk of first MI increased with lower eGDR in both diabetes types, with a stronger association in type 1 diabetes (Figure 1). After multivariate adjustments HRs (95% CIs) for type 1 diabetes was: 3.73 (3.35-4.16), 3.09 (2.85-3.35), 2.40 (2.15-2.69) and 0.96 (0.79-1.17) in categories eGDR <4, 4, 4-5.99, 6-7.99 and >8 mg/kg/min, respectively. Corresponding HRs for type 2 diabe- tes was 1.71 (1.62-1.82), 1.54 (1.46-1.62), 1.43 (1.35-1.51) and 1 (reference) for categories eGDR <4, 4, 4-5.99, 6-7.99 and >8 mg/ kg/min, respectively. However, no association was found between eGDR and mortality.

**Conclusion:**
Decreasing eGDR, a proxy for insulin resistance, is asso- ciated with an increased risk of first MI, with the most pronounced impact observed in individuals with type 1 diabetes. However, eGDR does not appear to influence mortality following MI. These findings underscore the importance of further research determining the intri- cate relationship between insulin resistance and CVD in people with diabetes.

**Age-related difference in the impact of diabetes on all-cause mor- tality after acute myocardial infarction**

P.-S. Song

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is highly prevalent among individuals hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is associated with increased risk for long-term mortality. We sought to test the hypothesis that the impact of DM on clinical outcomes after AMI can vary by age.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 12,600 AMI patients from the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry-National Institute of Health (KAMIR-NIH) between November 2011 and December 2015 was classified into young (n = 3,590 [29%]) and old (n = 9,010 [72%]). Those less than 55 years of age were considered young. We performed comparisons of baseline characteristics, in-hospital treatments, and 3-year clinical outcomes between patients with and without diabetes after stratification according to age group.

**Results:**
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 27% in the young AMI group. In the multivariable adjusted model of the entire cohort, diabetes mellitus was associated strongly with 3-year all-cause mortal- ity (13% vs. 6.8%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.318; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.138-1.526; P<0.001). When the entire cohort was sub- divided into two age groups, young diabetic patients showed a 107% higher mortality rate than those without diabetes (adjusted HR, 2.07 [1.15-3.72]; P = 0.015). Meanwhile, old diabetic patients had a 25% higher risk of mortality than non-diabetic patients (adjusted HR, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004). The interaction of diabetes with age was sig- nificant (adjusted P for interaction = 0.008).

**Conclusion:**
Diabetes mellitus is not uncommon in younger AMI patients, and the relative risk of 3-year mortality is significantly higher in young patients than in older counterparts. More aggressive treat- ments are needed to prevent future cardiovascular events in younger patients after AMI.

**Background and aims:**
A younger age at diagnosis of diabetes is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). People with diabetes had worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic but the impact of COVID-19 on the association between age at diagnosis of diabetes and CVD is unknown. We aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on CVD incidence by age at diagnosis of diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Whole population pseudonymised linked electronic health records including primary care, hospitalisation, mor- tality, COVID-19 infection and vaccination data were accessed through the NHS Secure Data Environment in England. Analyses included peo- ple aged 40 years and over, registered with a general practitioner in England and without prior CVD on January ­1 2022. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for ten cardiovascular outcomes including angina, coronary heart disease (CHD), arrythmias, heart failure (HF), stroke, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and three composite CVDs separately for type 2 and type 1 diabetes by age at diagnosis and to test for interaction with COVID-19 diagnosis. Analyses were stratified by sex and region and adjusted for age, ethnicity, deprivation, BMI, smoking and vaccina- tion status.

**Results:**
Among 24,733,400 people included in the study, 1,971,315 (8%) had type 2 diabetes, 92,805 (0.4%) had type 1 diabetes and 3,575,390 (14.5%) had a previous record of a COVID-19 diagnosis. The percentage of people with type 2 diabetes diagnosed at ages <30, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80+ years were 1%, 9%, 26%, 31%, 22%, 9% and 2% respectively. Corresponding percentages for type 1 diabetes were 54%, 23%, 14%, 6%, 2%, 1%, and 0%. We found strong dose-response associations between earlier age at diagnosis of both type 2 and type 1 diabetes and increased risk of CVD outcomes. When examining continuous associations per decade earlier age of diagnosis we found statistically significant interactions between prior COVID-19 and age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for arrythmias, CHD, HF, stroke and composite CVD outcomes, indicating higher HRs per decade among those with prior COVID-19 (p < 0.005), mainly observed at younger ages of type 2 diabetes diagnosis.

**Conclusion:**
Analysis of nation-wide linked health records has enabled our powerfully study of the contemporary epidemiology of CVD inci- dence in England post COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on diabetes. We found strong relationships between age at diagnosis of diabetes and incidence of CVDs. A prior COVID-19 diagnosis was related to higher risk of CVD following type 2 diabetes in those diagnosed at an earlier age. Our findings highlight the continued need for public health approaches to prevent early onset of diabetes in the general population.

**Hypoglycaemia frequency and glycaemic control during exercise in**

**Background and aims:**
Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems are proven to be effective and safe in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, managing physical activity (PA) with AID remains com- plex, even with glycemic setting adjustments and recent EASD/ISPAD guidelines. The RAPPID study evaluated real-life management of PA in T1D patients using AID systems, focusing on hypoglycemic event and adherence to guidelines

**Materials and methods:**
A 4-week prospective, multicenter, non-interven- tional study involved T1D patients using AID systems and performing at least 2 weekly PA sessions of ≥30 minutes. Patients documented their PA sessions (aerobic, anaerobic, mixed), adaptative measures (system settings, CHO intake), clinical hypoglycemia occurrence, hypoglycemia treatments. Data from AID systems were combined with PA logs. Primary endpoint assessed time below range (TBR1 <70 mg/dL and TBR2 <54 mg/dL) across 5 periods: pre-PA (2h), PA, early recovery (3h post-PA), late recov- ery (up to 8 a.m. next day), and outside PA sessions. Results expressed as mean±SD, percentages

**Results:**
Eighty-six patients participated: Medtronic 780G (n=39), Tandem CIQ (n=25), CamAPS Fx (n=22); 57% male, aged 42.5±14.3 yrs, BMI=25.4±3.5 kg/m², diabetes duration=23.6±13.2 yrs, AID use=18.3±11.7 months, HbA1c=6.9±0.6%. Over 30 days, participants recorded 12.8±6.8 PA sessions, lasting 1.5±1.1 h (<1h: 30%; 1-2h: 48%; >2h: 22%). Among 954 PA sessions, 191 (20%) were associated with patients reported hypoglycemia: level 1 ([54-70] mg/dL) in 125 sessions (65.4%) and level 2 (<54 mg/dL) in 66 (34.6%). Hypogly- cemic events occurred during aerobic PA (74%), anaerobic PA (5%), mixed PA (16%), unspecified PA (5%). Most occurred during (44%) or after PA (33%). Guidelines adherence was low, 84.9% of PA sessions deviating from the recommendations. Exercise mode was activated in 73.4% of sessions, with activation < 1 h before PA in 51% or during PA in 12%. Pre-PA CHO intake was reported in 35.8% of sessions (24.8±13.3g). During PA, CHO intake occurred in 26.9% of sessions (33.8±23.0g). Time in range (TIR) and TBR1/2 during one month outside PA were 72/2/1%. TIR/TBR1/TBR2 were 73/1/0% in pre-PA; 69/4/2% during PA; 69/4/1% in early and 76/2/1% in late recovery. Aerobic sessions showed higher hypoglycemic events during PA and early recovery, while anaerobic sessions showed events only during early recovery (fig.). Finally, temporary PA cessation was required in 18.8% of hypoglycemic events, definitive cessation in 12%

**Conclusion:**
This study provides the first precise evaluation of hypogly- cemic risks during PA in T1D patients using AID systems, highlighting guideline inconsistencies for algorithm and food adjustments. Findings may enhance insulin algorithms and nutritional strategies for PA

**Time below range alone is insufficient to identify severe hypogly- caemia risk in type 1 diabetes: the critical role of hypoglycaemia**

**Background and aims:**
Severe hypoglycemia events (SHE) remain frequent in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) despite advanced dia- betes technologies. We tested whether time below range (<70 or <54 mg/dl (TBR70, TBR54)) were relevant markers of future SHE and how impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) modifies this relationship.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from participants of the Study of the French-speaking Society of Type 1 Diabetes (SFDT1) who used continuous glucose monitoring. IAH was assessed using the Gold Score (≤2=no-IAH, 3=undetermined, ≥4=IAH). SHE frequency was self-reported 12 months after inclusion. We analyzed associations between TBR and SHE using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, social vulnerability, and insulin treatment, including TBR- IAH interactions. We performed spline analyses to explore non-linear risk patterns.

**Results:**
Among 848 SFDT1 participants (mean (SD) age 41.6 (13.3) years; 53.8% female, median (IQR) HbA1c 7.3% (1.1)), SHE preva- lence was 11.7% overall, and 12.1%, 10.2%, 10.6%, and 14.6% for baseline TBR70 categories ≤1%, 1.1-3.9%, 4-6%, and >6%, respec- tively. Compared to individuals with TBR70≤1% and no-IAH, only those with both TBR70>6% and IAH showed a significantly increased SHE risk (OR=3.32, 95% CI [1.40, 7.82]). For TBR54, SHE prevalence was 11.0% and 13.3% for categories <1% and ≥1%, respectively. Only patients with both TBR54≥1% and IAH had a sig- nificantly higher SHE risk (OR=2.99, 95% CI [1.46, 5.92]) compared to those with TBR54<1% and no-IAH. Spline analysis revealed a consistently low SHE risk across TBR70 values in individuals with no-IAH, with a non-linear trend emerging only in those with IAH, highlighting its crucial role on TBR-SHE risk relationship.

**Conclusion:**
SHE remains frequent today in people with T1D despite the use of technology. TBR alone is not discriminative for high-risk SHE, but combining TBR with awareness status identifies those at the highest risk for both TBR70 and TBR54.

**Relationship between time below range and weekly rates of hypo-**

**Background and aims:**
Hypoglycaemia exposure is typically evalu- ated as total exposure over time, using time below range (TBR). Epi- sodic exposure, which can be assessed using rates of hypoglycaemia episodes, may better reflect the lived experiences of people with diabetes. We examined the correlation between TBR and hypogly- caemia episodes experienced by people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), using data from the Hypo-METRICS study.

**Materials and methods:**
For up to 10 weeks, Hypo-METRICS participants wore a blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device and reported episodes of hypoglycaemia using a smartphone app at, or shortly after, each event. We calculated the number of sensor-detected hypoglycaemia (SDH) and person-reported hypo- glycaemia (PRH). SDH3.9 and SDH3.0 episodes were respectively defined as glucose readings <3.9 mmol/L and <3.0 mmol/L for at least 15 minutes. PRHs were defined as symptomatic events resolv- ing on carbohydrate ingestion or a self-measured glucose <4mmol/L. We estimated the relationship between overall TBR and weekly rates of hypoglycaemic events (SDH3.9, SDH3.0 and PRH) using Spear- man’s correlation.

**Results:**
This analysis included 259 participants with T1D (54% women, 90% White, 75% using CGM). Median(IQR) age was 48(30- 57) years and diabetes duration 21(9-34) years. TBR was highly correlated with weekly SDH rates (<3.9mmol/L: r=0.97, p<0.001; <3.0mmol/L: r=0.96, p<0.001). The median SDH3.9 rate was 1.9 events/week for those with ≤2% TBR<3.9 mmol/L compared with 4.9 events/week for those with TBR<3.9 mmol/L between 2-4% (Table 1). Similar patterns were found for TBR<3.0 mmol/L. TBR was also correlated with weekly PRH rates but to a lesser extent (<3.9mmol/L: r=0.45, p<0.001; <3.0mmol/L: r=0.39, p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
There was a strong correlation between TBR and weekly SDH rates. This suggests that TBR could be used to estimate hypoglycaemia event rates and thus, the burden of hypoglycaemia in people with diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Current epidemiologic insights into Level 3 hypoglycaemia in older adults with diabetes remain limited, drawn mainly from non-generalizable trials and health records capturing the <10% of severe events requiring care. Leveraging data from the older adult iNPHORM cohort, we aimed to determine the real-world fre- quency and key sociodemographic and clinical risk factors of Level 3 hypoglycaemia.

**Materials and methods:**
Adults (≥18 years) with self-reported type 1 diabetes or insulin/secretagogue-treated type 2 diabetes were recruited from a US-wide probability-based internet panel. Data related to Level 3 hypoglycaemia were collected via a screener, base- line, and 12 monthly follow-ups. This analysis focused on respondents aged ≥60 years with ≥1 follow-up. We calculated crude incidence pro- portions over follow-up and annualized rates, overall and by diabetes type. Multivariable negative binomial regression with robust standard errors identified risk factors. Variables were selected using a “voting” procedure across 2000 imputed, bootstrapped LASSO models; those selected in >50% were retained in the final model.

**Results:**
We analyzed data from 310 participants (mean age: 67.5 [SD: 5.5] years; male: 53.9%; T1D: 8.7%). The overall incidence propor- tion of Level 3 hypoglycaemia was 20% (95% CI: 16.2-25.2) (T1D: 44.4% [95% CI: 27.6-62.7]; T2D: 18.0% [95% CI: 14.0-22.9]); the annualized rate was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.75-1.56) events per person-year (EPPY) (T1D: 2.09 [95% CI: 1.03-4.24] EPPY; T2D: 0.98 [95% CI: 0.65-1.49] EPPY). The final regression model included sex assigned at birth, education, race, ethnicity, diabetes type, number of diabetes complications, number of diabetes drugs (save insulin/secretagogues), number of diabetes visits (past 30 days), use/duration of real-time con- tinuous/flash glucose monitoring (rt-C/FGM), impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, fear of hypoglycaemia, health literacy, and binge drink- ing frequency. Independent risk factors were female sex (rate ratio [RR]: 2.54 [95% CI: 1.18-5.47], p=0.02), non-White race (RR: 1.90 [95% CI: 0.48-7.47], p=0.009), number of diabetes complications (RR per added complication: 2.12 [95% CI: 1.17-3.85], p=0.01), and rt-C/ FGM use/duration (RR for rt-C/FGM use >1 year vs no use: 5.71 [95% CI: 1.42-22.94], p=0.045).

**Conclusion:**
Our analysis revealed a substantial burden of Level 3 hypoglycaemia in older adults with diabetes. While crude incidence proportions and rates were higher in T1D, diabetes type was not an independent risk factor. Instead, key drivers were non-White race, mul- tiple complications, and prolonged rt-C/FGM use—the latter perhaps reflecting alarm fatigue, fear of hyperglycemia, or unmet support needs. Female sex also emerged as a salient risk factor, warranting further exploration of postmenopausal physiology and gendered experiences. Results underscore the need for tailored, equity-informed risk assess- ment, targeted education, and close follow-up to prevent Level 3 hypo- glycaemia and its potentially catastrophic sequelae in the growing older adult population with diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
People with insulin-treated diabetes have a high degree of anxiety about nocturnal hypoglycaemia. This may be increased in those with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH). We analysed the impact of hypoglycaemia awareness (HA) status on the proportion of hypoglycaemic events that progress from level 1 (L1<3.9mmol/L) to level 2 (L2<3mmol/L) while awake or asleep in people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D).

**Materials and methods:**
Using data from the Hypo-METRICS study, where participants wore blinded continuous glucose monitor- ing devices (CGM) and a FitBit actigraph for 10 weeks, we defined sensor-detected hypoglycaemia (SDH) as 15 minutes below thresh- old, waking/sleeping status by FitBit parameters; normal awareness of hypoglycaemia (NAH) was assessed by Gold<4. A chi-squared test was used to compare the proportion of SDH events progressing from level 1 to level 2 between participants with impaired awareness of hypogly- caemia (IAH, Gold score ≥4) and normal hypoglycaemia awareness (NAH, Gold score <4), during waking and sleeping hours.

**Results:**
We analysed data from 287 PwT2D (median age 63 years, median HbA1c 51 mmol/L, CGM use 43%, IAH=24%). Progression rate from L1 to L2 was higher during sleep vs waking hours within both subgroups: 659/3420=19% vs 414/3644=11%; p<0.001 in peo- ple with NAH; 208/1069=19% vs 130/1143=11%; p<0.001 in people with IAH. Between NAH and IAH, there was no difference in rate progression from L1 to L2 during sleep (NAH=659/3420=19% vs IAH=208/1069=19%, p=0.89), or during waking hours (NAH=11% vs IAH=11%, p=0.99).

**Conclusion:**
Progression from L1 to L2 hypoglycaemia was greater during sleep than waking within both NAH and IAH, possibly related to known lower counter-regulation during sleep. Awareness status did not affect progression from L1 to L2 hypoglycaemia during waking vs. sleeping hours.

**Background and aims:**
Despite the numerous health benefits of a physically active lifestyle, people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) often refrain from physical activity and exercise, mostly due to fear of exercise-induced hypoglycaemia. Therefore, this analysis aimed to investigate the effect of different types of exercise on CGM-derived glucose metrics until 24-hours post-exercise.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 22.254 exercise sessions performed by 234 adults with T1D (63 females, 40 using insulin pen, 126 using insulin pump, 68 using pen or pump) from the digital Diabetes Cockpit research database were used for statistical analyses. Exercise types included cycling (CYC, n=4579), functional strength training (FST, n=816), high intensity interval training (HIT, n=514), rowing (ROW, n=471), running (RUN, n=3006), swimming (SWI, n=418), traditional strength training (TST, n= 2104), walking (WAL, n=10002) and yoga (YOG, n=344) with each exercise type being categorized by quartiles of energy expenditure (EE; kcal) (Q1: very low, Q2: low, Q3: high, Q4: very high). Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn’s multiple compari- sons tests were used to evaluate differences during the post-exercise period (0-24 h) for standard CGM-derived glucose metrics (time below range (TBR, <70 mg/dL), time in range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dL), time above range (TAR, >180 mg/dL), based on the EE quartile classifica- tion. Statistical significance (two-tailed) was accepted at p ≤ 0.05 with multiplicity adjusted p values for each comparison being reported, if possible.

**Results:**
Independent of the type of exercise, median and IQR based on EE quartiles for TIR (Q1-Q4) was 79.0 % (63.2-90-3), 82.0 % (67.4- 92.7), 82.6 % (68.5-92-3) and 80.8% (66.0-90.6). Very low EE was associated with significantly lower TIR compared to low, high (both p<0.0001) and very high EE (p=0.009). For TBR, results were 1.1 % (0.0-4.6), 1.4 % (0.0-5.2), 2.1 % (0.0-6.3) and 2.1 % (0.0-5.9), respec- tively. TBR for very low (Q1) and low (Q2) EE were significantly lower compared to high (Q3) and very high (Q4, all p<0.0001) EE. No statistically significant difference was found between Q3 and Q4 (p<0.99). Regarding TAR, the following values were found (Q1-Q4): 16.6 % (5.2-33.0), 12.8 % (2.4-28.9), 11.9 % (1.8-26-8) and 14.8 % (5.1-28.7), respectively. TAR was significantly higher with very low and very high EE compared to Q2 and Q3 (all p<0.0001). Depend- ing on the type of exercise, TBR was higher with increasing EE (all p<0.01) for WAL. In line with this finding, TAR was significantly lower or tended to be lower with higher EE (all p<0.001). For CYC, TBR in Q3 was significantly higher compared to Q2 (p=0.006) but not Q1 or Q4 (both p<0.99). For RUN, very high EE (Q4) was associated with significantly more TBR compared to very low (Q1, p= 0.03), low (Q2, p=0.05) and high (Q3, p<0.0001) EE. For TST, high (Q3) and very high (Q4) EE was associated with higher TBR compared to very low (Q1) and low EE (Q2, all p<0.0001). For FST, HIT, SWI and YOG no statistically significant differences in TBR based on EE were found.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the total energy expenditure of an exercise ses- sion and the type of exercise, an altered glucose response in the first 24 hours post-exercise can be observed in adults with T1D. While there is an association between TBR and EE for some exercise types, the association for TAR appears to be more heterogenous.

**Background and aims:**
Physical function decline is an increasing risk in people with long-term conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), often encompassing obesity and occurring at a younger age. This can lead to risks of sarcopenia, frailty and decline in overall health. Aims: To evaluate physical function outcomes in people with T2D, based on duration of T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed data from people with T2D in the CODEC study (Chronotype Of patients with Diabetes and Effect on glycaemic Control), a cross-sectional, multisite study examining the impact of chronotype on glycaemia and other biological measures in people with diabetes. Physical function outcomes recorded include short performance physical battery (SPPB) test, timed walk test, chair sit-to-stand time (5STS) and DASI score (Duke Activity Status Index). Linear regression models (adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity) were used to assess the association between T2D duration and physical func- tion outcomes. T2D duration was self-reported in the CODEC study.

**Results:**
1204 participants were assessed (age: 65±12 years, age at diagnosis: 54±14 years, HbA1c 53±15.2 mmol/mol [7±1.4%], T2D duration: 11±11 years, BMI 31±7 kg/m2). Adjusted linear regression models showed that T2D duration was negatively associated with all physical function outcomes, independent of age. More specifically, every 10 years of living with T2D was associated with 0.3 (95% CI -0.4 to -0.16) lower SPPB score, 0.22 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.34) slower gait speed, 0.73 seconds longer chair stand time (95% CI 0.29 to 1.17) and 2.4 point lower DASI score (95% CI -3.48 to -1.33). To put the results into context, a 40-year-old person living with T2D for 20 years will have a clinically significant reduction in 5STS compared to a 60-year- old person with newly diagnosed T2D; and these results are consist- ent with a fitness level expected of an 80-year-old person (without co-morbidities).

**Conclusion:**
T2D duration is independently associated with physical function. Encouraging physical activity and supporting people living with T2D (particularly in those diagnosed at a younger age) may help avoid/reduce early physical function decline and associated metabolic sequalae.

**Background and aims:**
Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to skeletal muscle metabolic impairment and the development of type-2 diabetes. Ageing is associated with skeletal muscle metabolic altera- tions linked to deteriorations in muscle mitochondrial function, making mitochondria a promising target for metabolic health improvements. Although the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) may enhance mitochondrial function, performance, and muscle metabolic profiles, its role in mitigating age-related muscle decline remains unclear. The current study investigated the acute effects of ketosis on metabolic economy, mitochondrial function, and contractile parameters in skeletal muscle of young and older adults.

**Materials and methods:**
Twelve young (20-25 years) and 12 older (65- 85 years) healthy men matched by age-adjusted ­VO max underwent a randomized, crossover, double-blind intervention with ingestion of OHB or placebo on separate study days. Mitochondrial function was assessed in dorsiflexor muscles as oxidative capacity (the rate constant for PCr recovery) by phosphorous MR spectroscopy ( P-MRS) and in quadriceps femoris (biopsies) by high-resolution respirometry, with and without OHB. Based on P-MRS and concurrent measurements of muscle work via a MR-compatible dynamometer, we also assessed metabolic economy, peak power, fatiguability, and muscular pH during four minutes of maximal, dynamic dorsiflexion.

**Results:**
The older group exhibited 33% (95% CI: 3, 42) lower meta- bolic economy than young participants, with no effect of OHB in either group (p > 0.15). Notably, OHB increased ATP consumption by 11% (95% CI: 0, 22) and time-torque derived work capacity by 12% (95% CI: 2, 21) in the older group. Oxidative capacity in the dorsiflexors was similar between groups (95% CI: -0.003, 0.007 ­s ), with no effect of OHB within groups (p > 0.25). In the older group only, OHB improved peak power by 19% (95% CI: 6, 33), increased muscle fatiguability by 10 percentage points (95% CI: 4, 15), and increased contraction- induced muscular acidification by 0.06 a.u. (95% CI: 0.01, 0.10). In quadriceps, complex I+II respiration was 20% (95% CI: 1, 35) lower in the older compared to the young group, with no effect of adding OHB to the protocol.

**Conclusion:**
Acute ketosis increased skeletal muscle work capacity and ATP consumption in older but not young individuals without affecting metabolic economy or overall mitochondrial function. These findings, together with the ketone-induced changes in muscle power, pH, and fatiguability observed only in the older group, suggest an age-specific effect of ketone bodies on skeletal muscle function and metabolism that is independent of changes in mitochondrial function and metabolic economy.

**Background and aims:**
The immune response to a single bout of exercise contributes to skeletal muscle remodeling, but this mecha- nism is poorly understood in type 2 diabetes. Individuals with type 2 diabetes show distinct inflammatory responses to acute exercise com- pared to healthy controls. In men with type 2 diabetes, the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), involved in immune cell recruitment and tissue repair, shows a dysregulated post-exercise response. Skeletal muscle in type 2 diabetes has impaired perfusion during exercise, potentially influencing the inflammatory response. Since hypoxia is a known stimulus for SDF-1/CXCL12 upregulation, we explored its role in mediating the immune response to exercise. Here, we characterized the role of SDF-1/CXCL12 in skeletal muscle remodeling under hypoxic conditions linked to metabolic dysfunc- tion in type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Individuals with type 2 diabetes (8W; 9M) or normal glucose tolerance (10W; 10M) performed 30 minutes of cycling at 85% of maximum heart rate. Plasma samples were col- lected before, immediately after, and three hours post-exercise and analyzed via immunoassay to assess circulating SDF-1/CXCL12 lev- els. In 10-12-week-old C57BL/6JRj male mice, hypoxia in skeletal muscle was induced via femoral artery ligation in one hindlimb. After surgery, mice were assigned to regular water (n=6) or water containing AMD-070 (n=6), a C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4 - CXCL12 receptor) antagonist, from the day of surgery and continuing for ten days post-surgery, when muscle tissue was collected. Cultured skeletal muscle cells were exposed to recombi- nant CXCL12 or siRNA-mediated gene silencing against CXCR4 to down-regulate CXCL12 receptor action. In mouse tissue and muscle cells, myogenic gene expression was evaluated by qPCR.

**Results:**
Our results show circulating CXCL12 differs between indi- viduals with type 2 diabetes and NGT (p=0.0018); NGT individuals had 21.8% higher levels on average, with greater post-exercise differ- ences (p<0.001). This response was blunted in type 2 diabetes. Lev- els also varied by sex, with men showing relatively higher CXCL12. Circulating CXCL12 correlated positively with lean mass (r=0.44; p<0.005) and negatively with HOMA-IR (r=-0.71; p=0.039), the latter remaining significant after adjusting for sex, age, and lean mass. , hypoxia increased CXCR4 mRNA in skeletal muscle after ten days. Hypoxic muscles lost mass compared to the contralat- eral leg, with no difference between treatments (p<0.01). CXCR4 inhibition reduced mRNA in the control leg of treated vs. untreated mice (p=0.06). In cultures muscle cells, CXCR4 silenc- ing during differentiation reduced desmin and increased myostatin mRNA. These findings suggest that CXCL12 signaling influences hypoxia-induced vascular and myogenic responses.

**Conclusion:**
CXCL12 is a hypoxia-responsive cytokine that shows dysregulated levels in response to exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Targeting the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis may promote skeletal muscle tissue remodeling after exercise training by acting on vas- cular and skeletal muscle cells, thereby improving exercise benefits in these individuals.

**Exeriken: a novel exercise-dependent gene regulating glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle**

D. Steffan, M. ­Esposito, C. ­Barison, J.-P. Leduc ­Guadet, S., ­Hussain, D. ­Hammers, M. ­Sandri, A. ­Armani

**Background and aims:**
is facing an evolutionary chal- lenge: for thousands of years, we lived as a physical active animal; however, in just a few decades, we have transitioned into sedentary beings indulging in high-calorie diets. Consequently, metabolic disor- ders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic propor- tions. Although therapeutic advances exist, returning to an active life- style remains the most comprehensive and effective remedy. Recently, Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) has been identified as a skeletal mus- cle glucose metabolism regulator together with mitochondrial bioener- getics, playing a cooperative role in the control of the adaptive response of whole-body metabolism to exercise. Nevertheless, the mechanisms behind the beneficial effects of physical activity through TFEB action are not yet completely understood. Partial responsible for this lack of knowledge is the existence of a “neglected genome” including many annotated protein-coding genes that are still uncharacterized and with unknown function. Identifying neglected molecular players involved in skeletal muscle adaptations to physical activity is fundamental to clarify exercise biology with a focus in the discovery of new potential targets to counteract insulin resistance.

**Materials and methods:**
We conduct experiments exploiting C57BL6/J mice, both wild type and transgenic. Gene expression analy- sis have been conducted via RT-PCR.

**Results:**
To enhance our comprehension of the TFEB and exercise- dependent gene network, we combined datasets cross referencing with a special focus in neglected genes, identifying a unique gene with unknown function that is both exercise and TFEB dependent, here named ExeRiken. Intriguingly, ExeRiken encodes a 124-amino acid protein highly conserved in mammals and we confirmed its translation . Furthermore, ExeRiken transcription is strikingly upregulated during the post-exercise recovery phase, a critical window for metabolic rewiring and nutrient replenishment in muscle fibers. Remarkably, TFEB overexpression robustly boosts ExeRiken transcrip- tion, while knocking down our gene in the same context impairs gly- cogen accumulation, thereby underscoring its pivotal role within the exercise/TFEB glucose-metabolism axis. The importance of ExeRiken in metabolic processes is further highlighted by ExeRiken Knock Out mice, which exhibit a pronounced reduction in muscle glycogen content and a lower Respiratory Exchange Ratio, indicating a metabolic shift toward lipid utilization over carbohydrates.

**Conclusion:**
Collectively, our preliminary data establish ExeRiken as a novel, TFEB-dependent gene that is activated during post-exercise recovery phase and strongly involved in glucose metabolism. Nowa- days, novel therapies based on Glucagon Like Peptide receptor-1 agonist have been widely expanded, revealing impressive weight loss effects; however, they do not normalize insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. For these reasons, the development of potent insu- lin-sensitizing drugs remains an urgent need in type 2 diabetes man- agement. Therefore, investigating novel genes that influence skeletal muscle glucose uptake, such as ExeRiken, is fundamentally important.

**Deciphering molecular pathways of exercise in type 2 diabetes through multi-omic approaches**

**Background and aims:**
Exercise is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, promoting glucose uptake and increasing insulin sensitivity even after a single bout of exercise. Importantly, exercise-stimulated glucose uptake remains intact in individuals with type 2 diabetes, mak- ing exercise an effective glucose-lowering intervention in type 2 dia- betes. We aimed to decipher the molecular mechanisms that mediate the metabolic benefits of exercise in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Eighty-four deeply-phenotyped individuals with and without type 2 diabetes performed a single bout of cycling exercise and muscle biopsies were collected in the rested/fasted state, immediately after exercise, and three hours into rested recovery. We performed proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and metabolomics in skeletal muscle samples and utilized innovative data integration techniques to unravel the molecular regulation of metabo- lism in response to exercise.

**Results:**
We quantified 875 metabolites, 4,366 proteins, and 30,788 phosphosites in skeletal muscle. The multi-omic response to exer- cise was diverse, encompassing muscle contractile processes and myogenesis, macronutrient metabolism, signal transduction, protein localization, extracellular matrix organization, and the immune system. Importantly, exercise achieved a comparable metabolic benefit between sexes and in individuals with or without type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, exercise-responsive pathways targeting critical signaling nodes for glu- cose metabolism and insulin sensitivity remained intact in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In particular, we observed an upregulation of proteins involved in RHO GTPase cycling after exercise, including IQGAP1, which we found to be required for effective glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in human primary myotubes. Conversely, we found that individuals with type 2 diabetes have impaired turnover of the mitochondrial proteome following exercise. In those without type 2 diabetes, exercise recovery was marked by a pronounced downregula- tion of proteins, a response absent in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

**Conclusion:**
Through the integration of proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic data, our study provides a comprehensive temporal analysis of the molecular regulation of metabolism in response to exer- cise. We identified both conserved and dysregulated molecular path- ways in individuals with type 2 diabetes during exercise and in the subsequent recovery phase. These findings reveal novel mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Overall, our results offer insights into the molecular basis of exercise-induced metabolic adaptations and highlight potential targets for improving therapeutic strategies in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

3. sity, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada, LUMC, Leiden, Netherlands, Heinrich

**Background and aims:**
The time of day at which exercise is performed has been shown to impact glucose homeostasis, but underlying mecha- nisms are unknown. We previously reported that 24h rhythmicity of substrate metabolism is blunted in older individuals at risk of devel- oping type 2 diabetes compared to young healthy lean individuals. Particularly, individuals at risk of developing type 2 diabetes displayed higher nocturnal respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and lack the switch to fat oxidation during the night. Here, we investigated whether an acute bout of high-intensity exercise performed either in the morning or afternoon has a differential effect on 24h rhythmicity in substrate metabolism.

**Materials and methods:**
Four females and 10 males (40-75 years, BMI >25 kg/m ) at risk of developing type 2 diabetes participated in this randomized crossover study, which consisted of three separate 24h stays in a respiration chamber to measure energy and substrate metabolism: 1) control (no exercise), 2) AM (exercise at 09:00) and 3) PM (exercise at 17:00) with a wash-out period of at least 4 weeks between each stay. Exercise sessions were done on a cycle ergometer and consisted of repeated bouts of 2 minutes at 80% of Wmax and 2 minutes at 50% of Wmax. Meals were standardized three days before and the day of the 24h stays. Blood draws were taken around the clock and continuous glucose monitors were used to determine 24h glucose profiles.

**Results:**
Directly after exercise (measured across a 3.5-hour timespan), RER was significantly lower (p<0.05) and fat oxidation significantly higher (p<0.05) in both AM and PM when compared to no exercise; underscoring the ability of the high intensity exercise to stimulate fat oxidation post-exercise. Energy expenditure was significantly higher directly after AM exercise (p<0.05), but not after PM exercise, com- pared to no exercise. Nocturnal RER was significantly lower after PM exercise, compared to AM exercise (p<0.05). Accordingly, nocturnal fat oxidation was significantly higher after PM exercise, compared to AM exercise (p<0.05). Additional data, including indirect calorimetry data during exercise, plasma metabolite levels and interstitial glucose levels, will be presented at the conference.

**Conclusion:**
Exercise performed in the afternoon lowers RER and stimulates fat oxidation during the night compared to exercise per- formed in the morning. Afternoon exercise might therefore have ben- eficial effects on 24h substrate rhythmicity in individuals at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
QWINT-1 evaluated novel fixed-dose titration of weekly efsitora (n=397) vs daily glargine U100 (n=398) in insulin naïve adults with T2D. We report patient-reported outcomes to assess patient perspectives and satisfaction.

**Materials and methods:**
The TRIM-D assessed treatment burden, daily life, diabetes management, compliance, and psychological health, plus total score. The DTSQc assessed change in treatment satisfaction; SIM-Q evaluated complexity; BIE assessed likelihood of incorporating a study insulin into a participant’s treatment routine.

**Results:**
At week 52, improvements in all TRIM-D scores occurred in both arms; burden score improved to a significantly greater extent with efsitora vs glargine (Figure). DTSQc satisfaction was modestly but sig- nificantly greater with efsitora vs glargine (mean 15.1 vs 14.5; p=0.029). On SIM-Q, a similar proportion of participants using efsitora (54%) and glargine (49%) rated weekly insulin treatment as “very simple”. On BIE, more participants were “very likely” to incorporate efsitora into their routine (63%) vs glargine (50%; p=0.005).

**Conclusion:**
In insulin naïve adults with T2D, efsitora improved health outcomes across a variety of domains and reduced treatment burden. More participants receiving efsitora vs glargine indicated that they were “very likely” to use their study treatment.

**Background and aims:**
The 78-week QWINT-3 trial assessed once- weekly efsitora (n=655) vs once-daily degludec (n=331) in adults with T2D currently on basal insulin. Here, we report the patient reported out- comes (PRO) findings at week 26 (primary timepoint).

**Materials and methods:**
TRIM-D assessed 5 domains at baseline and week 26: treatment burden, daily life, diabetes management, compliance and psychological health, including total score. Higher scores indicate a better health state. The DTSQc assessed treatment (tx) satisfaction; SIM-Q evaluated tx complexity; BIE assessed the likelihood of incorpo- rating a study insulin into a participant’s tx routine.

**Results:**
All 5 TRIM-D domains had improved scores with greater improvement for efsitora vs degludec at week 26 (Figure). More partici- pants rated efsitora as “very simple” (46%) vs degludec (35%) (p<0.001) on SIM-Q, and “very likely” to incorporate it into their tx routine (efsitora 62% vs degludec 43%; p<0.001) on BIE. DTSQc indicated greater satis- faction score with efsitora (14.9) vs degludec (12.3) (p<.001).

**Conclusion:**
Treatment with weekly efsitora resulted in greater tx satis- faction, better overall health state, and reduced tx burden vs degludec in adults with T2D currently treated with basal insulin. Greater satisfaction and perceived improved overall health state may improve adherence and clinical outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
The 52-week QWINT-2 phase 3 trial dem- onstrated non-inferiority in HbA1c change from baseline with low, comparable hypoglycemia rates for efsitora, a novel once-weekly basal insulin (N=466), vs degludec (N=462) in insulin-naïve adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we report the patient-reported outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
The TRIM-D assessed 5 domains: treat- ment burden, daily life, diabetes management, compliance, and psy- chological health, plus a total score indicating overall health. The SIM-Q evaluated treatment complexity, and the BIE assessed likeli- hood of a participant incorporating study insulin into their routine.

**Results:**
At week 52, there were significantly greater improvements in TRIM-D total score and in diabetes management and treatment burden domains with efsitora vs degludec (Figure). On the SIM-Q and BIE, more participants rated efsitora as “very simple” (51%) vs degludec (34%; <0.001) and “very likely” to incorporate into their treatment routine (50%) vs degludec (38%; =0.003), respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Weekly efsitora treatment resulted in a better overall health state, easier management, and reduced treatment burden vs daily degludec in insulin-naïve adults with T2D, with a greater sim- plicity perception by the participants. These findings may reduce insulin initiation inertia and delays in T2D management.

6. bourne, Australia, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.

**Background and aims:**
The BANDIT trial recently reported the pri- mary outcome, showing that 48 weeks of baricitinib treatment pre- served residual beta cell function in people aged 10 to 30 years with recent-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D). Meal-stimulated C-peptide was preserved in the baricitinib-treated group at the end of the treatment period at 48 weeks (primary endpoint), with lower insulin require- ments and improved glucose control measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) (secondary endpoints). Here we present findings from additional secondary and tertiary endpoints, including C-peptide, insulin use and CGM metrics during the off-drug follow-up period.

**Materials and methods:**
Participants (n=91) within 100 days of T1D diagnosis, with residual c-peptide, and positive for at least one islet autoantibody were assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, baricitinib 4mg per day or matched placebo orally for 48 weeks. Assessment visits occurred at week 0, 12, 24 and 48, and two visits during follow-up at weeks 72 and 96. Mixed-meal-stimulated mean area under the curve C-peptide levels are reported as median in nmol/liter/minute with interquartile ranges (IQR).

**Results:**
At 48 weeks the C-peptide level was 0.65 (0.31 to 0.82) in the baricitinib group and 0.43 (0.13 to 0.63) in the placebo group (p=0.001). After cessation of treatment, c-peptide levels decreased to 0.49 (0.23-0.79) in the baricitinib group and 0.36 (0.12-0.60) in the placebo group (p=0.015) at 72 weeks, and at 96 weeks to 0.37 (0.14- 0.61) for baricitinib and 0.26 (0.12-0.43) for placebo (p=0.336).The fall in C-peptide in the baricitinib group during the off-drug follow-up was associated with increased insulin requirements to maintain HbA1c resulting in no significant differences in these measures between treat- ment groups at weeks 72 and 96. Loss of treatment effect following study drug cessation was reflected in deterioration of CGM measures. The differences in time in the range 3.9-10mmol/l (TIR), time above 10mmol/L (TAR) and glucose variability (CV) that were seen in the first 48 weeks were not statistically significant at weeks 72 and 96. One of the responder definitions applied was quantitative response score (QRS), with treatment responders defined as QRS greater than zero. 75% of baricitinib participants vs 55% in the placebo group were responders at 48 weeks by QRS (p=0.0154). Subset analyses found no baseline characteristic, including age, HLA, BMI or autoantibody num- ber to be significantly associated with treatment response. Drug adher- ence (at least 80% of study drug taken) did not distinguish responders from non-responders There was no additional safety concerns raised in the follow-up period.

**Conclusion:**
Among the agents reported as promising to preserve beta cell function in T1D, baricitinib stands out because it is administered orally, is well tolerated, including by young children, and is clearly efficacious. The current data support our previously reported clinical trial data by showing the loss of therapeutic effect when baricitinib is ceased and justify consideration of further studies in stage 3 T1D as well as prevention in stage 2 T1D.

**Background and aims:**
Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) inverse ago- nists designed to limit brain penetration have recently been highlighted for their potential metabolic beneficial effects, but little is known about their mechanism of action. INV-347, a novel peripherally acting CB1R inverse agonist is currently under clinical investigation to treat obe- sity and related disorders. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the metabolic effects of INV-347 and to understand its mechanism of action in a diet-induced obese mouse model.

**Materials and methods:**
High fat diet (HFD; 60% fat)-fed, obese or lean, chow-fed male C57BL/6J mice at 22 weeks of age were treated with a single oral gavage of INV-347 (20 mg/kg) or vehicle (VEH), or pair-fed (VEH pair-fed). Daily measurements of body weight and food intake were performed (n=8-9 per group). Echo-MRI and metabolic cages were used to determine body composition and energy metabo- lism, respectively. Adipocyte area was quantified by H&E staining of adipose tissue sections, and gene expression was measured by qPCR using a targeted gene panel. Human adipose derived stem cells (hAD- SCs) were differentiated into mature adipocytes and treated with or without INV-347 (0.01-1μM) for one week prior to Oil red O staining to detect lipid content.

**Results:**
In HFD-fed mice, INV-347 induced 18.8% and 26.8% mean loss of body weight (p<0.05) and fat mass (p<0.05), respectively, 5 weeks after gavage when compared to VEH-treated mice. INV-347 treatment significantly reduced adipocyte area in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) by 14.28% (p<0.05) but not in subcutaneous depots. Treatment with INV-347 was associated with 92.56% food intake suppression (p<0.001) during the first 24h, followed by a gradual recovery of food consumption, reaching levels comparable to the VEH group at 12 days after administration. Pair-fed mice began to regain weight 9 days after the start of the paradigm, reaching initial body weights by week 5, whereas the INV-347-treated mice maintained weight loss throughout the study. In metabolic cage experiments, HFD-fed mice treated with INV-347 showed an increase in energy expenditure (0.010 ± 0.0002 (VEH) vs 0.012 ± 0.0005 (INV-347) kcal/h/g, p=0.06) and a decrease of respiratory exchange ratio (0.743 ± 0.005 (VEH) vs 0.703 ± 0.003 (INV-347), p<0.001) immediately after INV-347 administration com- pared to VEH, but showed no differences 3 weeks after treatment. In lean, chow-fed mice, INV-347 induced moderate body weight loss 2 weeks after INV-347 administration (7.38%, p<0.001), which was regained by week 5. Genes associated with lipolysis, such as Lipe, Mgll, Pnpla2, and Lpl, were up-regulated in VAT of HFD-fed mice treated with INV-347 treatment when compared to VEH (p<0.05). Finally, in hADSCs, INV-347 treatment reduced lipid droplet content by 22.23% (p<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
These results suggest that the weight loss actions of INV- 347 involve suppression of food intake as well as an increase in energy expenditure and may result from a preferential effect on VAT. While experiments to further assess the molecular mechanism are still needed, our study demonstrates the ability of INV-347 to greatly improve meta- bolic outcomes in obese mice.

**Materials and methods:**
883 subjects were dosed for 4 weeks (mean age 53 years, 50% males). 63 subjects received nimacimab at 0.6 mg/ kg (21), 1.2 mg/kg (21), or 2.5 mg/kg (21), and 20 received placebo. 69 subjects had Type 2 Diabetes and 14 had prediabetes. There were no dietary restrictions and were required not to make any active efforts to lose weight. Subjects were followed for 45 days after the last dose.

**Results:**
Safety and tolerability was assessed through Day 67. There were no deaths, SAEs, or TEAEs leading to discontinuation. The frequency of subjects with TEAEs was higher in the placebo group (80.0%) and the two lower nimacimab dose groups (61.9% and 81.0%) than the highest dose group (52.4%). The majority of TEAEs related to study drug were mild, classified as nervous system disorders (dizzi- ness, headache, lethargy) and GI disorders (diarrhea, dry mouth). No neuropsychiatric AEs related to the drug were reported. Median Tmax ranged from 0.5-2 hours and mean t1/2 from 18-22 days, consistent with other IgG therapeutic antibodies. Immunogenicity was assessed throughout the study. Only 2 subjects at the 1.2 mg/kg level had con- sistently elevated titers and no detectable ADA pre-dose, indicating a low overall immunogenicity rate with nimacimab. In one subject, ADA substantially affected systemic drug concentrations from Day 22 onwards, with no detectable drug by Day 36. All other subjects main- tained dose proportional drug exposure. Exploratory biomarkers were assessed but should be interpreted cautiously given the short 4 week dosing period, and the presence of Type 2 Diabetes in 83% of subjects. Starting Day 29, a dose-dependent reduction of LDL was observed in nimacimab-treated subjects. On Day 36, total lipids were decreased by a mean of 18.7mg/dL and LDL by 15.7mg/dL, in the 2.5mg/kg cohort, adjusted for placebo. A statistically significant reduction was observed in hyaluronic acid, a marker of adipose tissue fibrosis, on Day 36 and Day 67 in the 1.2 mg/kg group versus placebo (Day 36 mean reduction 60 ng/ml vs. 30 ng/ml, p=0.02; Day 67 mean reduction 50ng/ml vs. 26 ng/ml, p=0.04). A numerical decrease from baseline in ALT was seen from Day 29 onwards in subjects on nimacimab, as compared to pla- cebo. A numerical decrease from baseline was also observed in mean ELF scores on Day 67 in the 1.2 and 2.5 mg/kg treatment groups and in P3NP from Day 36 onwards. On Day 29, subjects in the combined treatment groups had a decrease in weight from baseline, that was 0.5kg greater compared to placebo without dietary advice or restriction.

**Conclusion:**
Nimacimab administered once weekly for 4 weeks at doses of 0.6, 1.2, and 2.5 mg/kg was well tolerated and demon- strated an overall favorable safety profile. Nimacimab does not cross the blood brain barrier, thus minimizing potential CNS-related side effects seen with small molecule CB1 inhibitors. Encouraging trends observed in markers of metabolism and tissue fibrosis warrant further clinical investigation of nimacimab for treatment of metabolic diseases. Nimacimab is currently being investigated in a Phase 2 trial for weight loss in subjects who are overweight or obese.

1. Verdiva Bio, London, UK, Sciwind Biosciences, Hangzhou, China.

**Background and aims:**
GLP-1 and amylin peptide hormones inde- pendently reduce food intake, delay gastric emptying, and decrease glucagon release. Combination of GLP-1 and amylin analogs promotes greater weight loss and glycemic control than either agent alone. Here we assessed the in vivo efficacy of a novel oral amylin analog (VRB- 103) in rodent models, as well as pharmacokinetics (PK) of the first oral co-formulation of GLP-1, amylin, and a proprietary permeation enhancer (T2026), showing improved oral bioavailability in cynomol- gus monkeys.

**Materials and methods:**
VRB-103 was administered via single daily subcutaneous injection either alone or in combination with VRB-101 (GLP-1 analog ecnoglutide) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to evalu- ate its efficacy in reducing body weight (BW). Separately, an oral co- formulated tablet of VRB-103, VRB-101, and T2026 was dosed daily in cynomolgus monkey for 7 days and PK samples were collected and analyzed.

**Results:**
In SD rats, VRB-103 alone decreased BW by 0.3%, 3.8% and 9%, 24 hours after a single subcutaneous injection of 5 nmol/kg, 25 nmol/kg and 125 nmol/kg, respectively, while the control group gained 4.7% in BW. Combination of 5 nmol/kg VRB-103 and 5 nmol/kg VRB- 101 induced a 7.4% BW loss in the same model, demonstrating supe- rior efficacy of the GLP-1/amylin combination. Oral PK study with a co-formulated tablet containing VRB-103, VRB-101 and T2026 was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. After once-daily dosing for 7 days, similarly high plasma exposures were achieved for VRB-103 (AUC​

**Conclusion:**
In a preclinical model, the combination of the amylin analog VRB-103 and GLP-1 analog VRB-101 demonstrated a syner- gistic effect on body weight reduction. Both VRB-103 and VRB-101 achieved high plasma exposures in cynomolgus monkeys when dosed orally from a single co-formulated tablet containing VRB-103, VRB- 101, and the oral permeation enhancer T2026, supporting continued development of the oral GLP-1/amylin combination for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

**MET-233 is a differentiated efficacious amylin analogue in preclini- cal studies, combinable with MET-097, an ultra-long acting GLP-1 receptor agonist**

J. Minnion

**Background and aims:**
MET-233 is an ultra-long acting (ULA) amylin analogue in clinical development for the treatment of chronic weight management. Analogues of amylin have demonstrated poten- tial as weight loss drugs, with monotherapy achieving body weight loss of up to ~10% with minimal adverse events in clinical studies. Combinations of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists and amylin analogues could provide even greater weight loss with an improved tolerability profile. MET-233 was developed to be coformu- lated with MET-097, an ULA fully-biased GLP-1R agonist, with com- patible solubility and pharmacokinetics (PK). Here, we profile MET- 233, comparing it to other clinical-stage amylin analogues, cagrilintide, GUB014295, and petrelintide, and present data supporting the develop- ment of MET-233 and MET-097 as a combination therapeutic.

**Materials and methods:**
Compounds were characterised in vitro via cAMP accumulation assays at human and rat calcitonin recep- tors (hCTR/rCTR) and human amylin receptor 3 (hAMYR3). In vivo characterisation was accomplished using pharmacodynamic studies in rats. The suitability of MET-233 and MET-097 for coadministration was assessed in rat PK studies and formulation evaluations exploring solubility and stability.

**Results:**
Receptor activity data show that all the amylin analogues tested have subnanomolar potencies ­(EC ) at hAMYR3 and hCTR. The solubility of MET-233 was compatible with MET-097, and cofor- mulation was achieved across a broad pH range (2.5-7.5) at therapeuti- cally relevant concentrations. The subcutaneous half-lives in male rats after repeat administration of MET-233 and MET-097 were 56.2 and 25.1 hours, respectively. In rats, MET-233 induced the largest reduc- tions in food intake and body weight in a matched-dose study (see Figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
In preclinical models, MET-233 is differentiated by its potency (efficacy at very low doses), PK durability, and combinability with MET-097, a fully-biased ULA GLP-1RA. Taken together, these properties suggest the potential for MET-233 to be combined with MET-097 as a differentiated, ULA treatment option for obesity and related diseases.

**Background and aims:**
Myostatin is considered one of the major pathogenic factors inducing diabetic muscle atrophy. Recently, it has been reported that an increase in myostatin can induce diabetic muscle atrophy. However, the relationship between myostatin and an HDAC3 inhibitor in skeletal muscle atrophy has not been well studied. Thus, this study aimed to investigate preventive effects of an HDAC3 inhibi- tor on diabetic muscle atrophy in db/db mice through inhibition of myostatin.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate effects of an HDAC3 inhibitor on diabetic muscle atrophy, db/db mice were randomly divided into three groups: a control group, a db/db group, and a db/db plus HDAC3 inhibitor group. Mice were administered the HDAC3 inhibitor for eight weeks. To evaluate effects of the HDAC3 inhibitor on myostatin, we analyzed myostatin protein and RNA levels using ELISA and RT-PCR. To explore molecular mechanisms of the HDAC3 inhibitor, several cell signaling molecules related to muscle atrophy were tested using western blotting.

**Results:**
Administration of the HDAC3 inhibitor to db/db mice allevi- ated muscle weight loss and muscle atrophy. Myostatin levels along with MuRF1 and atrogin-1 expression were significantly increased in the diabetic group (db/db mice) compared to those in the control. These increases were effectively reduced by HDAC3 inhibitor treatment. Next, we investigated intracellular signaling molecules of myostatin. p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3 levels were markedly reduced in the HDAC3 inhibitor-treated group, alongside decreases of t-SMAD2, t-SMAD3, and SMAD4 in the same group. These results suggest that the HDAC3 inhibitor can suppress myostatin-mediated SMAD signaling and its downstream effects on muscle atrophy. Additionally, the HDAC3 inhibitor can modulate myostatin signaling through FOXO, AMPK, mTOR, and AKT.

**Conclusion:**
In this study, the HDAC3 inhibitor ameliorated muscle atrophy by decreasing myostatin in db/db mice. Results of this study suggest that the HDAC3 inhibitor might serve as a basis for developing therapeutic drugs for atrophy-related muscular or metabolic diseases.

**Proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle supporting muscle growth and metabolic improvement effects by HM17321 in diet induced obesity mouse model**

H. Chon, Lee, S. Bae, I. Choi

**Background and aims:**
Anti-obesity drugs, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, effectively induce weight loss by suppressing appetite. How- ever, they also provoke significant reduction in lean body mass, includ- ing skeletal muscle, which may promote metabolic risks and rebound weight gain. To address this, HM17321, a novel CRFR2 selective and biased urocortin-2 analog (UCN2), has been developed and success- fully demonstrated fat mass reduction and simultaneous lean mass gain. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanism of HM17321 in lean mass gain through proteomic analysis using skeletal muscles with or without the drug treatment. Furthermore, we aim to identify the additional efficacy mechanism of HM17321 on the metabolic impair- ments which are frequently accompanied with obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
Proteomic analysis was performed using skeletal muscles collected from mice model with different conditions: vehicle treated normal mice, vehicle treated diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice, and HM17321 treated DIO. To retain a broad spectrum of proteins, data-independent acquisition based liquid chromatogra- phy- tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was employed. Finally, proteomic data with high coverage for mouse skeletal muscle proteome (more than 8,000 proteins) with more than 50% pathways of inter- est coverage was produced. In downstream analysis, differentially expressed proteins were identified, and pathway enrichment analyses such as over-representation analysis and protein set enrichment analysis were performed.

**Results:**
In proteomic analysis using skeletal muscle, we identified altered set of proteins involved in the key pathways supporting the effects of HM17321. Proteins related to signaling pathways that pro- mote muscle hypertrophy, but not proliferation, were upregulated in HM17321 treatment group than vehicle. In the aspect of energy metabolism, glycolysis pathways were significantly enriched while TCA cycle was significantly down-regulated with HM17321 suggest- ing excessive glucose utilization. Furthermore, amino acid catabo- lism pathway was significantly down-regulated by HM17321, imply- ing muscles’ effort to preserve protein source. These results directly explain HM17321’s effect on muscle growth by metabolic adaptation, with secondary improvement on systemic metabolism.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrated how HM17321 effectively pro- motes fat reduction while preserving and enhancing skeletal muscle mass in DIO mouse model. Proteomic analysis suggests the mechanism of action of HM17321 is mimicking physiologic changes induced by anerobic exercise, which promotes muscle growth, metabolic improve- ment, as well as weight loss. Together with these findings, HM17321 is a promising therapeutic candidate for obesity management overcoming lean mass loss problem, with the potential to mitigate metabolic risks of obese patients.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are among the most prevalent modifiable lifestyle-related diseases in adults. T2D is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, progressive insulin resist- ance, and low-grade inflammation that occurs in peripheral tissues. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist initially devel- oped to manage hyperglycemia, has been shown to not only achieve improved glycemic control but also clinically meaningful weight loss. Unfortunately, preliminary evidence suggests that this rapid weight reduction is accompanied with the loss of both fat and lean mass. These findings emphasize the need for strategies to preserve lean mass dur- ing semaglutide treatment. Exercise is a well-established, non-phar- macological intervention known to enhance lean mass while lower- ing fat mass. However, limited research exists regarding the impact of semaglutide on the ability to exercise. Therefore, this study aims to investigate how semaglutide treatment influences exercise capacity and the subsequent metabolic adaptations after an acute bout of exercise.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL/6J mice (N = 36) were placed on either a high-fat (n = 24) or control diet (n = 12) for 8 weeks before semaglutide treatment. Body composition was assessed, and mice underwent 14 days of treatment with either semaglutide (41.1 ug/kg; n = 12;) or vehicle (n = 24), with food intake and body weight measured daily. After which, body composition was assessed and mice were subdivided into either sedentary or exercise groups (n = 18 / group). Mice were familiarized with a treadmill over two days (15 min/day at 15 m/min). Maximum speed was determined by start- ing at 10 m/min for 3 min, then increasing speed by 3 m/min every 3 min until mice could no longer sustain the pace. 48 hours after the maximum speed test, exercised mice ran for 2 hours at 70% of their predetermined maximum speed. Immediately following, mice were euthanized, and tissues were collected, including serum, triceps, gas- trocnemius, tibialis anterior, liver, and adipose tissue. Serum mark- ers, including fatty acids, triglycerides, insulin, β-hydroxybutyrate, glucagon, and catecholamines, were quantified using colorimetric assays or ELISAs.

**Results:**
Mice treated with semaglutide had a 17% lower terminal body weight (p < 0.0001), decreased fat mass (p < 0.0001) and lean mass (p < 0.0001) compared to vehicle-treated mice. Semaglutide mice had reduced maximum running speeds compared to vehicle-treated when analyzed by ANCOVA with body mass as a covariate (p = 0.03). Analysis revealed a main effect of exercise, with elevated levels of serum β-hydroxybutyrate (p < 0.0001), noradrenaline (p = 0.0002), corticosterone (p < 0.0001), and reductions in liver glycogen (p < 0.0001), indicating comparable levels of exhaustive exercise across groups. Notably, an interaction was observed for serum fatty acids (p < 0.0001) and adrenaline (p = 0.0336), both of which increased with exercise in the vehicle and chow-fed groups. However, this response was blunted in semaglutide-treated mice, suggesting that semaglutide may suppress lipolysis during exercise.

**Conclusion:**
These findings indicate that semaglutide treatment impairs exercise ability, potentially through reduced lipolysis. Fur- ther research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this effect.

**Background and aims:**
Greenland has a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), largely driven by diabetogenic gene variants, including the common loss-of-function variant. Approximately 4% of the Greenlandic Inuit population are homozygous carriers (HO carri- ers), characterized by skeletal muscle insulin resistance and a 10-fold increased risk of developing T2D. While acute exercise improves glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in HO carriers, the effects of regular exercise training remain unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on glucose tolerance and to elucidate the underlying molecular mecha- nisms in skeletal muscle of HO carriers.

**Materials and methods:**
HO carriers (n=6) and individually matched non-carriers (n=6) completed a 6-week HIIT intervention (3 sessions/ week). Before and after the HIIT intervention, glucose tolerance was assessed by an extended 6-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 14-day continuous glucose monitoring. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained before and after the HIIT intervention and analyzed for molecular adaptations.

**Results:**
In both groups, HIIT increased exercise-regulated param- eters, including maximal oxygen uptake ­(VO ) as well as key mus- cle enzymes involved in glucose storage, phosphorylation, and oxida- tion. However, while non-carriers exhibited a significant increase in muscle GLUT4 protein content (p=0.0009), GLUT4 levels remained unchanged in HO carriers (p=0.3764). Additionally, HIIT lowered nighttime glucose levels in non-carriers but had no effect on glucose levels in HO carriers. As expected, the OGTT revealed higher glucose levels in HO carriers compared to non-carriers both before and after HIIT, with no effect of HIIT in either group.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that although HO carriers exhibit partially preserved adaptations to exercise training, their skeletal muscle response is incomplete, potentially limiting exercise-induced improvements in glucose homeostasis. This highlights the need for tailored exercise interventions or complementary therapies to prevent and treat T2D in this population.

**Background and aims:**
Transplantation of insulin-producing cells is a promising approach to cure type 1 diabetes (T1D); however, due to lack of organ donors, it has been challenging to make this treatment widely available. Recent advances have made it possible to generate insulin-producing cells from human embryonic stem cells (SC-β cells), offering a potentially unlimited source of insulin-producing cells for transplant therapy. While promising, current protocols for generating SC-β cells produce cells that do not match the glucose-stimulated insu- lin secretion of healthy human islets. Emerging evidence shows that macrophages play important roles in pancreatic islet function and are required for the development of functional beta-cells. Here we aimed to recapitulate the beneficial properties of macrophages in beta-cell development to produce SC-β cells that secrete insulin efficiently, sur- vive long-term after transplantation and reverses diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We co-aggregated SC-β cells engineered to express GFP under the influence of the insulin promoter (INS-GFP) during stage 6 of their differentiation with stem-cell-derived mac- rophages (SC-Macs) engineered to express mScarlet under influence of the macrophage-specific CD68 promoter (CD68-mScarlet) for 1 week at a 3% SC-Mac to SC-β cell ratio. Prior to co-aggregation, SC-Macs were left unpolarized or skewed to the M1-like or M2-like phenotypes. Co-aggregates were visualized with confocal microscopy to assess co- localization of mScarlet+ SC-Macs and GFP+ SC-β cells. SC-Mac phenotype pre- and post-aggregation was determined via flow cytom- etry, and via cytokine secretion. SC-β cell function was assessed by total GFP expression through flow cytometry, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. To determine if co-aggregates reverse diabetes in mice, we transplanted SC-β cells with and without SC-Macs into the anterior chamber of the eye of streptozotocin-treated SCID-Beige mice and assessed return to normoglycemia.

**Results:**
Co-aggregation with SC-Macs induced a shift toward the M2-like phenotype regardless of initial polarization, measured through a reduction in pro-inflammatory and increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Compared to SC-β cells alone, SC-β + SC-M2 co-aggregates had a 10-fold reduction in spheroid size, 10% increase in INS and IAPP co-expression, and a 2-fold increase in glucose stimu- lated insulin secretion. Moreover, STZ-treated mice transplanted with SC-β cells and M2-like SC-Macs normalized glycemia within 30 days and had controlled fasted/refed glucose levels during the study period.

**Conclusion:**
As M2-like macrophages can induce beta-cell prolifera- tion, these early data suggest that macrophages shift towards a pro- regenerative phenotype when co-cultured with SC-β cells, highlight- ing interesting cross-talk between both cell types that will be further investigated. Future work will investigate potential factors leading to improved SC-β cell maturation after co-aggregation with SC-Macs through single cell RNA sequencing.

2. Munich, Germany, German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD),

**Background and aims:**
Cell replacement therapy holds a great promise to cure diabetes. This approach involves generating insulin-producing β cells and transplanting them into diabetic patients. Yet, optimization of this potential therapeutic approach requires deeper understanding of endo- crine lineage formation (endocrinogenesis) in humans. For instance, the significance of a transiently existing cell population expressing gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) peptides during human pancreas has remained to be discovered. Here, we leverage in vitro differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into endocrine cells to explore the role of gastrin and Cholecystokinin (CCK) and their receptors CCKBR during human endocrinogenesis.

**Materials and methods:**
In this study, we used differentiation of iPSCs into stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets). Moreover, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate a CCKBR knockout (CCKBR-KO) iPSC line. We combined a wide range of approaches including Western blotting, qPCR analysis, FACS and confocal microscopy to explore the function of gastrin, CCK and their receptor during human endocrinogenesis.

**Results:**
Our analysis unveiled the emergence of gastrin- and CCK- expressing cells at the endocrine progenitor stage, with their numbers increasing during the endocrine cell stage. Notably, we observed a peak in CCKBR expression at the definitive endoderm (DE) stage. Our pharmacological analysis employing CCKBR agonists and antagonists revealed the pivotal role of CCKBR activation in promoting DE forma- tion. Importantly, deletion of CCKBR resulted in a drastic reduction in DE formation that consequently preventing endocrine lineage forma- tion. Furthermore, administration of gastrin and CCK at pancreatic progenitor stage resulted in reduced NEUROG3-expressing endocrine progenitors and increased proliferation of exocrine cells.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings identify key roles for CCKBR, gastrin, and CCK in pancreatic development. We observe that CCKBR is present during the definitive endoderm (DE) stage in the absence of gastrin and CCK, suggesting a ligand-independent function of CCKBR that is essential for DE formation. Additionally, treatment with gastrin and CCK resulted in reduced endocrinogenesis. Overall, our results empha- size the complex interplay between gastrin, CCK, and their receptor, indicating a biphasic effect on pancreatic development.

**Background and aims:**
We recently identified the role of Regulatory Factor X 6 (RFX6) in human islet development, revealing how biallelic mutations in RFX6 contribute to monogenic diabetes and hypoplas- tic pancreas formation. However, the role of RFX3 in pancreatic islet development remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated RFX3 function using iPSC-derived islet organoids.

**Materials and methods:**
RFX3 knockout (KO) iPSCs were generated via CRISPR/Cas9 and differentiated into pancreatic islet organoids. Gene expression, cell markers, apoptosis, proliferation, and function were evaluated. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing were performed to examine RFX3 expression and transcriptomic changes, with RFX3 overexpression used to reverse dysregulated gene expression.

**Results:**
RFX3 was highly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cell populations at various stages, including pancreatic progenitors (PPs), endocrine progenitors (EPs), and mature islets derived from hESCs and iPSCs. scRNA-seq further confirmed expression across different endocrine cell clusters during differentiation. Loss of RFX3 disrupted pancreatic endocrine gene regulation, reduced islet cells, and impaired beta-cell function and insulin secretion. Despite a significant reduction in all pancreatic islet hormones, the pan-endocrine marker CHGA remained unchanged, due to an increase in enterochromaffin cells (ECs), which are also known to express CHGA. This was further supported by elevated expression of EC markers, including SLC18A1, FEV, CDX2, and LMX1A, in KO EPs and islets, suggesting a shift in cell lineage commitment. Furthermore, RFX3 loss resulted in smaller islet organoids, and increased apoptosis, associated with elevated levels of the pro-apoptotic gene TXNIP in EPs and islets.Res- toration of RFX3 expression in KO pancreatic cells rescued the dysreg- ulated expression of endocrine genes and corrected the defective phe- notypes, underscoring its critical role in pancreatic islet development.

**Conclusion:**
Our study highlights RFX3 as a key regulator of human pancreatic islet cell differentiation and a suppressor of EC lineage specification, which is linked to beta cell immaturity. These findings highlight RFX3’s role in islet biology and diabetes, with potential to improve islet cell differentiation for diabetes therapies.

**Background and aims:**
Deeper insights into human pancreatic development have the potential to improve our understanding of beta cell formation, to enhance stem cell to beta cell differentiation protocols, and to inform efforts to regenerate pancreatic beta cells . Advances in spatial transcriptomic (STseq) technology have provided new insights into the developing human pancreas from 12+ weeks post-conception (PCW), although have not achieved cell-level resolution. In this present study we apply transcriptome-wide, cell- level-resolution STseq to the developing human pancreas at 8PCW, a timepoint characterised by high endocrine progenitor activity and early beta cell formation.

**Materials and methods:**
Through the MRC/Wellcome Trust Human Developmental Biology Resource (project 200730) we obtained 8PCW human embryonic pancreatic tissue from 6 donors. Immunofluores- cent (IF) staining for NKX6-1 and insulin identified intact embryonic pancreatic sections. STseq of two pancreata using the 10x Genomics Visium HD workflow enabled analysis of > 31,000 8 μm bins per tissue using 10X Loupe Browser and visualisation of transcriptomic clusters.

**Results:**
STseq was completed at a sequencing depth of 71,224 reads/ mm for sample 1 and 44,205 reads/mm for sample 2. This resulted in >12,960 genes detected per sample. Unsupervised clustering of the data revealed a cluster with highly upregulated expression of pancre- atic endocrine markers , , and and the endocrine progenitor marker ( in all cases). This aligned with INS+ regions of IF imaging of adjacent sections. A second cluster with upregulated expression ( ) was identified, but with lower expression ( ), suggesting endocrine progenitor status. The anatomical spatial map revealed the endocrine dominant cluster being surrounded by the potential progenitor mantle cluster in the spine of 8PCW pancreas. Further anatomically distinct clusters were associated with non-endocrine pancreatic tissue (NKX6-1+ but negligi- ble endocrine marker expression), nervous system (DBH, PRPH, GAL and GAP43), endothelium (VWF), vascular smooth muscle (MYH11, TAGLN and ADIRF), immune (LYZ, S100A9 and LTB) and extracel- lular matrix (COL16A1, LUM and POSTN), in all cases.

**Conclusion:**
These data provide unprecedented anatomical resolution of the embryonic pancreas transcriptome at a critical time point for beta cell neogenesis, along with insights into tissue architecture relating to regions of endocrine cell differentiation, progenitor status and other cell types.

**The relationship between sleep duration and quality and glycaemic variability in adults with type 1 diabetes**

A. Duda-Sobczak, Zozulinska-Ziolkiewicz

**Background and aims:**
National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recom- mends 7-9 hours of daily sleep for young adults (18-25 years) and adults (26-64 years). Inadequate duration and sleep quality may nega- tively impact the outcomes of diabetes treatment. This study aimed to assess if sleep duration and quality are associated with glycaemic variability parameters in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

**Materials and methods:**
155 participants with T1D (73 men, 47%), aged 33±9 years, diabetes duration 12 (IQR 8-20) years, HbA1c 7.4±1.0%, were included in 2023-2024. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a self-report questionnaire assessing sleep dura- tion and quality during the preceding month. Continuous glucose moni- toring (CGM) data, registered simultaneously, were downloaded and analyzed for all participants using Glyculator 3.0. Statistical analysis was performed using Dell Statistica v.13. The Kruskal-Wallis test with post-hoc Bonferroni correction and multiple logistic regression were used. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
78 participants (50.3%) met the NSF criteria of recommended sleep duration (target: T), 56 (36.1%) declared sleeping less (L) than 7h, 21 (13.6%) sleeping more (M) than 9h. Compared with partici- pants sleeping 7-9h daily, each other group - sleeping less or more had higher mean glucose (T:161±29 vs. L:172±28 vs. M:175±34mg/dl, p=0.035), higher coefficient of glycaemic variability (CV) (T:35.6±6.3 vs. L:38.6±5.7 vs. M:38.8±6.0, p=0.024), higher glycemia risk index (GRI) (T:43.2±20 vs. L:51.6±20 vs. M:53.6±21, p=0.022), higher high blood glucose index (HBGI) (T:6.9 [IQR 4.6-9.4] vs. L:9.5 [IQR 5.3-13.2] vs. M:9.8 [IQR 5.6-11.9], p=0.023), higher mean ampli- tude of glucose excursions (MAGE) (T:108.0±27 vs. L:127.8±33 vs. M:126.8±28,, p=0.001), higher glycaemic risk assessment in diabetes equation (GRADE) (T:8.4 [IQR 6.6-10.3] vs. L:10.3 [IQR 7.1-12.6] vs. M:10.3 [IQR 7.3-12], p=0.026), higher mean of daily differences (MODD) (T:57.6±14 vs. L:68.0±17 vs M:69.3±18, p=0.0017) and lower time-in-range (TIR) (T:63.5±16 vs. L:57.7±15 vs. M:56.1±16%, p=0.037). No differences in sleep quality, low blood glucose index (LBGI), HbA1c, or diabetes duration were shown between groups. In multivariable logistic regression analysis sleeping 7-9h daily was associated with lower values of glucose variability parameters, com- pared with sleeping less or more (combined groups not meeting NSF criteria): CV (OR 0.92 [95%CI, 0.86-0.97], p=0.004), MAGE (OR 0.97 [95%CI, 0.96-0.99], p=0.0005), and MODD (OR 0.95 [95%CI, 0.92-0.97], p=0.005), after adjustment for age, gender and HbA1c.

**Conclusion:**
Adults with T1D declaring NSF-recommended 7-9 hours of sleep per day presented lower glycaemic variability than those declaring shorter or longer sleep duration.

**Sleep and glycaemic patterns in hyperglycaemic pregnancies: evi- dence from continuous glucose monitoring**

S. Rawal

**Background and aims:**
Sleep disturbances are common during preg- nancy and may adversely affect glucose metabolism. Although sleep duration and quality have been associated with the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), few studies have investigated their relationship with glycemic control in pregnancies already complicated by hyperglycemia. This study aims to examine the associations between subjective sleep duration and quality and continuous glucose monitor- ing (CGM)-derived glucose metrics in pregnant women with GDM or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 48 pregnant women with GDM or IGT (26 from New Jersey, USA and 22 from Dhulikhel, Nepal) were enrolled in the study between 24-35 weeks of gestation. At enrollment, participants self-reported their sleep duration and quality over the past month using two items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep duration was reported as the average number of hours slept per night, while sleep quality was rated on a four- point scale ranging from “very good” to “very bad.” Following this assessment, participants wore a FreeStyle Libre CGM sensor for up to 14 days. Multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for maternal age, gestational age at enrollment, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, and moderate-vigorous physi- cal activity (MVPA; minutes per week), were used to examine associa- tions between sleep parameters and CGM-derived metrics, including 24-hour, daytime, and nocturnal mean glucose, glucose variability, fasting glucose, and time in range (TIR).

**Results:**
Sleep quality was not significantly associated with any glyce- mic outcomes. In contrast, longer sleep duration was generally associ- ated with more favorable glucose profiles across multiple CGM met- rics. Compared to those sleeping ≤6 hours, participants who slept 6.1 to 7.9 hours had lower 24-hour, daytime, nocturnal, and fasting glucose levels, while those sleeping 8.0 to 8.9 hours also exhibited lower fast- ing glucose over the subsequent 14 days. However, these associations were modest and did not reach statistical significance overall. When stratified by country, significant associations were observed in the U.S. sample. Sleeping 6.1-7.9 hours ( vs. ≤6 hours) was associated with significantly lower 24-hour mean glucose (β = -26.6, 95% CI: -43.3 to -9.8; p = 0.004), daytime mean glucose (β = -27.9, 95% CI: -46.7 to -9.0; p = 0.006), nocturnal mean glucose (β = -22.6, 95% CI: -35.3 to -9.8; p = 0.002), and fasting glucose (β = -23.1, 95% CI: -38.4 to -7.9; p = 0.005). While sleep duration of 9+ hours were also associated with lower glucose levels across these metrics, the associations were only marginally significant. Notably, sleeping 8.0 to 8.9 hours was associ- ated with significantly lower fasting glucose (β = -15.2, 95% CI: -29.9 to -0.4, p = 0.04) compared to ≤6 hours.

**Conclusion:**
Longer sleep duration was generally associated with improved glycemic profiles in pregnant women with GDM or IGT, particularly among participants in the U.S. sample. The lack of consist- ent associations in the Nepal subgroup may reflect contextual factors such as lifestyle, healthcare access, and variability in GDM phenotypes related to racial and ethnic differences. Further research is needed to confirm these associations across diverse populations.

**Background and aims:**
Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) plays a central role in modern diabetes management in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, sensor performance is restricted during glucose fluctuations, like during physical activity and exercise. To ensure adequate comparisons of rtCGM systems, head-to-head stud- ies that include physical activity and exercise are required. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyze the performance of three different rtCGM systems in parallel use when physical activity and exercise are performed in a lab setting followed by a home phase in people with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Twenty adults with T1D (9 females; age 50±12 years; HbA1c 6.6±0.5%) took part in this study, which included a three-day in-lab phase where three group exercise sessions (each lasting 90 minutes) took place, followed by a four-day home phase. For the study period, participants wore a Dexcom G7 (Dex- com), FreeStyle Libre 3 (Abbott) and Simplera rtCGM (Medtronic) system. From 8:00 am (first measurement) to 10:00 pm (last meas- urement), blood glucose measurements (in double) were taken two- hourly with the Contour Next One glucometer (Ascensia Diabetes Care) and were documented in addition to the actual sensor glucose values. During the home phase, four measurement time points were conducted: before breakfast, before lunch, before dinner and two hours after dinner. Accuracy of the rtCGM systems were evaluated by means of median absolute relative difference (MedARD) and interquartile range [IQR] against the reference blood glucose meter. Absolute relative differences (|ARD|) of the three rtCGMs were ana- lyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test (p<0.05).

**Results:**
Overall, a total of 724 comparison values were available for Dexcom G7, 724 for FreeStyle Libre 3 and 720 for the Simplera rtCGM system. The overall MedARD [IQR] for Dexcom G7 was 8.4% [3.6- 14.0], for FreeStyle Libre 3 7.5% [3.1-13.4] and for Simplera 13.8% [6.9-22.6]. For the in-lab phase, a total of 418 comparison values were available for Dexcom G7, 410 for FreeStyle Libre 3 and 413 for the Simplera rtCGM system. The MedARD [IQR] for Dexcom G7 was 8.7% [3.7-14.5], for FreeStyle Libre 3 8.0% [3.6-14.2] and for Simplera 15.1% [7.4-26.0]. For the home phase, 306 comparison values were available for Dexcom G7, 313 for FreeStyle Libre 3 and 306 for the Simplera rtCGM system. The MedARD [IQR] for Dexcom G7 was 7.9% [3.7-13.7], for FreeStyle Libre 3 6.8% [2.7-12.5] and for Simplera 12.4% [6.3-20.2]. When comparing the absolute relative differences (|ARD|), no significant differences were found between FreeStyle Libre 3 vs. Dexcom G7 including all phases (overall: p=0.35, in-lab: p>0.99, home phase: p=0.18). When comparing Dexcom G7 vs. Simplera and FreeStyle Libre 3 vs. Simplera, a significant difference was found for all phases (all p<0.01).

**Conclusion:**
In this head-to-head comparison, the Dexcom G7 and the Freestyle Libre 3 rtCGM system showed very high accuracy when compared against reference blood glucose; the lower accuracy observed with the Simplera sensor might increase the need for confirmatory blood glucose measurements during physical activity and exercise.

**Glucoselo: causal modelling approach using matched-pair analy- sis to evaluate physical activity as a real-world glucose-lowering strategy in type 1 diabetes**

**Background and aims:**
High glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) are typically managed with insulin. However, insulin acts slowly, which can lead to delayed correction or insulin stacking. Physical activity (PA) provides an alternative approach, lowering glu- cose both by enhancing insulin sensitivity and through insulin-inde- pendent mechanisms. Despite its potential, evidence for PA’s glucose- lowering effect mostly comes from non-controlled studies. Causal modelling offers a way to estimate intervention effects (e.g., PA) in observational data by approximating the conditions of a randomised controlled trial. To address the lack of causal evidence in free-living settings, we used a within-subject matched-pair design to estimate the glucose-lowering effect of brief PA bouts initiated when glucose levels exceeded 10.0 mmol/L.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed CGM data from 516 partici- pants in the T1DEXI and T1DEXIP studies, identifying 1,678 matched pairs of PA and non-activity episodes (10-30 minutes each) from within the same individual. Matching was performed using a novel, outcome- informed k-nearest neighbours algorithm, weighted by the covariates most predictive of glucose change: starting glucose, glucose rate of change (ROC), insulin on board (IOB), and short-term pre-activity glucose variability. This within-person matching design controls for demographic characteristics and approximates what would have hap- pened to glucose had PA not occurred. Glucose change for PA was compared to matched non-activity periods using mixed-effects models.

**Results:**
Matched-pair analysis showed that PA resulted in a mean glucose reduction of −2.2 mmol/L (95% CI: −2.4 to −2.1), compared to −0.3 mmol/L (95% CI: −0.4 to −0.2) during matched non-activity periods. This yielded a causal estimate of −1.9 mmol/L (95% CI: −2.0 to −1.7) directly attributable to PA. The glucose-lowering effect var- ied significantly based on key predictors, particularly the starting rate of change (ROC) and starting glucose level (both p < 0.001; Fig. 1). Additional moderating factors included glucose variability, PA dura- tion, and insulin on board (IOB) (all p < 0.05). Hypoglycaemia (<3.9 mmol/L) occurred in 1.8% of PA events, compared to 0.2% of matched non-activity events.

**Conclusion:**
Using a novel causal modelling approach, this study dem- onstrates that short bouts of PA substantially lower glucose levels in people with T1D when starting glucose is above 10.0 mmol/L. Match- ing on outcome-relevant covariates allows for robust estimation of causal effects and visualisations that allow for personalised education

2. China, Kailuan Hospital, North China University of Science and

**Background and aims:**
Patients with diabetes mellitus and comor- bid hypertension are at high risk of all-cause mortality. This study aimed to characterize the complex relationships of renal function and triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) with 5-year all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes-hypertension comorbidity.

**Materials and methods:**
Overall, 6,735 patients from the 1999-2014 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles and 4,316 from the 2010-2015 China Kailuan cycles were included. TyG was calculated as the logarithmic product of the fasting triglyceride and glucose concentrations. Renal function was defined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

**Results:**
The prevalence of 5-year all-cause mortality was 8.6% in the NHANES population and 9.1% in the Kailuan cohort. Both the TyG and eGFR level were significantly associated with 5-year all-cause mortality. eGFR mediated the association between TyG and all-cause mortality, being responsible for 29.8% in the NHANES database and 34.1% in the Kailuan cohort. Significant multiplicative effects were identified between eGFR and TyG in both two cohorts. Compared with people with a lower TyG (median level, 9.4 for the NHANES database and 9.7 for the Kailuan cohort) and eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 ­m , those with a higher TyG index and decreased eGFR had the highest risk of all-cause mortality (HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.61-3.58 for the NHANES database; HR 2.89, 95% CI 1.95-4.02 for the Kailuan cohort).

**Conclusion:**
eGFR mediated a considerable proportion of the effect of TyG on all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes and hypertension. The combination of a higher TyG index and lower eGFR level was associated with the highest risk of all-cause mortality.

**Background and aims:**
Arterial stiffening is associated with vascular ageing and occurs early in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the mechanisms and risk factors unique to this process remain poorly understood. We therefore aimed to assess the heritability of arterial stiffness and identify any associated genetic variants in the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of arterial stiffness in individuals with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Genotyping of individuals in the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study was performed using HumanCoreExome BeadChips, and the Finnish SISu v3 reference was used for imputa- tion. We estimated the heritability of peripheral pulse pressure (PPP) with GCTA sofware and performed both sex-specific and sex-combined GWASs of five arterial stiffness measures with Rvtests software. PPP (N = 5,180) was calculated using office blood pressure values from a study visit (n = 4,365) or from medical files (n = 815). For those using antihypertensive medication, PPP was adjusted by adding a constant of 5 mmHg. The four other arterial stiffness measures, assessed by applanation tonometry, were: central pulse pressure (CPP, N = 875), augmentation index (AIx, N = 862), carotid-femoral pulse wave veloc- ity (cfPWV, N = 467) and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV, N = 487). For PPP, meta-analysis with a T1D cohort from the THL Biobank (N = 902) was performed using METAL software. Replication of lead variants was sought in individuals with T1D from the AfterEU cohort (Denmark) with available PPP (N = 817) and in the general population (excluding relatives) from the UK Biobank with available PPP (N = 273,301) or arterial stiffness index (ASI, N = 99,093). The analyses were adjusted for sex, age, ­age and either genetic kinship matrix or principal components.

**Results:**
PPP had an estimated narrow-sense heritability of = 0.18 (95% CI: 0.06-0.30, = 0.001). In the GWASs, 25 variants were sug- gestively associated ( < 1 × ­10 ) with the arterial stiffness measures. Of these variants, two for PPP, two for crPWV and one for AIx repli- cated ( < 0.05) in at least one other cohort. A rare protective intronic variant in the gene (rs192498855, MAF = 0.01) reached near genome-wide significance for PPP ( = -0.54, = 5.95 × ­10 ), and replicated in the UK Biobank for ASI ( = 0.009). is involved in the deubiquitination of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α affecting angiogenesis and glucose metabolism, as well as the beta-2 adrenergic receptor with a role in vasodilatation. Another variant, rs192845209, had genome-wide significant heterogeneity between the sexes (Cochran’s -test, = 2.68 × ­10 ) in association to CPP.

**Conclusion:**
PPP as a proxy for arterial stiffness showed moderate heritability in individuals with T1D. Of the 25 discovered lead variants for PPP, CPP, AIx, cfPWV and crPWV, 5 were replicated in another cohort. The findings support the role of in arterial stiffness in diabetes, but functional studies are needed to determine the relevance of the association.

**Visit to visit blood pressure variability is an independent risk- factor for kidney disease progression and renal function loss in people with type 1 diabetes**

V. Krasniqi

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression and renal function loss is strongly determined by blood pressure (BP). It is well established that African-Caribbean heritage/ethnicity can impact on BP control in people with essential hypertension or type 2 diabetes. More recently visit-to-visit blood pressure variability (BPV) has been implicated as a potential factor for kidney disease progression in people with type 2 diabetes. However the role or impact of BPV in accelerating DKD progression in people with type 1 diabetes from ethnically diverse populations is unknown. Our aim was to study role of BPV on DKD progression in a cohort of ethnically diverse people with type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Electronic health records including out- patient clinic BP measures from 3533 individuals with type 1 diabetes attending two large university hospitals from 2004 to 2018 were ana- lysed. BPV was assessed using distinct four methods which included standard deviation (SD), visit adjusted SD, average real variability (ARV), and variation independent of mean (VIM). These metrics were calculated for Systolic BP (SBP), Diastolic BP (DBP), Pulse Pressure (PP) and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) measurements. Multivariate regression models were used to determine whether there was a signifi- cant association between BPV and primary endpoint of DKD progres- sion which was defined as eGFR fall >50% from baseline with final eGFR <30 ml/min

**Results:**
The study cohort included 3533 people (50% female, mean age 38 years) of whom 12% were African Caribbean heritage. Of the cohort 6.1% reached primary endpoint (214 people). BPV metrics for SBP, MAP and PP were significantly associated with the primary endpoint independent of traditional risk factors including baseline BP, HBA1c, eGFR and albuminuria[. The strongest association was observed for ARV of SBP (Hazard ratio (HR):2.25, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):1.52-3.32, p<0.001). In our analyses African Caribbean heritage remained significantly associated with the primary endpoint (HR:1.65, 95% CI:1.18-2.30, p=0.003) independent of BPV metrics.

**Conclusion:**
In a cohort of ethnically diverse people with type 1 dia- betes SBP, PP and MAP BPV metrics were associated with DKD pro- gression. The impact African Caribbean heritage on DKD progression remained significantly associated and was not influenced by BPV. Fur- ther studies are needed to establish if reducing BPV directly impacts on reducing DKD progression, as this will inform the potential value of BPV as a modifiable risk factor for preventing progression of DKD.

**Background and aims:**
Understanding what accelerates the progres- sion in chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type-2 diabetes (T2D) will inform targeted therapies and improve patient outcomes. We had the opportunity to access 24 years of patient data from the Salford Care Record.

**Materials and methods:**
A prospective study examining the two main components of CKD (urine albumin/creatinine ratio (uACR) and esti- mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)), over 24 years (2001-2024) in a cohort of 718 individuals with T2D. Longitudinal modelling exam- ined the rate of change of uACR and eGFR over the 24 years, as well as whether sex, smoking status, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI) influenced that rate of that change in the total sample and its three sub-groups (no-CKD; CKD with increased ACR but preserved eGFR; and CKD with increased ACR and reduced eGFR).

**Results:**
At baseline in the whole cohort, 451 (62.8%) patients had no CKD (normal uACR and eGFR ≥60ml/min/1.73m ). At 24-year follow-up, 196 of these patients (43%) had progressed to a uACR >3 or eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m , developing CKD. Ten (1.4%) patients progressed to end stage kidney disease (eGFR<15ml/min/1.73m ). At our final follow-up, 282 patients had survived. For the whole cohort, uACR increased exponentially, while eGFR decreased linearly by 1.02 mL/min/1.73m per year (Figure 1). For uACR: SBP (β=0.36, 95% CI [0.24, 0.48]) and DBP (β=0.40, 95% CI [0.16-0.64]) were the only significant independent predictors of uACR progression, particularly in the sub-group with increased ACR and preserved eGFR. For eGFR: Female sex (β=-3.79, 95% CI [1.96, 5.63]), higher SBP (β=-0.12, 95% CI [-0.17, -0.06]), higher DBP (β=-0.19, 95% CI [-0.08, -0.31]), higher HbA1c (β=-1.17, 95% CI [-0.63, -1.71]), lower baseline cho- lesterol (β=0.86, 95% CI [0.29, 1.43]), and smoking (β=-2.05, 95% CI [-3.80, -1.30]) were significant independent predictors of eGFR progression, but only in the non-CKD at baseline sub-group. The % mortality at 24-year follow-up for no CKD at baseline was 219 (48.6%), for CKD with increased ACR/preserved eGFR was 158 (76.7%), and for increased ACR and reduced eGFR was 59 (96.7%).

**Conclusion:**
Female sex and current/previous smoking were associated with accelerated progression of CKD. The group with uACR > 3mg/ mmol at baseline exhibited the highest rate of uACR increase. Multiple factors influenced eGFR decrease in those with baseline eGFR ≥ 60ml/ min/1.73m . Mortality rate was profoundly influenced by historical CKD status.

2. seldorf, Germany, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,

**Background and aims:**
High-energy nutrition may sequentially pro- mote insulin resistance in different tissues. Recent rodent studies indi- cate that white adipose tissue (WAT) may play a key role in the induc- tion of whole-body insulin resistance. Thus, we hypothesized that WAT responds early to overnutrition-induced metabolic changes in humans.

**Materials and methods:**
In a randomized, parallel-group study design, young glucose-tolerant volunteers consumed either an isoenergetic diet (ID; 55% carbohydrates, 15% proteins, 30% lipids) or a high-energy high-fat diet (HFD; ID +40% of total energy requirement in lipids) for three weeks. They underwent hyperinsulinaemic−euglycaemic clamps for assessment of whole body (predominantly skeletal muscle (SkM)) insulin sensitivity as well as WAT and skeletal muscle biop- sies. High-resolution respirometry in tissues was performed to assess mitochondrial respiration ­(JO ). Fat mass index (FMI) was calculated as fat mass divided by height squared and adipose tissue insulin resist- ance (Adipo-IR) as fasting insulin times non-esterified fatty acid levels. Intramyocellular and hepatic lipid content as well as hepatic ATP- and inorganic phosphate (Pi) - levels were quantified by H/ P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

**Results:**
ID and HFD groups had comparable anthropometric features (women/men: 2/8 per group; BMI 25.9±3.4 and 25.9±2.7 kg/m ). After three weeks of intervention, body weight (mean change±SEM: HFD vs. ID: +2.0±0.8 vs. -0.6±0.5 kg, p=0.011), FMI (+0.60±0.18 vs -0.03±0.10 kg/m , p=0.007) and Adipo-IR (+1.10±0.57 vs -0.24±0.55 mmol·mU/L², p=0.026) increased with HFD, but not with ID. Also, ­JO (maximal noncoupled respiration) in WAT [+0.338±0.128 vs -0.518±0.298 pmol/(mg·s), p=0.004] rose after HFD only. In contrast, whole-body insulin sensitivity, muscle and liver lipid content as well as hepatic ATP- and inorganic phosphate (Pi)- concentrations did not change in either group (p>0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Short-term high-fat diet decreases insulin sensitivity along with increasing mitochondrial respiratory capacity primarily in white adipose tissue, without affecting skeletal muscle and liver metabolism. This suggests a predominant role of adipose tissue in the early development of overnutrition-induced insulin resistance.

**Harnessing a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation to uncover mitochondrial mechanisms driving insulin resistance in humans**

T.L. Nielsen, M. ­Andersen, M. Dunø, M. ­Murgia, S. ­Larsen, S.S. ­Torekov, J. ­Vissing, M. ­Fiorenza

**Background and aims:**
Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance; however, the direction of causality remains unclear. Individuals carrying a rare pathogenic mito- chondrial DNA mutation (m.3243A>G) exhibit insulin resistance and have a high prevalence of diabetes, representing a unique human model to investigate mitochondrial mechanisms contributing to insulin resist- ance. Herein, we employed comprehensive physiological and metabolic studies in m.3243A>G carriers to identify mitochondrial derangements driving insulin resistance in humans while elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms.

**Materials and methods:**
In a case-control study design, individu- als carrying the m.3243A>G mutation (n=15) were compared with healthy controls matched 1:1 for age, sex, and daily physical activity level (measured by wrist-worn accelerometers). Participants under- went: i) a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp combined with the femoral arteriovenous balance technique and glucose tracer infusion to assess muscle-, liver-, and adipose tissue-specific insulin sensitivity, and ii) an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to evaluate β-cell func- tion. Muscle biopsies were collected for analyses of mitochondrial con- tent, mitochondrial bioenergetic function, subcellular oxidative stress, proteomic signatures, and insulin signaling.

**Results:**
Skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, measured by the insulin- stimulated net exchange of glucose across the leg, was 45% lower in m.3243A>G carriers compared to controls (means ± 95% CI: 24.2±8.9 vs. 46.1±9.0 μmol/min/leg lean mass). Liver and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity, assessed by the insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glu- cose production and lipolysis, remained intact in m.3243A>G carriers. β-cell function, quantified using the disposition index from the OGTT, was 65% lower in m.3243A>G carriers. Muscle mitochondrial content, measured by citrate synthase activity, was reduced in m.3243A>G car- riers. Ex vivo analyses of muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics revealed reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission per unit tissue weight in m.3243A>G carriers; however, these parameters were unaltered when adjusted for mitochondrial content and respiratory rate, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
m.3243A>G carriers exhibit profound muscle insulin resistance along with reduced muscle mitochondrial content but pre- served intrinsic mitochondrial bioenergetic function. These alterations are accompanied by β-cell dysfunction, whereas liver- and adipose tissue-specific insulin sensitivity are unaffected. Ongoing analyses of plasma and muscle tissue samples will provide deeper insight into mitochondrial mechanisms driving muscle insulin resistance in this unique human model. Our findings may elucidate the role of mitochon- dria in common forms of insulin resistance and inform the development of mitochondria-targeted therapies.

**Background and aims:**
Despite evidence of insulin resistance in peo- ple with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) there are no data using the “gold standard” euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp available.

**Materials and methods:**
Insulin sensitivity (IS) measured as glucose disposal rate (GDR) from the last 30 min of clamps conducted between 2006-2023 in 189 people (63% men) with T1D (34 with DKD, 65% men) at four international centres (Finland, Poland and two in Aus- tralia) was compared in a two-stage meta-analysis. DKD diagnosis was based on broadly similar centre-specific criteria incorporating albuminuria, with minor variations in thresholds, collection methods, and use of eGFR.

**Results:**
As expected, eGFR (CKD-EPI 2021 formula) was lower in those with DKD compared to those with no DKD (weighted median (LQ, UQ) 86.4 (66.2, 106.7) vs. 107.2 (100.5, 112.0) mL/min/1.73m2 (difference: -18.61 (-35.7, -1.55) mg/min/1.73m2, p=0.03) albeit showed heterogeneity: I2 statistic=88.39, p<0.0001. HbA1c was higher (8.4±1.7 vs. 7.4±1.2%; difference: 0.8 (-0.4, 1.9)%, p=0.20, I2 statistic=86%, p<0.0001) in DKD vs. no DKD respectively, but there was no difference in age (37 (35, 55) vs. 35 (33, 38) yrs; difference 0.87 (-9.70, 11.45) yrs, p=0.87, I2 statistic=89%, p<0.0001) HDL-C was lower in DKD: 1.4±0.4 vs. 1.6±0.5 mM (difference: -0.21 (-0.37, -0.06) mM, p=0.008, I2 statistic=0%, p=0.76). Notably, IS was lower in individuals with T1D and DKD vs no DKD (GDR 4.9 (4.0, 6.2) vs. 6.4 (4.5, 6.9) mg/kg/min, difference: -1.70 (-2.87, -0.54) mg/kg/min, (p=0.004, I2 statistic=35%, p=0.23). The significance was attenuated after adjustment for age, sex, HbA1c and lipids concentrations. Mean total daily insulin dose/kg body weight was higher in those with DKD vs. no DKD: 0.60 (0.57, 0.68) vs. 0.48 (0.45, 0.58) IU/kg (difference: 0.12 (0.06, 0.20) IU/kg, p=0.0005, I2 statistic=0%, p=0.86). Estimated GDR (eGDR) calculated from 14 formulae, showed that 10 formulae had significantly lower eGDR in T1D with vs. without DKD.

**Conclusion:**
In this cross-sectional meta-analysis of 189 people with T1D undergoing euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp studies IS assessed by GDR was significantly impaired in those with vs. without DKD. Additionally, those with vs. without DKD had lower HDL-C and eGFR and were taking higher insulin doses. Most of available IS (eGDR) formulae correctly estimated the lower IS in DKD.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin resistance (IR), which precedes type 2 diabetes, can differ in location and severity between key metabolic organs such as the liver and muscle. Different IR subtypes may vary in physical characteristics and risk of developing into type 2 diabetes. Hence, we investigated differences in body fat distribution and risk of type 2 diabetes for different IR subtypes.

**Materials and methods:**
In the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study, we computed 3 indices of IR in participants without pre- existing type 2 diabetes: hepatic insulin resistance index (HIRI), muscle insulin resistance index (MIRI), and disposition index (DI, a measure of pancreatic beta cell function). The cut-off value at the unfavorable tertile for each of these indices was used to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy scores and we subsequently classified participants into 8 subtypes of IR (see table). For each subtype, we calculated differences in waist circumference, visceral- and liver fat using linear regression as well as hazard ratios (HR) of type 2 diabetes using Cox regression with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) with insulin sensitive subtype as reference. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, physical activity, diet quality, and total body fat (for type 2 diabetes).

**Results:**
We included 5509 (53% women) participants, with a mean (SD) age of 54 (6) years, and BMI of 30 (5) kg/m . During a median follow-up of 6.6 years, 283 participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Risk of type 2 diabetes differed strongly between IR subtypes and was increased in all subtypes with low DI, most notably in those with ‘low DI + hepatic IR’ (HR=19.48 [9.02-42.09]) and ‘low DI + hepatic IR + muscle IR’ (HR=20.16 [9.32-43.60]) (see table). All hepatic IR subtypes were associated with greater adiposity and largest waist, and largest amount of visceral- and liver fat was observed in those with the ‘low DI + hepatic + muscle IR’ subtype.

**Conclusion:**
Risk of type 2 diabetes differs strongly between IR sub- types and consideration of DI may help to detect patients at high risk of type 2 diabetes.

**Exome-wide analysis identifies risk alleles associated with dementia in type 2 diabetes**

T. Wu

**Background and aims:**
Dementia, a critical complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D), presents significant challenges due to its poor prog- nosis. Given the substantial genetic contribution to diabetic complica- tions, elucidating the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes-associated dementia would advance understanding of its mechanism and enable genetic risk stratification. This study aims to identify risk alleles linked to dementia in type 2 diabetes and to develop genetic assessment tools to identify patients with high genetic risks of dementia.

**Materials and methods:**
We included 39,379 UK Biobank partici- pants with T2D and complete covariate data, excluding those with low sequencing quality and high kinship coefficients. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted to reveal risk alleles of all-cause dementia (ACD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) in the T2D population. After gene prioritization, gene and gene- set analyses were performed to explore underlying mechanisms. A polygenic score (PRS) for ACD was subsequently developed for clini- cal application.

**Results:**
Among all participants with T2D (mean follow-up 9.03 years), 1,380 participants developed dementia, including 529 AD and 450 VD cases. GWAS identified nine ACD-associated loci, six near on chromosome 19 and others on chromosomes 1, 12 and 14 (Benjamini- Hochberg adjusted < 0.05). Single-variant tests revealed six AD and five VD risk alleles on chromosome 19, highlighting ’s role in AD and VD development. LD score regression revealed negligible genomic inflation effects in all tests (λ ACD = 1.02, AD = 0.93, VD = 0.94) and moderate heritability in dementia associated with type 2 diabetes ( : ACD=0.04, AD=7*10 , VD=0.03). Gene prior- itization linked ACD risk alleles to amino acid metabolic pathways, with hippocampal enrichment. AD and VD genes were implicated in carbohydrate metabolism including pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis, with AD-associated genes notably localized in the basal ganglia. Further, to facilitate genetic risk stratification, we generated a polygenic risk score to facilitate risk stratification, which exhibited an AUC of 0.59 (0.58-0.60). The Cox hazard proportional model revealed a significantly elevated risk of developing dementia in patients with higher polygenic scores (HR=1.97, 95% CI 1.75-2.21, <0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings advance the genetic understanding of T2D- associated dementia and provide mechanistic insights. The developed PRS offers a tool for identifying T2D patients at high genetic risk for dementia, supporting early screening strategies.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is known to be a modifiable risk fac- tor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. However, the impact of overweight and obesity on brain aging and AD-related atrophy, particularly in cognitively unimpaired individuals, remains unclear.

**Materials and methods:**
Participant data were drawn from the iSTAG- ING consortium, including T1-weighted brain MRI scans from 46,288 participants without diagnosed cognitive impairment in 15 studies (mean age: 64.33 ± 8.13 years; 54% women, mean BMI: 26.81 +- 4.49 kg/m ). We derived machine learning metrics of brain age and AD-signature region atrophy, termed Spatial Pattern of Abnormal- ity for Recognition of Early (SPARE) indices. Initially, we employed generalised linear models to analyse each machine learning index (SPARE-BA or SPARE-AD), with BMI group, age, sex, intracranial volume, and interaction terms for BMI group × age, and BMI group × sex as predictors. We performed post-hoc comparisons between sex groups and BMI categories, adjusting value by Tukey’s test using the “emmeans” package in R.

**Results:**
Obesity was significantly associated with increased brain age- ing compared to normal weight (β = 11.20; SE = 1.13; ­p < 0.001) (Fig 1a) and overweight groups (β = 8.17; SE = 1.11; ­p < 0.001), with a stronger effect in males. Overweight males also showed higher brain ageing values than normal weight individuals (β = 3.04; SE = 0.927; ­p = 0.003) (Fig 1a). Regarding brain atrophy, males with obe- sity displayed higher brain atrophy than normal weight males (β = -0.02; SE = 0.007; ­p = 0.041) (Fig 1b), but normal weight females showed higher brain atrophy than overweight females (β = 0.02; SE = 0.005; ­p = 0.002) (Fig 1b). Sex differences within the same BMI categories were observed, with males exhibiting increased brain aging in obese (β = 12.08; SE = 1.94; ­p < 0.001) and overweight groups (β = 3.15; SE = 1.44; ­p = 0.029) and higher brain atrophy in the overweight group than females (β = -0.01; SE = 0.006; ­p = 0.045), while females displayed increased brain aging and brain atrophy in the normal weight group relative to males (Brain Aging: β = 8.29; SE = 1.51; ­p < 0.001, Brain Atrophy: β = 0.02; SE = 0.006; ­p = 0.009).

**Conclusion:**
The findings demonstrate that higher BMI states are asso- ciated with accelerated brain ageing and atrophy particularly in males, while normal-weight females demonstrated higher brain ageing and atrophy than normal-weight men.

**Background and aims:**
The landscape of diabetes-related complica- tions continues to evolve, and we are now witnessing the emergence of ’non-traditional’ complications of diabetes such as dementia, cancer and liver disease. A rise in diabetes-associated mortality from dementia is reported by a few high-income countries where dementia mortality is higher among people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. While this is true in general, there is a paucity of data on whether this diabetes-associated differential dementia mortality varies by age and sex. Further, long-term trends of excess mortality from dementia (in people with vs. without diabetes) are inadequately described, necessi- tating further research to understand the global trends better. Therefore, the present analysis was conducted to estimate age- and sex-specific trends in mortality from dementia in people with and without diabetes using multi-country, whole-of-population data.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed aggregated mortality data from registries and administrative sources across seven jurisdictions (Aus- tralia, Denmark, Finland, France, Scotland, and Alberta and Ontario from Canada) over a follow-up period of approximately 20 years. Mor- tality rates and rate ratios for both women and men aged 60, 70, 80 and 90 years, with dementia as the underlying cause of death, were estimated using Poisson regression.

**Results:**
A total of 114,559 and 589,706 dementia deaths were ana- lysed in over 61 and 1,165 million person-years of follow-up for indi- viduals with and without diabetes, respectively. Trends in mortality from dementia varied by age groups and jurisdictions but were gener- ally consistent for both sexes. At ages 60 and 70, up to three juris- dictions showed increasing dementia mortality, while others showed uncertain trends. Notably, declines in dementia mortality were also observed, particularly among individuals without diabetes. At ages 80 and 90, mortality from dementia increased in up to six jurisdictions for both individuals with and without diabetes, with a more pronounced rise in those with diabetes. In Scotland, dementia mortality for indi- viduals with diabetes increased consistently, with increases ranging from 35.5% to 51.0% and 37.5% to 46.2% per five years for women and men, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Mortality from dementia has generally increased at older ages, with a more significant increase among individuals with diabetes. These findings highlight the potential impact of improving diabetes management on reducing dementia-related mortality, particularly in older age groups.

**Background and aims:**
Dementia is a devastating age-related condi- tion. With increased life expectancy of individuals with type 1 diabetes, this study aimed to investigate all-cause dementia risk in individuals with type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
43,440 individuals with type 1 diabetes from the Swedish National Diabetes Register and 217,109 age-, sex- and county-matched controls from the Swedish general population were included. Cox regression models were used to investigate the risk of all-cause dementia and dementia subtypes (Alzheimer’s disease, vas- cular dementia, and non-Alzheimer’s-non-vascular dementia). Addi- tionally, the relationship between various risk factors and all-cause dementia risk in type 1 diabetes was investigated.

**Results:**
Dementia was recorded in 530 individuals (1.2%) with type 1 diabetes and in 1,867 matched controls (0.9%) (median follow-up 14.3 [7.9-20.0] years; 44% women and mean age 33.0 (14.0) years). Individ- uals with type 1 diabetes had a higher risk of all-cause dementia (HR 2.02 [95%CI:1.83-2.23], Alzheimer’s disease (HR 1.38 [1.13-1.69]), vascular dementia (HR 3.73 [95%CI:3.07-4.52]) and non-Alzheimer’s- non-vascular dementia (HR 1.87 [95%CI:1.63-2.15]). Risk factors associated with a higher all-cause dementia risk in type 1 diabetes were higher age, lower education level, being single, higher systolic blood pressure, higher HbA1c, history of stroke/TIA, history of any cardiovascular disease and longer diabetes duration.

**Conclusion:**
Type 1 diabetes is associated with a higher risk of all- cause dementia and dementia subtypes compared to matched controls.

**Age-depedent Fgfr3 DNA methylation contributes to failure of adi- pose progenitor cells differentiating into beige adipocytes**

G. Zhichao

**Background and aims:**
Aging is accompanied by the decline in adipose tissue function and metabolic disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The reduced beige differentiation capacity of adipose progenitor cells (APCs) may be related to abnormal DNA methylation regulation. This study aims to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the reduced beige differentiation capacity of APCs during aging and explore potential intervention strategies.

**Materials and methods:**
APCs were extracted from humans and mice of different ages, and the expression of aging markers and beige dif- ferentiation genes was evaluated. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-Seq were used to analyze age-related methylation changes. An adipose progenitor cell-specific MBD2 knockout mouse model was established, and an in vitro hydrogen peroxide-induced aging model was used to study the regulatory role of MBD2 in beige differentiation. ChIP-PCR, luciferase reporter assays, and VEGFa- Fgfr3 interaction experiments were employed to elucidate the down- stream molecular mechanisms. Nano-particle encapsulated MBD2 siRNA was developed for intervention verification.

**Results:**
Aging significantly increased the β-gal activity in APCs, decreased the expression of thermogenic genes such as UCP1(62% decrease in 12-month vs 3-month mice, p < 0.001), and was accom- panied by changes in the whole-genome DNA methylation pattern. MBD2 was specifically upregulated in aged APCs and inhibited fgfr3 expression by binding to hypermethylated sites in the fgfr3 promoter region, resulting in impaired beige differentiation capacity. MBD2 knockout reversed the beige differentiation defect in APCs from aged mice, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced cold-induced thermo- genesis, with no effect on young mice. Fgfr3 is a key factor in beige differentiation, and its expression is regulated by the VEGFa-Fgfr3 signaling axis. Cold stimulation activates this pathway by inducing APC secretion of VEGFa. Targeting MBD2 with nano-siRNA effec- tively restored the beige differentiation function of aged APCs.

**Conclusion:**
Aging impairs the beige differentiation capacity of APCs through MBD2-mediated epigenetic silencing of Fgfr3. Targeting MBD2 can reverse this process. Oue study reveals the critical role of the MBD2-Fgfr3 axis in age-related metabolic disorders, providing a novel target for the development of epigenetic-based therapeutic strate- gies for metabolic diseases.

**Background and aims:**
Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with metabolic disorders and sarcopenia. We previously reported that miR- 494 is a negative regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis during C2C12 myocyte differentiation and endurance exercise in mice through post- transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial transcription factor A. We have also shown that miR-494 inhibits the formation of mitochondria- rich muscle fibers in human iPS myotubes. In this study, we used con- genital miR-494 knockout (KO) mice to investigate whether continuous suppression of miR-494 could ameliorate metabolic abnormalities and age-related changes.

**Materials and methods:**
KO mice were generated using the CRISPR/ Cas9 system, and their phenotypes were compared with those of Wild- type (WT) mice. Exercise capacity was evaluated by grip strength, treadmill forced running, and spontaneous activity in a rotating cage. In the high-fat diet (HFD) loading experiment, mice were fed a 45% HFD for 4 weeks starting at 12 weeks of age. Hemoglobin A1c was meas- ured before and after HFD feeding, and glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed after HFD feeding. Mice were maintained on normal chow until the end of their lives to compare lifespans. We defined aged mice as those over two years old and performed behavioral tests, grip strength measurements, histological evaluation, and Western blotting of skeletal muscle.

**Results:**
Body weight was comparable on normal chow. KO mice showed increased treadmill running distance compared to WT mice (WT 310.2±46.9 vs KO 433.4±30.2 m, p<0.05). In the rotating cage test, KO mice showed similar activity and food intake to WT mice but a trend towards greater weight loss. KO mice showed less weight gain (two-way ANOVA p<0.001), lower hemoglobin A1c (two-way ANOVA p<0.05), and improved glucose tolerance in the GTT (iAUC 30,244±2,911 vs 16,710±2,422 mg/dL*min, p<0.01) after 4 weeks of HFD. KO mice showed a 21% increase in median lifespan compared to WT mice (from 101.9 to 122.9 weeks). Aged KO mice showed reduced age-related changes such as hair graying, low physical activity, and muscle weakness (aged WT 3.57±0.11 vs aged KO 4.68±0.15 kg/kg body weight, p<0.0001). Muscle mass and fiber cross-sectional area were comparable, but increased fast-oxidative fibers were observed in the tibialis anterior muscle of aged KO mice. Expressions of mito- chondria-related proteins, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, succi- nate dehydrogenase A, and manganese superoxide dismutase, were increased in the skeletal muscles of KO mice, suggesting an improve- ment in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress clearance capacity.

**Conclusion:**
Deletion of miR-494 rendered mice resistant to diet- induced obesity and extended lifespan. The increase in fatty acid oxi- dation-dominant muscle fibers and improved oxidative stress handling likely contributed to the improvement of in metabolic abnormalities and healthy lifespan extension.

**Background and aims:**
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a metaboli- cally active organ that plays a central role in energy metabolism by dissipating nutrient energy as heat, in a process known as thermo- genesis. Conversely, white adipose tissue (WAT) stores energy as triglycerides, and obesity is a well-known risk factor for developing age-related diseases. Deterioration of BAT morphology and function, including impairment of thermoregulation and accumulation of white adipocytes, is frequently seen in the context of aging, and exacerbates metabolic dysfunctions like insulin resistance and obesity. Brown adi- pocyte thermogenesis largely relies on efficient nutrient metabolization of macronutrients for generation of heat in. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of increased age on macronutrient metabolism pathways in brown and white adipocytes in order to identify changes in nutrient utilization. As a result of these studies, we identified an amino acid metabolizing enzyme, L-Asparaginase, as an age-related candidate which we further assessed regarding its role in brown and white adipocyte function.

**Materials and methods:**
Murine brown and white adipose tissues of mice at different ages were assessed using transcriptomic, pro- teomic, and metabolomic approaches. function was assessed in transgenic mouse models with either genetic inactivating of the gene ( KO), or virus-mediated, tissue-specific overexpression in BAT or in inguinal WAT. Mice were metabolically challenged and the effects were analyzed in plasma and adipose tissue samples. Statistical analyses were conducted using unpaired Students’ t-test with Welch correction. A <0.05 was considered a statistically sig- nificantly difference.

**Results:**
Whole body inactivation of led to accumulation of asparagine in plasma and adipose tissue depots in basal state (n=7), and after 5 days of cold exposure (n=8). Additionally, mice with inac- tivation displayed metabolic dysfunction with enlarged adipocyte size in inguinal white adipose tissue depots (n=4-6; p-value<0.05, unpaired t test with Welch correction) and impaired thermoregulation (n=8). This could be linked to changes in adipogenic precursor cells isolated from BAT of KO compared to control littermates, which dis- played normal in vitro adipogenic differentiation capacity but a signifi- cantly reduced mitochondrial function (n=9-12). In accordance with this observation, overexpression of in brown adipose tissue led to higher metabolic flexibility (n=8), highlighted by an increased lipolytic rate under fasting (n=8). Further, an increased body temperature and lipid oxidation was measured in mice with overexpression in BAT or iWAT upon cold exposure (n=8).

**Conclusion:**
Our data show that L-Asparaginase controls the ther- mogenic function of brown adipocytes, such as regulation of nutrient metabolism and maintenance of body temperature. The identification of new regulators of brown adipose tissue function as well as the analysis of underlying molecular mechanisms may help to reveal possible novel targets to counter age-related metabolic perturbation.

**TUDCA enhances insulin sensitivity and restores skeletal muscle mass in aged mice**

M.S. Carvalho

**Background and aims:**
Aging is associated with metabolic dysfunc- tions, including insulin resistance, adiposity, muscle loss, and chronic inflammation. As a primary site for postprandial glucose disposal, skel- etal muscle is crucial for metabolic homeostasis, making its preserva- tion vital for healthy aging. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an endogenous bile acid, has shown potential to reduce body weight, blood glucose, cell death, inflammation, and endoplasmic stress in various models. Our group previously demonstrated that TUDCA improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in aged mice. Recent studies also suggest its potential to counteract muscle atrophy in disease mod- els. Thus, we aimed to evaluate TUDCA’s effects on glucose homeo- stasis, muscle mass, and function in aged mice.

**Materials and methods:**
To assess the effects of TUDCA, we used 3-month-old (Ct) and 18-month-old (Old) C57BL/6 mice treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of TUDCA at 300 mg/kg (OT) or its vehicle for 20 days. Muscle strength was assessed by maximum volun- tary carrying capacity (MVCC) and inverted screen tests. Body weight, fat depot weights, and skeletal muscle weights were recorded. Insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle was evaluated through AKT phospho- rylation after insulin stimulation, and protein synthesis was evaluated through puromycin incorporation. Molecular analyses were conducted using RT-PCR and western blotting. Histological sections stained with H&E were used to assess skeletal muscle integrity. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and presented as mean ± SEM, with statistical significance set at P ≤ 0.05.

**Results:**
Old mice presented an increase in body weight (BW - g: 29.70 ± 0.58 Ct x 33.52 ± 0.9 Old x 28.7 ± 0.99 OT), as well as in adiposity (% BW) (abdominal fat: 0.84 ± 0.03 Ct x 1.85 ± 0.14 Old x 0.91 ± 0.06 OT). Moreover, Old mice presented reduced skeletal muscle weight (%BW) (gastrocnemius: 1.06 ± 0.04 Ct x 0.84 ± 0.03 Old x 1.012 ± 0.06 OT; soleus: 0.05 ± 0.01 Ct x 0.002 ± 0.003 Old x 0.05 ± 0.003 OT) and loss of muscle strength (MVCC: 133 ± 4.67 Ct 100 ± 5.47 Old x 139 ± 9.55 OT; Inverted screen (s): 115 ± 9.82 Ct x 12.72 ± 1.3 Old x 56.05 ± 12.27 OT). This alterations in body composition were accompanied by increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in skeletal muscle (TNFα: 1.0 ± 0.11 Ct x 1.61 ± 0.24 Old x 0.82 ± 0.09 OT; IL1β: 1.0 ± 0.21 Ct x 5.13 ± 1.13 Old x 0.42 ± 0.09 OT; INFγ: 1.0 ± 0.20 Ct x 4.36 ± 0.40 Old x 0.86 ± 0.34 OT). Moreover, Old mice presented reduced phosphorylation of AKT following insu- lin injection (pAKT: 1.0 ± 0.12 Ct x 0.44 ± 0.08 Old x 1.09 ± 0.12 OT) indicating impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle. TUDCA treatment was able to reduce adiposity, improve skeletal muscle mass and strength, and increase and CSA (μm2: 2065 ± 188.2 Ct x 1132 ± 78.1 Old x 1642 ± 113.1 OT). Furthermore, TUDCA was very effec- tive in restore insulin signaling in skeletal muscle and increase muscle protein synthesis (Puromycin: 1.0 ± 0.02 Old x 1.37 ± 0.08 OT). Once chronic inflammation triggers insulin signaling, the anti-inflammatory effect of TUDCA plays a crucial role in enhancing insulin sensitiv- ity, increasing protein synthesis and restore skeletal muscle mass and function in Old mice.

**Conclusion:**
Our results suggest that TUDCA reduces skeletal muscle inflammation, enhances insulin sensitivity, mitigates muscle loss, and improves glucose metabolism in aged mice, making it a promising candidate for treating aging-related disorders.

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction is crucial for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and human islet transcriptome data can inform on molecular mechanisms at play in T2D. Glucolipo- toxicity impairs β-cell function and survival, potentially contributing to T2D onset and progression. Here, we mined human islet transcriptomes from non-diabetic (ND) and T2D donors for drug discovery aiming to restore β-cell function in glucolipotoxicity and T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Human islets were isolated from 43 ND and 27 T2D donors. T2D islets were cultured for 72h at 5.5 mM glucose. ND islets were exposed to 0.5 or 1.0 mM palmitate+oleate, molar ratio 1:2, plus 22 mM glucose (POG) or 0.75% BSA (control) for 48h. Transcriptomes (by bulk RNA-seq) of POG-exposed ND or T2D islets before and after 72h culture were mined for molecular mechanisms and identification of drug targets using the Connectivity Map. POG- exposed ND or T2D islets were treated with 4 μM baricitinib or 4 μM GSK046 or DMSO for 48-72h. β-cell function was assessed by static or dynamic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).

**Results:**
A 48h exposure of ND islets to POG induced β-cell dys- function. The glucolipotoxic transcriptome signature was related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress, mitochondrial dys- function and inflammation. After 72h culture at 5.5 mM glucose, GSIS improved in 60% of the T2D islet preparations. This was accompa- nied by changes in expression of >400 genes involved in functional or inflammatory pathways. To identify genes that could mediate β-cell functional recovery, we correlated changes in GSIS with gene expres- sion changes. Among the correlated genes, 14 have been previously linked to T2D, including IL24. Connectivity Map drug repurposing predicted chemical hits, including JAK and bromodomain inhibitors. The bromodomain inhibitor GSK046 and the JAK inhibitor barici- tinib improved GSIS of both POG-exposed ND islets and T2D islets. Baricitinib significantly downregulated IL24 expression in T2D islets.

**Conclusion:**
This study provides comprehensive insights into func- tional plasticity and transcriptome signatures of islets under glucoli- potoxic metabolic stress and in T2D. We experimentally validated predictions of drug classes that may restore β-cell function in T2D. Baricitinib and GSK046 induce β-cell functional recovery in glu- colipotoxicity and T2D, suggesting that they have therapeutic potential to mitigate β-cell dysfunction and deserve further preclinical and clini- cal investigations.

**Background and aims:**
Hyperglycemia accelerates β-cell dysfunction in diabetes by activating mTORC1 and promoting ER stress, though the upstream signals remain unclear. We studied glucosamine (GlcN), a glucose-derived amino sugar, in β-cell glucotoxicity.

**Materials and methods:**
We treated diabetic Akita mice with dapa- gliflozin or insulin and incubated human islets at 5.5 mM glucose (LG) or 22.2 mM glucose (HG) followed by metabolic labeling with C -glucose, metabolomics and metabolic fluxes analyses by LCMS. We studied the effects of glucosamine on β-cell function (GSIS and Seahorse), mTORC1 activity (Western blotting and immunostain- ing for pS6 and 4EBP1), ER stress (BiP immunostaining), and RNA- seq. We generated inducible β-cell-specific KO Akita mice to test the effects of inhibiting mTORC1 on diabetes, β-cell function and stress in vivo.

**Results:**
In diabetic mice, GlcN levels in tissues and plasma were elevated 2-3 fold and strongly correlated with blood glucose (r = 0.86- 0.98, n = 6). Treatment with dapagliflozin or insulin significantly reduced GlcN levels. In human subjects with impaired fasting glucose or T2D, the glucosamine metabolite GlcNAc-1P was significantly increased (log2 fold change = 0.47 ± 0.11 and 0.48 ± 0.13, respec- tively, < 0.01, n = 20) and correlated with fasting glucose, HbA1c, and reduced β-cell function (HOMA-B). In human islets, exposure to HG increased GlcN levels ~6-fold. C -glucose tracing showed that glucosamine is de novo generated by glucose amination. GlcN treat- ment activated mTORC1, evident by increased lysosomal localization of mTOR (fold increase of Pearson’s coefficient = 1.14 ± 0.075 in GlcN treatment vs control, < 0.05, n = 10) and phosphorylation of its downstream targets 4EBP1 and S6. Prolonged islets incubation at HG upregulated the expression of key enzymes of the hexosamine path- way, including (1.65 ± 0.07, < 0.05), (1.73 ± 0.14, < 0.05), and (1.42 ± 0.12, = 0.075). GlcN treatment significantly increased mitochondrial respiration (basal OCR= 0.1407 vs. 0.2335, Δ = 0.092 ± 0.025, < 0.05, n = 3) and GSIS (Δ = 6.634 ± 1.736, n = 14-16), indicating increased β-cell work; this was preventable by low-dose (10 nM) rapamycin, suggesting that the GlcN effects on β-cell work are mediated via mTORC1. RNA-seq on islets treated with GlcN revealed enrichment of genes involved in oxidative stress, ER stress, and mTORC1 signaling. Genetic mTORC1 inhibition in Akita β-cells (β AkitaKO) improved glucose tolerance, increased insulin content and decreased the expression of BiP. Treatment of diabetic Akita mice with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, followed by drug washout, showed that dapagliflozin inhibited mTORC1 activity, along with improvement of diabetes (IPGTT), decreased ER stress (BiP) and islet inflammation.

**Conclusion:**
Glucosamine is elevated in diabetes and induces sustained β-cell mTORC1 activation, promoting ER stress and dysfunction. Tar- geting the GlcN-mTORC1 axis may preserve β-cell function and slow diabetes progression.

**Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 inhibition or deletion in alpha cells enhances glucagon secretion at low glucose in mouse and human islets and improves glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese male mice**

F. Butaye

**Background and aims:**
The mechanisms of control of glucagon secre- tion are still largely unknown. In particular, it is unclear why glucose inhibits glucagon secretion while fatty acids stimulate it. These diver- gent effects may result from an intrinsic property of α-cells, potentially linked to their high expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). PDK1-4 phosphorylate and inactivate pyruvate dehydroge- nase, which converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. This study aims to investigate the role of PDK4 in α-cells in the control of glucagon secre- tion and glucose homeostasis.

**Materials and methods:**
The experiments were performed on islets or mice with ( ) or without ( ) deletion of specifically in α-cells and on human islets (IIDP). Islets were incubated for 1h in a medium with 5mM arginine, various glucose (G) concentrations (1 mM (G1) or 10 mM (G10), and, when indicated, with dichloroacetate (DCA, at 0.5 and 1mM), a PDK inhibitor. Insulin toler- ance tests (ITT) and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT) were performed on mice fasted for 4h. For ITT, due to sex-specific differences in insulin sensitivity, females received 0.7 U/kg and males 0.85 U/kg insulin (Actrapid). For IPGTT, 2g/kg glucose was injected intraperitoneally into mice fed a control diet (CTL) or a high fat diet (HFD; 60% of calories from fat for 16 weeks).

**Results:**
As expected, glucagon secretion was stimulated at low glu- cose (G1) compared to high glucose (G10). Interestingly, G1 stimulated more potently glucagon secretion in than in islets (by 70%; p<0.05). The addition of DCA (0.5mM for islets, 1mM for human islets) increased glucagon secretion in response to G1 (by 24%, p<0.05 in mouse islet and by 65%, p<0.01 in human islets). No differences in glucagon and in insulin secretion were observed at G10 between islets expressing or not . In CTL diet mice, glyce- mia after 4h of fasting was similar in and males or females. However, ITT revealed a reduced insulin-induced drop in glycemia in mice compared to mice of both sexes (glycemia of 46.2mg/dl in vs 76.8mg/dl in females, p<0.05; and of 60.5mg/dl in vs 90mg/ dl in KO males; p<0.05 at T=90 min). Glucagon levels 30 min after insulin injection were significantly higher in than in female mice (by 53%; p<0.01). IPGTT revealed no significant differences in glucose tolerance between and mice within the same sex. In HFD mice, glycemia after 4h of fasting or after insulin injection during ITT were similar in and males or females. IPGTT confirmed glu- cose intolerance in HFD mice compared to CTL diet mice. Notably, this glucose intolerance was less severe in males (glyce- mia of 327mg/dl in vs 239mg/dl in , after T=120min). However, no significant difference in glucose tolerance was seen between and female mice.

**Conclusion:**
These results demonstrate that deletion or inhibition of PDK4 in α-cells improves glucagon secretion in response to low glucose (G1) in mouse and human islets. This echoes the reduced hypoglycemic excursion in response to insulin in CTL diet mice. In addition, α-cell PDK4 deletion improves glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese male mice.

**Early-onset type 2 diabetes: association and mechanisms of gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolic disorders**

2. Hospital, Zhengzhou, China, Department of endocrinology, Henan

**Background and aims:**
Early-Onset Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (EOT2DM) has become a significant public health challenge globally, with an increasing trend of familial and early-onset occurrences. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) diagnosed before the age of 40 as early onset T2DM (EOT2DM), yet its precise pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Gut microbiota dysbiosis is considered a major driving factor for metabolic diseases. However, systematic studies on the gut microbiome and metabolic characteristics in EOT2DM patients are still limited.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study included 370 par- ticipants, consisting of 84 EOT2DM patients, 105 Late-Onset Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (LOT2DM) patients, 74 young healthy controls, and 107 elderly healthy controls. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. Additionally, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was employed to reconstruct the gut microbiota of EOT2DM patients in a germ-free mouse model to assess its impact on host metabolism.

**Results:**
The gut microbiota composition of EOT2DM patients was significantly altered compared to other groups, with a marked increase in the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Bacteroidaceae. KEGG functional prediction analysis revealed that the gut microbiome of EOT2DM patients showed significant enrichment in pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Addi- tionally, metabolite levels of Roseoxide, E-Methylthiocotanentrile, and Ethylbenzene were significantly higher in the feces of EOT2DM patients ( <0.001), while LOT2DM patients showed elevated levels of Codeine and Protopine ( <0.001). Correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between the abundance of Megamonas and Rumi- nococcus granus and glucose metabolism abnormalities and inflam- matory cytokine levels in EOT2DM patients. FMT experiments dem- onstrated that the gut microbiota of EOT2DM patients could induce more severe diabetic phenotypes in pseudo-sterile mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that EOT2DM-associated dysbiosis led to downregula- tion of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Claudin-1), increased intestinal permeability, and leakage of bacterial endotoxins (LPS) into the blood- stream, triggering a systemic inflammatory response (elevated IL-1β and TNF-α levels). Inflammatory cytokines potentially interfere with insulin signaling pathways, suppressing IRS/PI3K/Akt signaling and decreasing Pdx-1 expression, thus exacerbating insulin resistance and impairing β-cell function.

**Conclusion:**
This study elucidates the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and metabolic characteristics in EOT2DM patients and reveals their potential role in the pathogenesis of EOT2DM. These findings provide new insights for the early intervention and precision treatment of EOT2DM.

**Background and aims:**
Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) systems are transforming type 1 diabetes (T1D) care in children and young people (CYP), yet differences between platforms with automatic algorithm updates and cloud integration (AutoAID) versus manually adjusted/ uploaded systems (ManualAID) remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate predictors of glycaemic control, differences in gly- caemic outcomes, and onboarding efficiency across AID systems.

**Materials and methods:**
In this retrospective cohort study, 170 CYP with T1D were initiated on AID therapy between 2021-2024 at a UK tertiary centre (AutoAID n = 97, 80% Omnipod 5; ManualAID n = 73, 100% t:slim x2). CGM data were analysed at baseline and 12 months. Repeated measures mixed-effects modelling was used to assess predic- tors of time in normal glycaemia (TING: 3.9-7.8 mmol/L) across 3, 6, and 12-month timepoints. A hierarchical modelling approach was applied: demographic, glycaemic, and behavioural factors and excluded if non-significant. The final model retained four fixed effects: AID sys- tem type, automode usage, percent sensor use (PSU), and carbohydrate intake (g/kg/day). Collinearity diagnostics confirmed variance inflation factors (all < 5).

**Results:**
AutoAID and ManualAID cohorts had minimal demo- graphic differences and similar baseline glycaemic control. HbA1c improved by -6.3 mmol/mol in AutoAID users and -5.5 mmol/mol in ManualAID users (both p < 0.001). Time in range (TIR: 3.9-10.0 mmol/L) increased by 15% in AutoAID and 12% in ManualAID users (both p < 0.001). TING improved by 13% in AutoAID vs. 10% in ManualAID (p < 0.001), with a mean between-group difference of +3% (p < 0.05).The final mixed-effects model identified the follow- ing independent predictors of higher TING; AutoAID use: +4.2% (95% CI: 2.1 to 6.2, p < 0.001), PSU: +0.2% per 1% increase (95% CI: 0.1 to 0.3, p = 0.002), Automode usage: +0.2% per 1% increase (95% CI: 0.1 to 0.3, p < 0.001), Carbohydrate intake: +1.0% per g/ kg/day (95% CI: 0.6 to 1.4, p < 0.001). No significant interactions were observed between system type and behavioural predictors, sug- gesting AutoAID’s benefit was independent of user behaviour or device engagement. AutoAID systems also enabled more efficient onboarding, with 93% trained virtually versus 52% in ManualAID, resulting in a six-fold reduction in healthcare team time and patient travel.

**Conclusion:**
Both AutoAID and ManualAID systems significantly improved glycaemic outcomes over 12 months. AutoAID was asso- ciated with modestly greater improvements in TING and more effi- cient onboarding, likely reflecting the benefits of automated algorithm updates and cloud-based reviews. These findings support the practical advantages of fully integrated AID platforms in CYP care.

**Background and aims:**
Assessment of automated insulin delivery (AID) has been shown to improve glucose control both in clinical tri- als and from real-world data registries. The present nation-wide survey was conducted to assess the initiation process, the follow-up modalities, and the safety and effectiveness of AID in usual practice for 24 months in a large unselected population.

**Materials and methods:**
Adults and children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who initiated AID between January 1st and December 31st, 2022, were included in 79 centers. Clinical data, continuous glucose monitoring metrics, HbA1c levels and acute metabolic events were collected retrospectively at AID initiation, after 6, 12 and 24 months of follow-up. The results of the people with available data at initiation (n=2741), 6 months (n=2235), 12 months (n=2215) and 24 months (n=1373, preliminary data) are presented. Comparisons were con- ducted using Mann-Whitney test and Chi-square test according to assessed variables.

**Results:**
The mean [SD] characteristics of individuals at baseline were: age 38 years [29], 42% male, BMI 24.5kg/m2 [6.7], diabetes duration 19 years [20]. Half of the people was initiated on the Medtronic 780G and the other half on the Tandem Control-IQ. At 24 months, only 2.9% had stopped the AID while time spent on AID was high (91.6 [12.5]) for AID persistent users. The evolution of glucose metrics at 6, 12 and 24 months under AID are presented in Table 1. Improved time spent within target range and HbA1c levels remained stable between 12 and 24 months for all age categories, including children (< 13 years-old) and adolescents/young adults (13-24 years-old) in whom glucose con- trol was poorer at the initiation of AID.

**Conclusion:**
After 24 months of routine follow-up, adherence to AID was very high. Significant and persistent improvement of glucose control was observed throughout the 24 months, including all glucose metrics, supporting the benefits of AID in usual practice for people with T1D.

**Background and aims:**
Unannounced meals are a significant chal- lenge to therapeutic adherence in type 1 diabetes patients. This study compares the performance of two automated insulin delivery (AID) algorithms—the Medtronic 780g proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and the Tandem t:slim X2 model predictive control (MPC) system—in managing glycemic control during unannounced breakfast meals.

**Materials and methods:**
In a randomized crossover study, we enrolled 20 children aged 11-18 with no complications or malabsorption disor- ders, using either the Medtronic 780g or the Tandem t:slim X2. Gly- cemic metrics assessed included 2‑ and 4‑hour blood glucose change (∆BG), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) peak and time at peak, as well as time in range (TIR), above (TAR), below (TBR), and in tight range (TiTR). Participants consumed two breakfast types—a carbohy- drate (CHO) meal (bread and jam) and a mixed meal (bread and Ital- ian bresaola) each containing 30 g of carbohydrates (the mixed meal provided an additional 15 g of proteins)—under both announcing and unannouncing conditions. Patients were randomized in two groups: Group A first underwent announced meals followed by unannounced meals after a 7‑day washout; Group B followed the opposite order.

**Results:**
Unannounced meals (U.M.), compared to announced ones (A.M), yielded a significantly higher 2‑hour ∆BG (overall A.M. vs U.M. 2h-∆BG (mg/dl) 71.5 ± 44.9 vs. 30.9 ± 42.3 mg/dl, p<0.001), although 4‑hour ∆BG did not differ significantly. For U.M., only time at peak differed between the carbohydrate and mixed meals (overall Unannounced CHO vs Mixed meal time at peak (min) 91.2 ± 26.7 vs. 80.6 ± 23.5 minutes, p=0.023). In CHO A.M., PID and MPC algorithms exhibited comparable glycemic outcomes. However, during Mixed A.M., PID algorithm achieved a lower glu- cose peak, reduced TAR, and increased TiTR. During U.M., PID demonstrated a significantly lower 2‑hour ∆BG (U.M. PID vs MPC 2h-∆BG (mg/dl) 55.6 ± 36.3 vs. 87.3 ± 47.4 mg/dl, p<0.001), accom- panied by a lower glucose peak, diminished TAR (>250 mg/dl), and higher TIR, while differences in 4‑hour ∆BG and time at peak were not significant.

**Conclusion:**
Both algorithms mitigated postprandial excursions, returning glucose to pre‑prandial levels within 4 hours without safety issues. Notably, the PID algorithm exhibited a more reac- tive response to unannounced meals, whereas MPC’s performance remained comparable when meal bolusing was appropriately announced.

**Background and aims:**
Several randomized controlled trials have shown improvements in glycemic control during pregnancy using advanced hybrid closed-loop (aHCL) systems. However, no data are available evaluating the differences between these systems. The present study aimed to compare the glycemic control and pregnancy outcomes of three aHCL systems (MiniMed 780G, CamAPS FX, and Tandem Control-IQ) in a real-world, multicenter cohort of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Prospective observational study including 137 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes using aHCL from 27 hospi- tals in Spain. Participants were grouped according to the aHCL system used (85 Minimed 780G (62%), 38 CamAPS FX (27.7%), 14 Control IQ (10.2%)). Maternal glycemic control metrics (HbA1c and time spent within [TIRp], below [TBRp] and above [TARp] the pregnancy- specific glucose range 3.5-7.8 mmol/L) and pregnancy outcomes were analyzed. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used.

**Results:**
: CamAPS FX and Control-IQ users experienced a reduction in HbA1c by the third trimester (adjusted β -0.40; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.18; p=0.001 and adjusted β -0.37; 95% CI -0.71 to -0.02; p=0.037, respectively) compared to MiniMed 780G. CamAPS FX users showed the largest reduction in HbA1c by the third trimester (adjusted β -0.40; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.18; p=0.001) compared to MiniMed 780G. Control- IQ also demonstrated significant reductions (adjusted β -0.37; 95% CI -0.71 to -0.02; p=0.037). MiniMed 780G users had lower TBRp in the third trimester (Table 1). Both CamAPS FX and Control-IQ were asso- ciated with lower odds of large for gestational age infants (CamAPS FX: ­OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.08-0.72; Control-IQ: ­OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01-0.97) compared to MiniMed 780G.

**Conclusion:**
CamAPS FX and Control-IQ systems achieved lower HbA1c throughout pregnancy and lower neonatal weight compared to MiniMed 780G, highlighting the need for further research to confirm these results and inform clinical decision-making in order to optimize maternal and neonatal health.

**Interpreting type 1 diabetes risk across populations in the HLA region with genetics and single-cell transcriptomics**

J. Zheng, C. Guo, J. Weng

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a complex autoim- mune disease with a strong genetic component, primarily in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. However, the transethnic variability of HLA alleles associated with T1D susceptibility and their population- specific effects remain unclear.

**Materials and methods:**
We combined two approaches: a T1D asso- ciation analysis with HLA genotyping data from 60,695 individuals across Chinese and European populations and a single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis of T1D-associated HLA alleles in 797,329 cells from the pancreas and peripheral blood of 213 donors.

**Results:**
We identified 80 T1D-associated HLA alleles, including 34 transethnic shared risk alleles, 34 specific to the Chinese population and 12 specific to the European population. Among them, 8 alleles had not been previously reported. Despite representing only 42.5% of the T1D-associated alleles, the transethnic shared alleles accounted for 80.9% of significant phenotypic associations and 68.0% of significant eQTLs. Notably, was negatively correlated with age at diagnosis (Chinese: OR = 0.70, Padj = 1.32×10 ; European: OR = 0.75, Padj = 1.74×10 ), whereas showed a positive correlation (Chinese: OR = 1.43, Padj = 1.40×10 ; European: OR = 1.31, Padj = 4.26×10 ). These alleles regulated the majority of eQTLs, particularly in immune cells and pancreatic ductal cells. For example, was associated with decreased expression ( = -0.35, = 4.22×10 ), while was linked to increased expression ( = 0.62, = 2.64×10 ). Additionally, population-specific alleles exhibited unique regulatory effects in various immune cell populations. For instance, the Chinese-specific risk allele showed a significant association with elevated expression of —a gene implicated in the antigen-specific activation of ­CD8 T cells—in naive ­CD8 T cells ( = 5.28×10 , = 0.19), and memory ­CD8 T cells ( = 3.32×10 , = 0.18). The European-specific risk allele was associated with elevated expression of ( = 4.49×10 , = 0.18)—a gene upregulated during inflammatory conditions such as viral infections.

**Conclusion:**
These results highlight common and distinct genetic mechanisms associated with T1D susceptibility across populations and provide insights into immune regulation in T1D pathogenesis.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease with a complex and multifactorial aetiology, with around 90% of people affected having no family history of the disease. It is now recognized that autoantibodies against pancreatic cell antigens are sen- sitive and specific markers of early presymptomatic T1D. EDENT1FI is a European initiative which aims to screen children and adolescents for presymptomatic early-stage T1D, in healthcare and community settings.

**Materials and methods:**
The screening protocol involves a capillary blood sample and uses immunoassay techniques to screen for a selec- tion of antibodies, which include GAD, IA-2A, ZnT8, and IAA. In cases with multiple positive antibodies, confirmation is performed using a venous sample. Those with multiple antibodies are invited to join EDENT1FI Follow, which includes staging, clinical follow-up, and an educational program. At the present stage, the EDENT1FI screening program implemented pilot sites in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Czech Republic, and the United Kingdom.

**Results:**
The initial stage of the EDENT1FI deployment has effectively collected and assessed for the presence of autoantibodies, by March 2025, 47601 capillary blood samples from children and adolescents, representing 23.8% of the total project target goal. The first tier of screening suggested the presence of one or more autoantibodies in 1192 samples (2.5%). After the two-step confirmation process, 0.3% of sub- jects were found to be positive for two or more autoantibodies and were therefore classified as having early-stage T1D. From the individuals identified, 88 already accepted to be included in the staging protocol. A refusal to be included was observed only in one case. Among the staged individuals, 76% were characterized as being in stage 1,15% in stage 2, and 9% in stage 3.

**Conclusion:**
The applied screening methodology was shown to be suc- cessful in clinical, school, and sports settings. The identification of chil- dren and adolescents with presymptomatic early-stage T1D screening provided the opportunity for an early access to a staging and education program. It is also expected that, soon, early disease-modifying thera- pies will become available.

**Background and aims:**
The overlapping clinical features between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and atypical forms of diabetes, may lead to the misclassification between T1D and T2D. We aim to investigate the utility of genetic risk score (GRS) in the diabetes classification in Chinese individuals.

**Materials and methods:**
23,119 Chinese individuals with genotype data (668 T1D, 21,710 T2D and 741 healthy controls) in four prospec- tive cohorts from Hong Kong (established since 1995) were included. T1D was diagnosed based on clinical presentation of acute diabetic ketoacidosis and/or requirement of continuous use of insulin therapy within 12 months after diagnosis. T2D was diagnosed according to the 1998 WHO criteria. Among them, 6,481 (499 T1D and 5,982 T2D) had glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody (GADA) and fasting C-pep- tide measurements. Typical (biomarker-confirmed) T1D cases (n=217) were defined as T1D with GADA titer >5 IU/ml (GADA+) and severe insulin deficiency (ID+, fasting C-peptide <200 pmol/l), while typical T2D cases (n=3759) were T2D with GADA titer <5 IU/ml (GADA-) and C-peptide >200 pmol/l (ID-). T1D GRS-2 (67 SNPs, European), T1D C-GRS (33 SNPs, Chinese) and one T2D whole-genome GRS for Chinese (~ 1 million SNPs) were calculated by plink and PRS-CS. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the discrimination performance of GRS.

**Results:**
T1D C-GRS showed better performance in classification between typical T1D and T2D than European T1D GRS-2 (AUC=0.86 [0.83, 0.89] vs 0.80 [0.75, 0.83], p=1.3×10 ). T2D GRS also showed fair classification performance (AUC=0.71 [0.66, 0.75]). Among the uncertain cases (n=1698), a subgroup of T2D with GADA+ ID+ (n=107) had T1D and T2D GRSs similar to typical T1D group, which could be T1D cases misclassified as T2D. Subgroups of T1D with GADA- ID- (n=16) and T2D with GADA+ ID- (n=157) or GADA- ID+ (n=1191) had T1D and T2D GRSs similar to typical T2D group. We trained a machine learning model combining T1D and T2D GRSs, age at diagnosis and BMI to classify between biomarker-confirmed T1D and T2D, and predict on clinically diagnosed T2D individuals without GADA or C-peptide measurements (n=14,259). 124 T2D cases (0.9%) were reclassified as T1D, which had a significantly higher pro- portion (14.5% vs 4.3%, p=2.5×10 ) of insulin initiation within 3 years after diagnosis.

**Conclusion:**
T1D and T2D GRSs showed clinical utility in discrimi- nation between typical T1D and T2D cases confirmed by GADA and insulin status, and identifying misclassification in Chinese individuals. In people without these biomarkers, the GRSs could help identify those who need early insulin treatment. Combining T1D and T2D GRSs with clinical features can improve classification of T1D and T2D to ensure appropriate insulin use.

2. versity of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, Novo Nordisk Foun-

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) frequently co-occur, suggesting a shared genetic basis. However, to date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have iden- tified only a limited number of overlapping genomic regions contribut- ing to both diseases. This study aimed to identify a latent genetic factor linking glycemic and atherosclerotic traits, and to assess its predictive utility for CVD comorbidity in T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
We applied structural equation modeling on GWAS summary statistics for glycemic traits (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, 2-hour glucose, and T2D) and atherosclerotic traits (coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and aortic aneu- rysm). We computed a genome-wide polygenic score for the identified latent factor and evaluated its predictive value for CVD comorbid- ity in T2D among European participants from the All of Us cohort (n=215,881), including 5,501 individuals with both T2D and CVD.

**Results:**
The structural equation model demonstrated an excellent fit (CFI = 0.988, SRMR = 0.045, ²(20) = 163.24) and identified 266 independent genomic regions associated with the latent factor. Each standard deviation increase in the polygenic score was associated with a higher likelihood of CVD comorbidity in T2D, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.56-1.66). In combination with age, sex, and BMI, the polygenic score achieved an AUC of 0.829 (95% CI: 0.818- 0.839), outperforming other CVD-specific polygenic scores.

**Conclusion:**
These findings provide evidence for a shared genetic basis linking dysglycemia and atherosclerosis. The derived polygenic score demonstrates significant predictive power for CVD comorbidity in T2D, which could offer potential for improved risk stratification and targeted interventions in this high-risk population.

**Recessive TMEM167A variants are a novel cause of neonatal dia- betes, epilepsy and microcephaly syndrome**

**Background and aims:**
Identifying the genetic causes of rare dis- eases affecting pancreatic beta cells and neurons provides insights into pathways essential for development and function of both cell types. Microcephaly, epilepsy and diabetes syndrome (MEDS) is a congenital disorder characterised by neonatal diabetes diagnosed before the age of 6 months, early onset epilepsy, and severe microcephaly. Autoso- mal recessive variants in and have been previously described as causes of MEDS. Both genes play a key role in the endo- plasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi protein trafficking. The aim of this study was to identify novel genetic causes of MEDS.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed genome sequencing in 2 individuals with clinical features of MEDS. All known genetic causes of neonatal diabetes had been excluded. Homozygosity analysis from genome data revealed a percentage of homozygosity of 1.23% in Proband 1 and 8.04% in Proband 2. We therefore prioritised homozy- gous rare coding variants affecting the same gene in both individuals. Replication studies were performed using next generation sequencing in 284 additional patients diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 6 months without a known genetic cause; 7 also had microcephaly. We used an exon trapping assay to assess the effect of the p. Gly38Glu variant on splicing, using a custom-designed pSPL3 vector transfected into HEK293 cells.

**Results:**
was the only gene with a homozygous rare cod- ing variant in each proband; p.Arg52Trp in Proband 1 and p.Val59Glu in Proband 2. Replication studies identified 4 further unrelated individ- uals with biallelic variants: 3 homozygous (p.Arg52Trp, p.Ser67Glnfs*15, p.Gly38Glu) and 1 compound heterozygous for two variants (p.Ile18Lys and p.Cys46Arg). All variants are absent or extremely rare in gnomAD and are classified as likely pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines. The p.Gly38Glu variant affects the last nucleotide of exon 2 and is predicted to affect splicing rather than result in a missense change. An exon trapping assay con- firmed that this variant causes skipping of exon 2, which is predicted to result in a frameshift (p.Ser2Ilefs*13), consistent with complete loss of protein function. All 6 individuals with biallelic vari- ants were diagnosed with diabetes in the neonatal period (median age at diagnosis 34 days, range 1 day - 22 weeks) and were insulin treated from diagnosis (median insulin dose 1.13 U/kg/day, range 0.6 - 1.7). 4/6 individuals had low birth weight (median adjusted birth weight Z score -2.08, range -2.87 to 1.99). 5/6 patients had epilepsy diagnosed in the neonatal period and all had severe microcephaly (median head circumference -8.9SD, range -4.17 to -10.3). Five were deceased (age of death ranged from 2 months to 14.8 years). Large-scale proteomic studies have suggested that TMEM167A co-localises with YIPF5 and IER3IP1, consistent with TMEM167A sharing a similar function in ER to Golgi transport, underlying the aetiology of MEDS.

**Conclusion:**
recessive loss of function variants are a novel cause of MEDS. Our results highlight a previously unsus- pected critical role of TMEM167A in beta cells function, showcas- ing the power of gene discovery studies in individuals with severe phenotypes.

**Characterisation of HNF1A-MODY in Asia: mutation profiles and clinical manifestations**

J. Tang

**Background and aims:**
MODY is estimated to account for 1-2% of all diabetes cases, with HNF1A-MODY being the most common subtype. Most studies on HNF1A-MODY have been conducted in Europe and North America. This study aims to analyze mutation data and provide an overview of the clinical characteristics and epidemiological patterns in the Asian population affected by HNF1A-MODY.

**Materials and methods:**
We collected data from 38 studies and reports on Asians with HNF1A-MODY, comprising a total of 97 probands, sourced from PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. The search terms included: "maturity-onset diabetes of the young" or "MODY" or "maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3" or "MODY3"or "HNF1A-MODY" or "TCF1 mutation"

**Results:**
A total of 67 distinct amino acid alterations were identified in the HNF1A protein. Among 97 probands, 89 (91.8%) had HNF1A- MODY due to coding region mutations, while 8 (8.2%) had mutations in noncoding regions. The most common mutations were in exons 1 and 4, with missense mutations predominating. In the DNA-binding domain, 67.2% of mutations were missense, while in the transactiva- tion domain, 62.9% were frameshift. Of the probands, 74.2% were diagnosed under 25 years, and 94.8% had a family history of diabetes or hyperglycemia. Age of onset was younger for mutations in the trans- activation domain (16.2 years) compared to the DNA-binding domain (20.5 years) and DNA dimerization domain (24.8 years). At diagnosis, 82.5% were normal weight or underweight. Elevated levels of TC, TG, and LDL were observed. Treatment included insulin alone (21.6%), sulfonylureas alone (16.5%), and a sulfonylurea combination (12.4%).

**Conclusion:**
In the Asian population, the most common cause of HNF1A-MODY is missense mutations in the coding region of the gene, particularly in exons 1 and 4 of the DNA-binding domain. The age of onset, family history, FBG, HbA1c, 2h-PG, fasting C-peptide, BMI, and lipid profile may serve as key diagnostic indica- tors for HNF1A-MODY.

2. Sweden, Department of Endocrinology, Skåne University Hospital,
3. Malmo, Sweden, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.

**Background and aims:**
Monogenic diabetes is a rare form of diabe- tes caused by pathogenic variations in single genes. These variations can lead to reduced insulin secretion, as seen in beta-cell subtypes, or reduced insulin action in insulin-resistant subtypes. The most com- mon form of monogenic diabetes is Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). Distinguishing certain forms of monogenic diabetes from type 1 and type 2 diabetes can lead to treatment differences and improved outcomes. Our previous research has shown that immigrants from the Middle East develop diabetes at an earlier age, experience a more rapid decline in beta-cell function, have a stronger hereditary predisposition, and exhibit no significant obesity compared to patients from Sweden, i.e. a MODY-like phenotype. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of monogenic diabetes among patients with adult-onset diabetes from the Middle East residing in Sweden.

**Materials and methods:**
We recruited all patients with Middle Eastern backgrounds participating in the ANDIS study from 2008 to 2022. ANDIS is a representative cohort of diabetes patients in Southern Sweden. A total of 39 patients met the following criteria: a parental history of diabetes, BMI <30 kg/m2, age at diagnosis before 40 years old, fasting C-peptide > 0,3 nmol/l, and absence of GAD antibodies. Of these, DNA was available for genetic analysis in 30 patients. A next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of 54 genes was performed.

**Results:**
Only 1 out of 30 patients (3.3%) was found to be heterozy- gous for a pathogenic frameshift variant in the RFX6 gene. Monoal- lelic pathogenic variants in RFX6 cause MODY, subtype RFX6. This patient, originally from Egypt, was diagnosed with diabetes at 32.4 years old, had a BMI of 27.1 kg/m², fasting C-peptide of 0.68 nmol/L, and an HbA1c of 98 mmol/mol at diagnosis.

**Conclusion:**
This is the first report indicating a relatively low preva- lence of monogenic diabetes among Middle Eastern immigrants living in Sweden. These findings highlight the strong polygenic background of diabetes in this population, suggesting that monogenic diabetes is not a significant contributor to diabetes prevalence in Middle Eastern individuals with adult-onset diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is monogenic, autosomal dominant diabetes, occurring in 1 - 2 % of the population. People with glucokinase (GCK) - MODY are usually asymptomatic with mild fasting hyperglycaemia. GCK-MODY may be misdiagnosed as the more commonly encountered gestational diabetes (GDM), reducing opportunities for intervention and family screening. Although risk factors for GCK-MODY in pregnancy are defined within white populations, there is an urgent need to clarify prevalence and risk factors in a multi-ethnic cohort. Aim - To identify if the current GCK-MODY screening pathway using NHS England R142 Glucokinase-related fasting hyperglycaemia genetic testing guidelines, effectively identifies affected women in an ethnically diverse maternity population in the UK.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective observational study in a single tertiary centre serving an ethnically-diverse com- munity. We identified women who had a pregnancy with gestational diabetes in 2023, who met screening criteria. We reviewed our local database with data on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), BMI and ethnicity to identify those who should have had genetic testing undertaken, with an expected delivery date of the first half of 2023.

**Results:**
During the study period, we identified 431 women with GDM from antenatal hospital records, including 126 (29%) white women, 277 (64%) from multi-ethnic backgrounds, and 28 (6.5%) women with missing information. We identified 29 women (6.7%), 79% non-white and 21% white, who met criteria for GCK-MODY testing in pregnancy, with FPG between 5.5 to 8 mmol/L and BMI below 30 kg/m if white or BMI below 27 kg/m for other ethnicities. Only one of these women was tested (result negative). Following this a catch up programme was undertaken to review those women who should have been tested. This resulted in 12 women tested with FPG and were normal; 8 women were tested with HbA1c (36 to 58 mmol/ mol) and were normal; and 7 women did not attend postnatal test- ing. Furthermore, 9 women (78% non-white and 22% white) tested with FPG or HbA1c have met the criteria for further GCK-MODY testing; 6 women tested negative and 3 had samples lost and are being re-tested.

**Conclusion:**
We have identified that within our centre testing for GCK-MODY is frequently overlooked. Retrospective testing has practical difficulties and doesn’t offer the same diagnostic value as testing during pregnancy. We plan to update our antenatal pathway to ensure routine testing of eligible women is undertaken.

**Background and aims:**
MODY is a type of monogenic diabe- tes caused by defects in genes involved in the development and function of the pancreatic beta cells. Distinct MODY-subtypes are defined by genes (e.g., , , , , ) with and being the most prevalent. However, studies have shown that MODY is often misclassified as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Here, we aim to characterize the MODY-population at a spezialised diabetes outpatient clinic.

**Materials and methods:**
After obtaining consent, data were col- lected from health records, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of relevant clinical information.

**Results:**
We collected from 144 individuals with disease-causing variants in MODY-genes. Results include data from individuals diag- nosed with diabetes (n=126, 88%): -MODY (n=14); - MODY (n=33); -MODY (n=71); -MODY (n=6) and -MODY (n=2). The current age of individuals was 44 [33; 54] years (median [IQR]) and the age at diabetes diagnosis was 22 [15; 31] years. The time from diabetes diagnosis to genetic screening was 8 [1; 19] years (not including individuals screened prior to dia- betes diagnosis (n=6)). One year after diagnosis, diabetes was clas- sified as MODY (n=50, 40%) or other types of diabetes (e.g., type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)) (n=58, 46%) (missing data: n=18, 14%). The included figure shows the misdiagnosis categorised by different MODY types. Most individuals had at least one first-degree relative with diabetes (n=116, 94%), while a history of diabetes in three generations was less common (n=80, 65%). Current BMI: 24 [22; 26] kg/m and HbA1c: 51 [45; 56] mmol/mol. Microvascular complications were infrequent in individuals with -MODY (n=2 (8%)) compared with other subtypes (n=47 (53%)).

**Conclusion:**
In individuals diagnosed with MODY, who have early onset of hyperglycaemia, a normal-range BMI and a strong family history of diabetes, we find that microvascular complications are common in non-GCK-MODY. Further, misdiagnosis remains a sig- nificant challenge.

G. Bonfield, S.E. Flanagan, E. De Franco, M.B. Johnson

**Background and aims:**
When autoimmune diabetes presents in the first 6 months of life or is associated with other autoimmune conditions during childhood, it may result from a pathogenic variant in a gene critical for immune regulation. Identifying and diagnosing individuals with these monogenic forms of autoimmune diabetes has implications for genetic counselling and ongoing clinical management. Recessively inherited variants in which encodes the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor, cause immunodeficiency syndrome 41. To date, only single cases and families have been reported, and the diabetes phenotype in these patients remains poorly described. We aimed to identify and further characterise individuals with pathogenic variants by screening a large cohort of patients with either infancy-onset diabetes or diabetes associated with additional autoimmune conditions.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed targeted next generation sequencing of in 290 individuals who presented with diabetes in the first 6 months of life, and 64 individuals with diabetes diag- nosed between 6m-10y with at least one other autoimmune disease. All other causes of monogenic diabetes were excluded by sequencing. Islet autoantibody testing was performed using an automated ELISA assay. Clinical data was collected through a dedicated referral form. We also reviewed other reported cases through a literature search.

**Results:**
We identified 5 unrelated individuals with biallelic disease- causing variants. Four were homozygous (two protein truncating variants [PTVs], one whole gene deletion, one missense variant); one individual was compound heterozygous for a PTV and missense vari- ant. All variants were pathogenic/likely pathogenic according to the Academy of Clinical Genomic Science variant interpretation guide- lines. 4/5 individuals were diagnosed with diabetes within the first month of life and one was diagnosed at 8 years. All individuals were insulin treated from diagnosis (Mean 1.45 U/kg/day, range 0.2-2.5 U/ kg/day) and had low/absent C-peptide (range 0.72-1.12 pmol/L, n=3). The mean glucose at presentation was 43.71 mmol/L (range 22-65 mmol/L). GADA autoantibodies were positive in 4/4 patients tested, strongly supporting an autoimmune aetiology. Through our literature search, we identified 14 additional cases from 10 families, each with different homozygous pathogenic variants. Of these, 8 had dia- betes, bringing the total number of cases with diabetes to 13/19 (68%). The age at diagnosis of diabetes was reported for 7 of the 8 individuals, ranging from 2 days to 1 year, with 4 diagnosed in the first month of life. Islet autoantibody testing results were reported for 3 previously reported cases which confirmed the presence of GADA. No evidence of a genotype/phenotype relationship or differences in additional features were found between those with and without diabetes in our cohort and the wider literature.

**Conclusion:**
Autoimmune diabetes is a common feature in patients with pathogenic biallelic variants in and often presents in the first weeks of life. should be included on panel tests for both neonatal diabetes and suspected monogenic autoimmune diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Gene discovery studies in individuals with neonatal diabetes (NDM) can provide key insights into pancreatic beta cell biology by highlighting genes vital for development and function. Historically animal models such as mice have been used to model the effects of gene depletion on the pancreas, but key differences exist between murine and human pancreatic development, including in the transcription factor genes that control the process. The aim of this study was to gain insights into the human specific effects of the loss of genes involved in beta cell development and function by performing gene discovery studies in individuals with genetically unsolved NDM.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed genome sequencing in 43 indi- viduals with NDM in whom all known genetic causes of the disease had been excluded. All were born to related parents and were therefore likely to have a homozygous cause for their disease. 19/43 had transient NDM (TNDM) characterised by diabetes remittance in infancy and relapse later in childhood/adolescence. Functional characterisation was performed using quantitative PCR and RNA-Seq in genome-edited human induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC)-derived islet cells and CUT&RUN sequencing in a human beta cell model.

**Results:**
We identified 2 unrelated individuals with NDM caused by homozygous loss of function variants in ; one with a p.(Arg126*) stop-gain variant and the other with a c.-352_104del deletion affecting the first 4 exons and gene promoter. Both individuals had TNDM, with remittance occurring at 7 and 8 months and relapse at 2.4 and 6.7 years. Both were insulin treated at diagnosis and upon relapse and had low birthweights (-1.16, -2.98 SD), consistent with reduced insulin secretion. Neither had any additional disease features. CRISPR modelling of the p.(Arg126*) variant in iPSC-derived pan- creatic cells confirmed that it causes nonsense-mediated decay and as such, both variants are expected to completely ablate PAX4 protein expression. Functional profiling of the role of PAX4 in human beta cell development and function using integrated analysis of CUT&RUN and RNA-Seq data generated in human endocrine progenitor and beta cell models showed that PAX4 directly regulates the expression of multiple genes known to be involved in pancreatic beta cell development and glucose sensitive insulin secretion, including the gene itself.

**Conclusion:**
We describe the first cases of complete loss of in humans, establishing it as a novel cause of TNDM. Previously, the gene has been shown to be vital for murine pancreas development with Pax4 knockout mice developing diabetes at birth due to a complete absence of pancreatic beta cells. Through functional studies we have shown that in humans PAX4 has a similar role in the specification of beta cell fate from endocrine progenitor cells. However, the transient phenotype of the two individuals with homozygous variants indicates that, unlike in mouse, PAX4 expression is not essential for beta cell devel- opment in humans.

3. Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, Department of Clinical Medi-

**Background and aims:**
Sulfonylureas (SU) constitute first-line treat- ment for individuals with MODY caused by pathogenic variants in (HNF1A-MODY or MODY3). However, SU are associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia and does not always result in adequate glycaemic control. Evidence for treatment of HNF1A- MODY is limited, and more studies are needed to clarify the use of incretin-based treatment. Using real-world data, we described the use of incretin-based treatment (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors) in individu- als with HNF1A-MODY.

**Materials and methods:**
Individuals with a disease-causing variant in who had been prescribed either a GLP-1RA or a DPP4 inhibitor were included. Data were manually extracted from health care records at time of initiation of a GLP-1RA or DPP4 inhibitor (baseline) and after 2 to 4 years (follow-up).

**Results:**
Out of 71 individuals with HNF1A-MODY, 35 individu- als had initiated incretin-based treatment and were included (11 men [32%], mean age at baseline 46 [SD 17] years, age at diabetes diagnosis 21 [13] years, microvascular complications n=11 [31%], macrovascular complications n=6 [17%]). At follow-up, metabolic parameters had improved, and prevalence of hypoglycaemia had decreased (Table 1). Of the 17 insulin-treated individuals at baseline, nine individuals (53%) had discontinued insulin at follow-up and had improved glycaemic control (HbA1c -7.8 [13.1] mmol/mol), decreased body weight (-6.0 [1.6] kg) and reduced self-reported hypoglycaemia (n = 5/8 [63%] at baseline vs. 0/7 [0%] at follow-up).

**Conclusion:**
Individuals with HNF1A-MODY who initiated incretin- based treatment had clinically relevant reductions of HbA1c, body weight, and hypoglycaemia three years after initiation. More than half of the insulin-treated individuals stopped insulin after initiation of incretin-based treatment. Improvement of metabolic parameters can be caused by other factors than the initiation of incretin-based treat- ment and randomised studies are required to establish the benefits of incretin-based treatment in individuals with HNF1A-MODY.

**Background and aims:**
confers the strongest genetic risk for type 1 diabetes (T1D), including the initiation of islet autoimmunity (IA) and the progression from IA to clinical T1D. Killer cell immunoglob- ulin-like receptor (KIR) physically interact with HLA class I molecules in an allele-dependent manner to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. KIR genetic effects in T1D have been understudied, likely because KIR resides in a highly complex genomic region that is meas- ured with insufficient resolution using high-throughput technologies. We used specialized imputation methods to investigate the association of genetic variation and - pairwise variation with the risk of T1D, IA, and T1D progression in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) cohort.

**Materials and methods:**
TEDDY follows high-risk children for the development of T1D.  Genome-wide SNP data were gener- ated from a customized Illumina exome array and the Immunochip for N=8,089 children. As of July 31, 2023, 413 T1D cases (mean 7.8 years) and 882 IA cases (mean 5.2 years) had developed in the cohort. We imputed genes with KIR*IMP after TOPMed R2 imputation and with the Michigan HLA multiethnic reference panel. Cox regression was used to test for associations between IA or T1D and gene copy number (15 genes) and - pair- wise combinations ( and categorized as present/absent, 9 pairs). The models were adjusted for the high-risk HLA genotype DR4- DQA1*030X-DQB1*0302 / DR3-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201, genetic PC1 and, in case of T1D progression, also for age at IA seroconver- sion. We assessed significance at <0.05 for main effects and <0.1 for interactions.

**Results:**
KIR imputation accuracy ranged from 87% to 99%. The effect of on T1D risk and T1D progression dif- fered by the presence of HLA Bw4 epitope, a putative ligand. In the absence of Bw4, increased T1D risk (interac- tion =0.057, HR=1.28, 95%CI: 0.97-1.68) and T1D progres- sion risk (interaction =0.067, HR=1.56, 95%CI: 1.16-2.08). In the presence of Bw4, had no association with T1D risk or T1D progression. Both (HR=0.78, 95%CI: 0.66-0.93) and (HR=0.79, 95%CI: 0.67-0.93), which are in strong LD, were protective for T1D progression. (HR=1.17, 95%CI: 1.03-1.34) increased the risk of T1D progression. Results were simi- lar for , , and , which are in strong LD with . We identified no associations between genes or pairs and IA risk.

**Conclusion:**
Genetic variation of affects the development of T1D. These effects differ by the presence of HLA ligands and by phase of T1D. KIR3DS1 activates NK cell effector functions. Confirmation of Bw4 as a ligand for KIR3DS1 has been contentious and is likely pep- tide dependent. Identification of this receptor as a risk in the absence of Bw4 may indicate an alternative ligand. Further elucidation of allelic variation is warranted to allow for allele-specific elucida- tion of receptor-ligand effects in T1D risk.

**Background and aims:**
Protein glycation products are linked to vas- cular complications in diabetes. While genetic variants associated with fructosamine and glycated albumin have been identified in the general population, the genetic determinants of protein glycation products in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) remain unknown. By using genome wide association study (GWAS), we aimed to identify variants associated with serum protein glycation products in T1D and investi- gate their association with cardiovascular and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included 588 individuals with T1D from the FinnDiane study. Protein glycation products fructosa- mine, AGEs, and methylglyoxal-modified hydro-imidazolone (MG-H1) were measured by colorimetric and fluorometric assays or ELISA. The individuals were genotyped with HumanCoreExome BeadChips, and association between genetic variants and glycation products was tested with score test with rvtests software, adjusted for age and sex. The results were filtered to include variants with minor allele count (MAC) ≥10. Associations with <5×10 were considered genome-wide sig- nificant, and <1×10 as suggestive. Lead variants were followed up by exploring their associations with phenotypes reported in the GWAS Catalog as well as with DKD outcomes retrieved from GWAS on DKD (JDRF-DNCRI, ­n =19,406). Additionally, their effects on gene expression were evaluated in blood (eQTLGen), kidney tissue (Human Kidney eQTL Atlas), and other tissues (GTEx v8) using pub- licly available datasets.

**Results:**
Median [IQR] age was 43 [33, 53] years, diabetes duration 29 [15, 38] years, and 52% were men (n=304). Median concentra- tions of fructosamine were 1.69 mmol/l [1.57, 1.82], AGEs 13800 AU [10300, 22600], and MG-H1 1.90 μg/ml [1.53, 2.55]. An inter- genic variant, rs57648012 showed robust association with MG-H1 (β=0.8, p=9.7×10 ), while rs146809042 in a regulatory region was suggestively associated with fructosamine (β=-0.9, =1.8×10 ). Intronic variants rs2184103 (β=0.4, =6.5×10 ), and rs62559895 (β=0.4, =1.2×10 ) were suggestively associated with AGEs. Based on the GWAS catalog AGEs-linked variant rs2184103 was associated with coronary artery disease (β=0.06, p=2×10 ), and variant rs62559895 was associated with annual healthcare costs (β=0.02, p=3×10 ) and a proxy variant with BMI ­(r =0.89, β=0.01, p=3×10 ). In a GWAS on DKD, rs2184103 was associated with CKD (β=-0.10, p=0.029) and ESKD (β=-0.13, p=0.025). Further, from GTEx and eQTLGen data, rs2184103 was associated with expression ( =7.5×10 ) in adipose tissue, and rs62559895 linked to across vari- ous tissues, notably in the kidneys (β=-0.49, =5.9×10 ) and the blood ( =3.3×10 ). MG-H1-related variant rs57648012 linked to in nerve-tibial tissue (p=0.00002).

**Conclusion:**
We here report novel genetic variants associated with serum glycation products in individuals with T1D, with further associa- tions to coronary artery disease, BMI, and tissue-specific gene expres- sion potentially suggesting their role in cardiometabolic risk and DKD.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterised by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. People with T1D are typically diagnosed at a young age and therefore exposed lifelong to the environment of chronic hyperglycaemia, which increases the risk of vascular complications. However, some persons remain free from developing major diabetic complications even after a very long disease duration, so called non-progressors or “escapers”. We have previously demonstrated that DNA repair processes and genes medi- ating immune tolerance responses as central mechanisms protecting patients with long-term T1D from developing vascular complications. In the present study we aimed to investigate the potential to identify protective autoantibodies that may, by modulating immune responses, prevent tissue damage.

**Materials and methods:**
We have performed plasma proteograph analyses of 7,174 proteins and 82,033 unique peptides using Seer technology platform in 160 participants (115 non-progressors [age, yrs, mean/s.e. 54.1 ± 1.0, 31%males]/ 45 rapid progressors [age, yrs, mean/s.e. 45.3 ± 2.2, 53%males]) from the Scandinavian PROLONG (PROtective genetic and non-genetic factors in diabetic complications and LONGevity) cohort. Non-progressors were defined as those with T1D duration of more than 30 years and who did not develop any major complications (diabetic nephropathy, proliferative retinopathy, myocardial infarction, stroke or chronic foot ulcer), whereas rapid progressors were defined as those, who developed nephropathy and retinopathy within 25 years of T1D duration.For identifying and quan- tifying potential antibodies in the samples, we used the DIA_SpecLib_ Quant workflow in FragPipe, with a database containing human Uni- Prot proteins (both reviewed and unreviewed, canonical and isoform; accessed on 2024/07/25) and 25.9 million CDR3 peptides extracted from 245 million heavy-chain antibody sequences from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS, https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/oas/). We compared mass spectrometry-based antibody intensities in non-pro- gressors and progressors samples to identify antibodies exclusive to non-progressors.

**Results:**
Based on mass spectrometry-based antibody intensities, we identified 27 antibodies from the UniProt database and 96 CDR3 anti- body peptides from the OAS database that were exclusively present in the non-progressors samples. Additionally, among the antibodies detected in both non-progressors and progressors groups, we found 551 antibodies from the UniProt database and 69 CDR3 antibody peptides from the OAS database that exhibited significantly higher intensity in non-progressors samples (FDR p<0.05). Studies on the association of these antibodies and their titers with cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical phenotypes are currently in progress.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the findings from this study for the first time suggest the presence of autoantibodies in patients with long- standing T1D without major complications that can have protective roles. The provenance of these autoantibodies and their mechanisms of action remain to be investigated.

**Background and aims:**
Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are emerging as a novel tool for prevention and management of cardio-renal-metabolic (CRM) disease. In this study, we describe results from the first year of implementing clinical PRS testing for CRM disease in a large com- munity health system.

**Materials and methods:**
From January to December 2024, CLIA- certified polygenic risk score (PRS) testing for type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) was implemented at Endeavor Health. A retrospective chart review and descriptive statistical analysis were con- ducted to assess patient/provider characteristics and impact on clinical decision-making. Results were stratified based on population standard- ized PRS risk: high risk (≥2× for T1D or ≥1.5× for other conditions) vs low/average risk (<2× or <1.5×, respectively).

**Results:**
Of 153 patients with PRS testing, 66% were male, 12% non- white, 5% Hispanic, 25% with diabetes, and 31% with heart disease. Mean age was 54 ±13 years, HbA1c 5.8 ±0.7%, LDL 104.6 ±40.3 mg/dL, and eGFR 89 ±17 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Clinicians ordering PRS (n=33) were 72% male, 45% cardiologists, 15% endocrinologists, and 21% primary care physicians. Majority of PRS results (93%) were returned via an online patient portal. High risk T1D and T2D PRS patients had higher proportions of endocrinology referrals and rel- evant laboratory testing (Table 1). Patients with high obesity PRS had a higher mean BMI (29.0 ±8.5 kg/m2, n=8) vs patients with a low/ average obesity PRS (26.2 ±4.7 kg/m2, n=57). Additionally, a higher proportion of patients with high obesity PRS had initiated weight loss medications after testing vs low/average risk (13%, n=1 vs 7%, n=4). Patients with high CKD PRS had a similar average eGFR (89 ± 19.30 mL/min per 1.73 m2, n=6) to patients with low/average CKD risk (91 ± 19.26 mL/min per 1.73 m2, n=59). Among all patients tested, one patient with a high risk CKD PRS was referred to nephrology in follow-up (17% of high-risk CKD PRS). Patients who tested as high CAD PRS risk vs low/average risk had a lower mean LDL (96.56 ±43.35 mg/dL, n=28 vs 106.43 ± 39.68 mg/dL, n=124) and higher past use of cholesterol lowering medication (75%, n=21 vs 60%, n=75). A greater proportion of high CAD PRS risk patients vs low/average had a history of CAD, atrial fibrillation, or abdominal aortic aneurysm (46%, n=13 vs 28%, n=35). Excluding patients with history of heart disease, 11% of high CAD PRS risk patients (n=3) had lipid lowering therapies initiated/intensified in follow-up vs 2% of low/average CAD risk patients (n=2).

**Conclusion:**
This study offers real-world insights into PRS adoption in clinical care. Findings suggest PRS may influence clinical decision- making, guide early intervention, and personalize management.

**Background and aims:**
Differences in glycemic control and hypogly- cemia risk presented by second-generation insulin analogs have been studied. However, it is known that insulin acts on gene regulation in various metabolic pathways. Therefore, it is important to understand its effects on gene expression levels, particularly those involved in the insulin signaling pathway, as these effects remain largely unknown. So, we tried to evaluate potential differences in the gene expression of the insulin signaling pathway in leukocytes from adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), depending on the treatment with different long-acting basal insulin analogs, using data from the INEOX study.

**Materials and methods:**
INEOX is a 24-week controlled clinical trial comparing two groups of T1DM patients (diagnosed over 2 years ago, treated for more than 1 year with rapid-acting insulin analogs, and with HbA1c above 10%) who were randomly assigned to treatment with Glargine U300 (Gla300) or Degludec U100 (Deg100). Work carried out:1. Screening via RNA-Seq of a panel of 128 genes (Ion Torrent AmpliSeq RNA) related to the insulin signaling pathway: 40 T1DM patients (20 per group; matched by age, sex, HbA1c, and dis- ease duration).2. Validation by qPCR of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in the screening, in a new cohort of 151 T1DM patients (79 treated with Gla300 and 72 with Deg100). Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood (PaxGene tubes) and reverse tran- scribed to cDNA in both the screening and validation cohorts. RNA- Seq data were analyzed using R software (packages: Limma, EdgeR, DESeq2) after TMM normalization, and validation data were analyzed using the 2^(-ΔΔCT) relative quantification method; reference genes: GAPDH and β-ACTIN.

**Results:**
The screening identified several DEGs between treatment groups, notably STOX1 and SOCS2. The Deg100-treated group showed increased expression of STOX1 and decreased expression of SOCS2 compared to the Gla300-treated group. In the validation phase, using independent sample t-tests, no statistically significant differences were observed in the expression levels of either gene between treat- ment groups in the overall analysis. However, when stratified by sex, significant differences were found for the SOCS2 gene in women only (p<0.05), where those treated with Deg100 showed a greater decrease in SOCS2 expression compared to those on Gla300.

**Conclusion:**
Our results suggest the potential differential regulation of the insulin pathway gene SOCS2 in adult women with T1DM treated with different second-generation long-acting basal insulin analogs, as differences were observed depending on the insulin analog used.

**Background and aims:**
This study investigated the longitudinal lipid- omic profiles of newly diagnosed children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) over the first-year post-diagnosis and explored genetic associations with lipid traits through a genome-wide association study (GWAS). By integrating lipidomics and genotypic data, we aimed to identify and replicate genetic variants influencing lipid metabolism in the early stages of T1D and assess how these relationships evolve over time.

**Materials and methods:**
The plasma lipidome (352 lipids) in a cohort of children diagnosed with T1D from the Danish Remission Phase Study, Glodko (discovery Cohort, N=106) and New Remis- sion Cohort (validation cohort, N=78) was profiled at three visits (1, 6 and 12 months). Genotyping was performed using ImmunoChip and Global Screening Array and SNPs were imputed at the whole genome level with the HRC panel using Michigan Imputation Server for both discovery and validation cohort, respectively. Lipid levels were rank- based inverse normalized and transformed after adjustment for age, sex, center, and IDAA1c. Univariate lipid-SNP associations were performed using linear mixed models (FaSTLMM) and considered significant if their P-value was lower than 5e-06 . Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed to identify a lead variant per genomic region. Pleiotropic effects of lipid influencing SNPs were identified based on correlations with HbA1c and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) evidence from the GTEx repository. Gene and lipid enrichment analysis were performed at each visit to evaluate the evolution pattern during the first year of T1D. Significant lead variants were validated in the validation cohort using the same linear mixed model.

**Results:**
A total of 183, 193, 137 lead variants were found in the dis- covery cohort at 0, 6, 12 months, respectively. Variant rs174549 located in FADS1/FADS2 region was significantly associated with phosphati- dylcholines at all three visits; 0 (effect size (β)=1.07, P=4.63e-06), 6 (β=1.12, P=5.6e-09) and 12 (β=1.09, P=7.7e-07) and associated with increased HbA1c levels at 6 months. Gene-set enrichment analysis showed overrepresentation of genes involved in immune-related bio- logical processes at all three visits. Lipid-based enrichment analysis showed a bigger prevalence of Glycerophospholipids within associa- tions at 6 months compared to at 0 and 12 months. ~70% of the lead variants had evidence for eQTL data with a few of them being tissue- specific for T1D-related tissues such as pancreas and whole blood. ~10% of lead variants were validated in the validation cohort with a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value < 0.05.

**Conclusion:**
To our knowledge, this is the first study that assesses genetic associations with the lipidome in T1D individuals. Moreover, we aimed to observe the evolution pattern of them across the first year of diagnosis, which is critical for the understanding of the initial meta- bolic changes in the onset of the disease. Our findings suggest a heavy influence of immune-related variants driving lipid changes during the first year of diagnosis, although additional research studies are needed for proper validation.

**Background and aims:**
Identifying biomarkers of functional β-cell loss is critical in risk stratification for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). We developed a microRNA-based dynamic (responsive to the environment) risk score using generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-driven machine learning (ML) approaches for circulating microRNAs assessed across multi-context cohorts.

**Materials and methods:**
Discovery (wet-lab and dry-lab) analysis identified 50 microRNAs, measured across n=2,204 plasma samples from individuals from four contexts (4C=AUS/Australia, DNK/Den- mark, HKG/Hong Kong SAR China, IND/India). A multi(4)-context, microRNA-based dynamic risk score (DRS4C) was generated using Random Forest Machine Learning workflow. A GAI pipeline was developed to train T1D or T2D predictive models using augmented data (Synthetic + Train data) on the 50 microRNAs and participant age at sample collection. T2D stratification was assessed in individuals with T1D (n=1,314) and those with T2D (n=131). Predictive power for cell or drug efficacy was analyzed in islet transplant and the Imatinib clinical trial samples and, risk stratification was carried out in a Danish and an Australian cohort of individuals at risk of T1D using an isola- tion forest machine learning algorithm.

**Results:**
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) enhanced T1D risk stratification with a good predictive power (AUC=0.84) for Controls Vs T1D stratification in an independent multi-context Validation-set (n=662), and accurately predicted future exogenous-insulin require- ment at one-hour of islet transplantation in Canadian (CAN, n=31) recipients (n=85 longitudinal study samples). In a clinical trial assess- ing an emerging T1D therapy, baseline microRNA signature, but not the clinical characteristics, stratified 1-year response to Imatinib. In a T2D Vs T1D test cohort, a subset of these 50 microRNAs offered accurate stratification of T1D from T2D, to achieve T1D misdiagnosis using this microRNA-based dynamic risk score.

**Conclusion:**
This is the first report of a microRNA-based dynamic risk score demonstrating the potential of such biomarkers that change in response to the environment to stratify T1D risk, avoid T1D misdi- agnosis, and enhance cell and drug efficacy prediction in T1D therapy.

**Background and aims:**
Understanding how the drivers of earlier type 2 diabetes (T2D) onset differ between south Asian and white popula- tions is crucial, as south Asians develop the condition, on average, a decade earlier than white Europeans. Body mass index (BMI) can underestimate adiposity and cardiometabolic risk in south Asians, especially at lower thresholds. It remains unclear how genetic risk for adiposity influences earlier T2D onset across ancestries and to what extent BMI mediates this relationship.

**Materials and methods:**
Mediation analysis was conducted separately for south Asians (n=3,901, Genes & Health) and white Europeans (n=729, UK Biobank) aged 40 years or older, using enhanced poly- genic score (PGS) for BMI, clinically measured BMI and age at T2D onset. Since most PGS include the UK Biobank population, we used an enhanced PGS, developed on an external population and trained in subgroups of the Genes & Health and UK Biobank populations. This ensures no overlap between development and evaluation datasets and comparability of results across ancestries. Analyses were adjusted for sex, non-HDL cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and rel- evant principal components (PCs). For Genes & Health cohort, we used multivariable linear regression with backward selection to identify the best PGS for several adiposity indicators (waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), body fat per- centage (BF), trunk fat (TF) and gluteofemoral fat (GFAT)) predicting age at T2D onset.

**Results:**
A one standard deviation (SD) increment in PGS for BMI was associated with earlier T2D onset by -0.73 years (95%CI -1.01; -0.45) in south Asians and -0.33 years (95%CI -0.49; -0.16) in white Europeans. In spite of the stronger effect observed in south Asians, BMI fully mediated the PGS effect in white Europeans (100%) and only partially in south Asians (30%). Alongside PGS for BMI, best predictors of early onset T2D in south Asians were WC, WHR, BF and GFAT. Predictors of early T2D onset differed between south Asian subgroups and by sex. In sex-stratified, sub-ancestry analy- ses we found PGS for WC (explaining 0.4% and 0.5% variance in males and females, respectively) in British Bangladeshis and PGS for WHR (explaining 0.6% and 0.4% variance in males and females, respectively) in British Pakistanis were the best predictors of early T2D onset after PGS for BMI.

**Conclusion:**
These findings highlight the need to explore alternative mechanisms for the role of adiposity and fat distribution in T2D risk in general and early onset in particular for south Asians. This study indicates the potential for incorporating central adiposity indicators alongside BMI in improving the assessment of cardiometabolic health in South Asians, particularly for those with lower BMI.

**Background and aims:**
Elevated amino acid levels have been asso- ciated with both incident type-2 diabetes and dementia. However, it is unclear whether type-2 diabetes in fact mediates the relationship between amino acids (branched chain and aromatic amino acids) and brain health/dementia risk, and whether this may be causal. Our study aimed to use Mendelian randomization analysis to disentangle these associations in the UK Biobank.

**Materials and methods:**
Our branched chain and aromatic amino acid genetic instruments comprise, respectively, 33 and 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the latest genome-wide association study. Type 2 diabetes was defined by questionnaire and glycated haemoglobin. Brain imaging measures include hippocampal volume, and total volume of white matter hyperintensities. Mendelian randomisation analyses used an inverse-variance weighted approach and MR-Egger as a sensitivity analysis for unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy.

**Results:**
There were 39,135 individuals with brain imaging and qual- ity-controlled genetic data. We report an F-statistic of 93 and 159 for our instruments for branched chain and aromatic amino acids respec- tively. Inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomisation showed little compelling evidence of a causal association between amino acid metabolism and brain health outcomes, and with type 2 diabetes in UKB.

**Conclusion:**
In the UK Biobank we observed weak causal associations between branched chain and aromatic amino acids, dementia-related brain health outcomes, and type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Although studies have identified genetic risk factors associated with diabetes mellitus, personalized risk stratifica- tion for the development of various diabetes-related complications remains poorly understood. Moreover, it has been unclear whether rare genetic variants with large effect sizes, rather than common variants with small effects, are associated with specific diabetic com- plications. This study aimed to investigate the impact of diabetes- related rare variants on various types of diabetic complications.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a case-control study of approximately 240,000 participants using short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from All of US Research Program, which includes ethnically diverse populations linked to electronic health records and demographic data. Rare variants (minor allele frequency <0.1%) were defined as high-confidence loss-of-function (LoF) or deleterious missense variants, and gene-level burden was tested for association with diabetes and diabetes-related complications using a logistic mixed-effects model. Diabetes and diabetes-related compli- cations were identified using binary phenotypes based on Phecode derived from ICD-9 and ICD-10 (v 1.2). We categorized diabetic complications into seven groups: Retinopathy, nephropathy, neu- ropathy, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and metabolic complications, and overall severity based on diabetic complications and severity index (DCSI).

**Results:**
We observed rare variants in and were significantly associated with diabetes mellitus. Among 31,217 patients with diabetes mellitus, 39 were variant carriers and 37 were variant carriers. Patients with variants exhib- ited lower body mass index (BMI), lower fasting glucose levels, and higher HDL cholesterol levels. Patients with variant showed lower fasting glucose and triglyceride levels. Analyses of Diabetes-related complications revealed that variant carri- ers had a lower risk of diabetic nephropathy (OR 0.22, = 0.04), while variant carriers showed an increased risk of diabetic neuropathy, with the association approaching statistical significance (OR 2.21, P = 0.06). There was no significant difference in DCSI between or variant carriers and non-carriers.

**Conclusion:**
In patients with diabetes mellitus, rare genetic variants were associated with distinct diabetes-related complications. These findings suggest that patients with diabetes mellitus may exhibit dif- ferent risks for each component of diabetic complications depending on their genetic variants, highlighting the need to develop predictive models and early intervention strategies.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and elevated blood pressure (BP, including systolic and diastolic) are complex frequently co-occurring conditions. Understanding shared genetic factors between them could aid deciphering mechanistic relationships between T2D and BP regulation.

**Materials and methods:**
We dissected the effects of 563 T2D and 999 BP variants established using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), by constructing polygenic score (PGS) in a set of 457,386 European individuals from UK Biobank. We gathered Z-scores from GWAS on 49 endophenotypes and utilised them to cluster 1,542 inde- pendent genetic variants into distinct pathophysiological processes and investigated cluster-specific PGSs for comorbidity. Using colocalisation analyses across 50 tissue-specific eQTL datasets and chromatin acces- sibility data from 222 cell types (single-cell ATAC-seq), we identified the biological context of these clusters.

**Results:**
We classified T2D-/BP-associated genetic variants into five biologically distinct mechanistic clusters: metabolic syndrome, higher adiposity, vascular dysfunction, reduced beta-cell function, and a newly discovered inverse T2D-BP risk cluster. This inverse cluster links higher T2D risk to lower BP and reduced cardiovascular risk, with enrichment in retinol metabolism loci, suggesting a novel biological pathway driving this unique profile. T2D overall PGS was associated with risk of elevated BP, and vice versa ("P-values"≤0.0167). Charac- terisation of clusters revealed significant enrichment in thyroid tissue, pancreatic islets, and foetal regulatory elements. Cluster2 co-localised genes had enriched co-expression in adipose subcutaneous, thyroid and artery tibial tissues tissues (PP.H4.abf>0.8). We highlight the role of thyroid function in BP regulation, a known clinical feature, previously missed by genetic studies. We confirm the central role of pancreatic islets in T2D pathogenesis and identify foetal regulatory elements, also previously missed within hypothesis-free omics characterisations of genetic studies, as key contributors to intrauterine growth pathways, linking early developmental processes to adult onset of both conditions. A 15-year survival analysis in the UK Biobank showed a persistent, linear increase in risk for individuals in the top tertile of cluster-based PGS distributions. These refined scores also revealed distinct patterns of complications, allowing for early identification of younger individu- als at heightened risk and enabling targeted preventive interventions.

**Conclusion:**
Partitioned PGS enhances comorbidity risk prediction and clinical applications. Using cluster-specific PGS, we improved predic- tion of lifelong comorbidity risk for T2D and BP.

**A pilot study on genetic variants associated with GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment response**

Y. Kim

**Background and aims:**
There are individual differences in glucose lowering effect and weight reduction of dulaglutide, long-acting gluca- gon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. It is expected that genetic variations in the mechanism of action of drugs can help predict the treatment response of patients. This study aims to investigate genetic variants associated with long-term efficacy and weight reduction of dulaglutide using targeted next-generation sequencing.

**Materials and methods:**
We recruited patients those who were treated with dulaglutide at least one year after switching from DPP-4 inhibitors (±basal insulin) due to uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c ≥8.0%). We collected 3 cc blood samples from 77 patients who gave informed consent at VHS medical center Between September 2018 and Octo- ber 2019, and followed up until March 2021. Exclusion criteria were malignancy and steroid treatment. The responder was defined by ≥1.0% HbA1c reduction at 24 weeks and achievement of HbA1c ≤7.5% at 52 weeks. We designed targeted exome panel based on the mechanism of drug action, and candidate genetic variants included known GLP-1 response related genes (n=10), gastric emptying related genes (n=18), pancreatic insulin secretion related genes (n=25). At the same time, we also performed whole exome sequencing using DES V9 (Celemics, Seoul, Korea).

**Results:**
Thirteen of 77 patients discontinued dulaglutide within 1 year as shown in Fig 1. The responder was defined by ≥1.0% HbA1c reduction at 24 weeks and achievement of HbA1c ≤7.5% at 52 weeks. According to the response, the patients were divided into groups from R0 to R3, and there was no difference between the groups except for the baseline HbA1c. During follow-up period of median 2.5±1.3 years, HbA1c was 9.7±1.3% at baseline and reduced to 8.2±1.5% at 6 months, and maintained thereafter up to 4 years. Risk alleles in GNB3, SPARC, and COL4A1 genes were more frequently shown in responders (R3, n=23) compared with nonresponders (R0, N=14). Glycemic effec- tiveness of dulaglutide therapy is negatively associated with genetic variants in SPARC gene (OR 0.426, 95% CI 0.188, 0.966, p=0.041) as well as GRS (OR 1.781, 95% CI 1.172, 2.706, p=0.007). Weight loss (n=13) was more frequently observed in patients with minor G alleles of COL4A1 gene (OR 2.681, 95% CI 1.089, 6.601, p=0.032).

**Conclusion:**
The GNB3, SPARC, and COL4A1 genes were associ- ated with an effective treatment response to GLP-1RA, and genetic variants near the COL4A1 gene were also correlated with weight loss. This might be a potential clue to the mechanism of weight reduction in dulaglutide therapy, though further studies are required for validation.

**Background and aims:**
There are established relationships between type 2 diabetes and several forms of common cancer. In fact, cancer is the most common cause of death patients and it is shown that some genetic loci are shared between type 2 diabetes and cancer. However, which genetic loci contribute to type 2 diabetes only and which loci are responsible of diabetes along with cancer is yet to be investigated. We aimed to elucidate the single genetic loci shared between T2D and four cancers through multi-phenotype genome-wide association studies (MPGWAS).

**Materials and methods:**
We combined individual genome-wide array data of 36,173 individuals from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer, including 10,855 type 2 diabetes, 4,126 postmenopausal breast, 2,111 colorectal, 473 pancreatic and 419 prostate cancer cases with pooled controls from all disease cohorts. We QCed and imputed the data against the Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panel. We performed MPGWAS using the reverse regression approach where the genotype is outcome and disease are included as predictors, as is imple- mented in the SCOPA software. At identified loci we also evaluated the results for all different model combinations, including single trait analysis performed within SCOPA, and used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for each model to determine the best fitting phenotype combina- tion. We considered a BIC difference of >10 as very strong evidence for divergence between models, 6-10 as strong and >2 as supportive.

**Results:**
Within MPGWAS using a five-disease model, we identified 137 association signals ( <5x10-8), 21 of them were previously estab- lished for the named diseases. Out of the 21 signals five were previ- ously associated with type 2 diabetes; CDKN2B, IGF2BP, SLC30A8, EIF2S2P3, HLA-DQA1, three with type 2 diabetes and breast cancer; TCF7L2, FTO, CDKAL1, two with prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes; HLA-DQB1, TNXB and finally three loci within the HLA region asso- ciated with colorectal, prostate cancers and type 2 diabetes; HLA-C , HLA-DRB5, HLA-DQA1(2). We compared BIC across models which included type 2 diabetes only versus MPGWAS models including type 2 diabetes and one or more of the cancers In the single phenotype (SP) model of type 2 diabetes, oci SLC30A8, EIF2S2P3, IGF2BP2 and CDKN2B had the highest BIC as compared to MP models with strong improvement in model fit criteria (minimum deltaBIC > 6.4 ). However, models including variation (6:32585456) intergenic to HLA- DQA1 was best fit when we included breast, colorectal cancer in addi- tion toT2D with significant improvement in BIC (deltaBIC=59.5).

**Conclusion:**
Through the improved power via implementation of MPGWAS we highlighted a clear contribution of HLA-DQA1, breast and colorectal cancer cancers in addition to type 2 diabetes pointing multi-phenotype effects underlying co-occurrence of these outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease are significant global health challenges, with genetic factors playing a crucial role in their development and progression. These conditions frequently co-occur with hypercholesterolaemia, and might re-represent as a side effect in individual taking lipid-lowering thera- pies. This study aimed to investigate the influence of missense variants in the gene, a target for respective inhibitors used to lower blood LDL-cholesterol, on blood glucose levels and T2D suscepti- bility using data from the UK Biobank. Specifically, the objective is to explore whether genetic variability in , known for its role in lowering LDL cholesterol through PCSK9 inhibitors, also impacts glucose metabolism.

**Materials and methods:**
We employed single-variant and combined- variant analyses to evaluate the associations between missense variants and metabolic traits in ~450,000 UK Biobank individuals with whole-exome sequencing data. We applied advanced statistical techniques to analyse genetic data and identify potential relationships between coding DNA variants and metabolic outcomes, including hier- archical clustering, Burden, SKAT, and SKAT-O tests implemented in R statistical environment and PLINK and SAIGE software tools.

**Results:**
The single-variant analysis revealed significant associa- tions between rs374014696 (Ala242Val, OR [95% CI] 0.51 [0.40- 0.65], p=1.022×10−7) and rs773660398 (Ala44Thr, OR: 1.50 [1.26-1.78], p=6.735×10−6) alternative alleles and random glucose values, while accounting for age, sex and time since last meal, thus suggesting involvement in glucose metabolism. Addition- ally, clustering upon SKAT-O tests identified four distinct clusters of missense variants, having at least one of them with glu- cose levels and T2D effect opposite to the effect on LDL-choles- terol. missense variants thus exhibit diverse effects on lipids and glucose metabolism phenotypes.

**Conclusion:**
These findings indicate a genetic basis for varied responses to PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, highlighting the complexity of genetic influences on metabolic health. Our results suggest the need for genetic profiling in optimising treatment strategies for cholesterol man- agement, with the potential to enhance personalised approaches and reduce metabolic and glycaemic side effects. Further research across diverse populations is required to validate these results and to fully elucidate the genetic factors involved.

**Improving type 2 diabetes machine learning-based prediction accu- racy with SNPs and younger age**

P. Zalloua, vidou, H. Hatzikirou, A. Abchee, S. O’Sullivan

**Background and aims:**
Early detection of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) through modern technologies like machine learning (ML) can reduce complications and improve quality of life. This study aims to evalu- ate six machine learning-based models using clinical and epidemio- logic data alone and in combination with genomics data, to determine whether the combined data significantly improves the predictive power of these models in identifying Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) risk.

**Materials and methods:**
Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Decision Tree (DT) were trained on a discovery dataset (N=3,546) and externally validated using the UK Biobank (N=29,970). Models were evaluated, based on Precision and Accuracy to identify diabetes patients early across three settings: clinical data, clinical combined with genomics data, and age-stratified subgroups (>55 vs. ≤55 years).

**Results:**
In the discovery dataset, RF and SVM achieved the high- est performance using clinical variables alone, with family history of T2D, hypertension, and cholesterol levels consistently emerging as top predictors across all models. Incorporating SNP data improved predic- tive performance across all machine learning models, with notable contributions from T2D-associated variants such as rs7903146 and rs7756992. Validation in the UK Biobank dataset revealed a substantial increase in performance across all models, with AUC values of 90% on average. Improvements from SNP integration were most pronounced in individuals aged ≤55, emphasizing the benefit of including genomics data for early T2D risk stratification. While clinical features remained the dominant predictors, the inclusion of genetic information enhanced the models’ ability to discriminate between T2D cases and controls.

**Conclusion:**
While clinical factors remain the primary predictors of T2D, the inclusion of genomics data significantly improves model per- formance, especially among young adults. The use of both discovery and replication datasets highlights the generalizability of these findings and underscores the importance of a multi-dimensional approach in improving predictive accuracy for T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i) are oral glucose-lowering drugs which reduce cardiovascular and renal complications. Despite its efficacy, SGLT2i exhibit hetero- geneous responses across individuals with type 2 diabetes. We aim to identify novel circulating miRNAs predictive of glycaemic response at 6 months with SGLT2i and their expression changes before and after treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
We utilized a nested case-control design and selected good and poor responders from the Hong Kong Diabe- tes Biobank (HKDB), matched by gender, age, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, and drug usage (metformin, sulphonylurea, Dipeptidyl pepti- dase-4 inhibitor, and insulin) before initiation of SGLT2i. Glycaemic response to SGLT2i was defined by median change in HbA1c in the study cohort. We stratified individuals based on difference in HbA1c pre-treatment and the lowest HbA1c within six months post-treatment. Individuals with HbA1c reduction (∆) > median change were classi- fied as “good responders” and those with (∆HbA1c) ≤ median change as “poor responders”. Using the OpenArray platform, we quantified 754 miRNAs by TaqMan based real-time PCR in plasma from base- line EDTA samples followed by global normalization. The differen- tially-expressed miRNAs were analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In an independent cohort with stored samples pre- and post-treatment, good responders were selected for small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify paired dif- ferential expression in miRNA using edgeR in R software.

**Results:**
Among 4,621 individuals with type 2 diabetes from the HKDB cohort newly initiated with SGLT2i, the median difference in HbA1c post-treatment was -0.83%, with 2,309 good responders (∆HbA1c > 0.83%) and 2,312 poor responders (∆HbA1c ≤ 0.83%). The selected 30 good and 30 poor responders exhibited similar mean age (55.2 vs 54.9 years, p=0.929) and HbA1c (7.96% vs 8.22%, p=0.443) at baseline. In the OpenArray platform, 7 miRNAs detectable in at least 50% of samples in each group were differentially expressed (p<0.05). ROC analysis indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of the 7 identified miRNAs ranged from 0.608 to 0.715 when used as single marker. The combined 7-miRNA signature achieved an AUC of 0.809. Using small RNA-seq, we identified 16 candidate miRNAs with differential expression (p<0.05) pre- and post-treatment in good responders. These differentially-expressed miRNAs were enriched with pathways associated with diabetes and its complications.

**Conclusion:**
Profiling of miRNAs may offer the potential to predict treatment responses and enhance precision diabetes care.

**Background and aims:**
Tissue crosstalk regulates metabolic homeo- stasis in type 2 diabetes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and associated microRNA (miRNA) cargo are emerging regulators. Physical activity is an effective intervention for type 2 diabetes and modulates the EV- miRNA profile, but its differential response during disease progression remains unclear. This study aims to characterize the EV-miRNA profile in response to acute exercise in men with type 2 diabetes and inves- tigate its associations with the skeletal muscle transcriptome, clinical parameters, and physical performance.

**Materials and methods:**
Men with type 2 diabetes (n = 14) or nor- mal glucose tolerance (n = 13) completed a 30-minute high-intensity cycling session at 85% of their maximum heart rate. Clinical and per- formance-related variables were assessed before exercise, and blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected before (baseline), immediately after (post), and 3 hours after exercise (recov- ery). EVs were isolated from serum, followed by total RNA extraction and enrichment for small RNA. Small RNA sequencing was performed upon library preparation to identify exercise-induced changes in the EV-miRNA profile.

**Results:**
Exercise induced different temporary alterations in the EV- miRNA profile in men with type 2 diabetes compared to those with normal glucose tolerance. At the start of the study, men with type 2 diabetes showed a dysregulated miRNA profile, with higher expression of miR-148a-3p (1.52-fold, p-value < 0.001, FDR = 0.16). Exercise- induced changes in EV-miRNA expression revealed a different response in both groups, with men with type 2 diabetes being less sensitive. In normoglycemic men, exercise increased levels of let-7c-5p (1.76-fold, FDR = 0.044) and miR-6873-3p (3.70-fold, FDR = 0.055). In men with type 2 diabetes, exercise also raised miR-6873-3p levels, but this was not significant, suggesting a diminished response to exercise in the diabetic group. The recovery response to exercise also showed a specific profile: men with type 2 diabetes had a lower response, with a trend toward increased levels of miR-143-5p (2.30-fold, FDR = 0.197), while normoglycemic men showed a significant increase in miR-331-5p (2.51-fold, FDR = 0.008). Correlation analysis at the start of the study showed that miR-148a-3p levels in EVs from men with type 2 dia- betes were inversely correlated with baseline expression of (r = -0.97, FDR = 0.004) and (r = -0.97, FDR = 0.004) and positively correlated with baseline expression of (r = 0.96, FDR = 0.004) and (r = 0.95, FDR = 0.012) in skeletal mus- cle, genes linked to lipid metabolism and post-transcriptional protein modification, suggesting a potential link between miRNA alterations and muscle dysfunction.

**Conclusion:**
The serum EV-miRNA profile is different between men with type 2 diabetes and men with normal glucose tolerance, suggesting that EV-miRNAs could play a role in metabolic regulation. However, men with type 2 diabetes show a lower sensitivity to exercise-induced changes in EV-miRNA profile, mainly driven by miR-6873-3p, which could provide new insights into the alterations in exercise adaptation observed in type 2 diabetes.

**Development and replication of methylation risk scores for novel diabetes subtypes**

H. Lin, A.O.Y. Luk, W.-Y. So, J. Chan, R.C.W. Ma, TRANSCEND Consortium

**Background and aims:**
Recent studies have classified diabetes using “hard-clustering” into severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), mild age-related diabetes (MARD), mild diabetes with high HDL-cholesterol (MDH) and severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID). We have replicated these subtypes, as well as identify a novel subgroup, severe hyperglycaemic diabetes (SHD) with poor prognosis among Chinese adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. To explore the under- lying epigenetic mechanisms, this study aims to develop and validate subgroup-specific methylation risk scores (MRSs) for the seven dia- betes subgroups in the Chinese population and evaluate associations between these epigenetic signatures and diabetes-related complications.

**Materials and methods:**
589 individuals from the Hong Kong Diabe- tes Register (HKDR: 1995-2019) who underwent structured assessment were included with a median follow-up of 14.6 years. All participants (48.6% are male) were classified into diabetes subgroups using base- line data, with mean age of diagnosis 46.8 years, 9.3 years if diabetes duration, 25.5 kg/m2 BMI, 7.9% HbA1c, 1.3 mmol/L HDLC, and 22 are positive in anti-GAD. We used Illumina 450K array to analysis genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of leukocyte DNA collected at baseline. The cohort was randomly divided into a discovery set (70%, n=412) and a replication set (30%, n=177). In the discovery cohort, a two-stage approach was employed for developing subgroup-specific MRS. Subgroup-specific methylated CpG sites was identified using ANCOVA, adjusting for sex. Elastic-net regression was then imple- mented for selection and model optimization to derive subgroup- specific MRS models. ROC curves were generated and multivariable- adjusted Cox proportional regression were performed.

**Results:**
We identified seven MRSs, one for each subtype with each MRS associated with different patterns of complications during follow- up. Compared with MRSs, SIDD-MRS was associated with lower risks of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage kidney disease (ESKD), and all-cause mortality; SHD-MRS was associated with higher risk of CKD, ESKD and all-cause mortality; MHD-MRS was negatively associated with risk of CKD; MOD-MRS was associated with increased risk of congestive heart failure and SAID-MRS was associated with increased risk of peripheral vascular disease. These associations were significant after adjusted for FDR. Using only 5 CpGs, the SHD-MRS achieved the highest predictive accuracy (AUC 0.79 in discovery, 0.77 in replication).

**Conclusion:**
We developed a comprehensive panel of MRSs associ- ated with seven diabetes subtypes. The associations of these distinctive epigenetic signatures with various outcomes may have clinical utility for disease subtyping and risk stratification, especially in identifying the SHD-MRS subgroup.

**Background and aims:**
The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has recommended bariatric surgery (BS) as an effective strategy for the management and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in individu- als with a BMI over 35 kg/m². However, not all patients with morbid obesity (MO) (≥40 kg/m²) achieve remission after surgery. Identifying in advance which patients will respond favorably to this procedure would help avoid unnessary invasive interventions and improve clini- cal decision-making. Aim: To study and evaluate different biochemical and anthropometric variables, along with various miRNAs, and com- bine them to develop a predictive algorithm capable of identifying MO patients with T2DM who will achieve diabetes remission after surgery.

**Materials and methods:**
Our group conducted a preliminary selection of miRNAs associated with T2D remission after BS using a miRNA expression panel in a small cross-sectional study. The selected miR- NAs were then analyzed in a prospective study involving 33 subjects with obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m²) and T2D, divided into two groups: 23 subjects who experienced T2D remission (OM-R) and 10 subjects who did not (OM-NoR) one year after BS. Various biochemical and anthro- pometric variables were measured. Total miRNAs were extracted from serum samples using automated methods, and the expression of miR- 590-5p was specifically analyzed by real-time PCR (copy numbers) to determine its value as a predictive biomarker. Diagnostic efficacy analyses were performed by combining different variables through logistic regression and ROC curves, selecting the algorithm with the highest prognostic efficacy.

**Results:**
We observed significant differences ( = 0.031) in miR- 590-5p levels between both groups, with higher levels in the OM-R group (1189.4 ± 277.36) compared to the OM-NoR group (365.3 ± 143.6).Different ROC curves were performed to compare the prognos- tic ability of miR-590-5p alone and in combination with other variables to discriminate between OM-R and OM-NoR subjects. The AUC for miR-590-5p alone was 0.79, while BMI and fasting glucose had AUCs of 0.82 and 0.85, respectively.The combination of miR-590-5p with BMI and fasting glucose significantly improved the predictive capacity of the model, achieving the highest prognostic accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90.

**Conclusion:**
The combination of BMI, fasting glucose, and serum miR-590-5p levels allows for the construction of an algorithm with a 90% prognostic capacity to identify individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes who respond favorably to bariatric surgery for diabetes remission.Our study demonstrates that the combination of different biomarkers could have outstanding potential for use in clinical practice, helping to avoid interventions in patients who are unlikely to achieve the expected outcome.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is a growing global health concern, affecting 9-25% of pregnancies. Cur- rent diagnostic tools, such as the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), are typically employed late in the second trimester, potentially delay- ing early intervention. This systematic review aims to evaluate the diagnostic utility of placenta-derived novel serum biomarkers for the early prediction of GDM.

**Materials and methods:**
A comprehensive literature search was con- ducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases for studies published between 2010 and 2024 that investigated serum levels of placenta-associated biomarkers in early to mid-pregnancy in relation to later GDM diagnosis. The review followed PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria included human studies reporting on biomarkers such as apelin, ficolin-3, GDF-15, visfatin, omentin-1, and SCUBE-1. Data extraction focused on biomarker levels, gestational age at measurement, GDM diagnostic criteria, and statistical significance.

**Results:**
Out of 237 initially identified records, 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. Apelin and GDF-15 were consistently elevated in GDM cases during the first and second trimesters. Omentin-1 lev- els were significantly reduced in early pregnancy and demonstrated a strong inverse correlation with insulin resistance. Ficolin-3 and SCUBE-1 levels were increased in some studies, indicating poten- tial roles in placental inflammation and vascular stress, respectively. Visfatin results were variable. No single biomarker showed adequate diagnostic performance alone, but combining apelin and omentin-1 improved predictive accuracy in multivariate models (AUC: 0.82-0.91 in select cohorts).

**Conclusion:**
Placenta-derived serum biomarkers, particularly apelin, GDF-15, and omentin-1, show promising potential for early detection of GDM. Their integration into first-trimester screening protocols could enhance diagnostic timing and improve maternal-fetal outcomes. How- ever, further validation through large-scale, multicenter studies is nec- essary to establish their clinical utility.

**Background and aims:**
While regular physical activity is a success- ful intervention for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. There is a complex interplay between DNA methylation and cellular metabolism which contributes to exercise-induced alterations to the methylation status of a cell. This study aims to identify whether exercise induced alterations to DNA methylation are associated with changes in metabo- lomic profiles in the skeletal muscle.

**Materials and methods:**
Women with type 2 diabetes (N= 20) or nor- mal glucose tolerance (N= 14) completed 35 min exercise on a cycler ergometer at 85 % maximal heart rate. muscle biopsies were collected before (pre), immediately (post) and 3 hr after exercise (recovery). Transcriptome arrays, methylation arrays and broad range metabolomic analysis was performed on skeletal muscle samples.

**Results:**
Women with type 2 diabetes had a quantitively greater number of differentially methylated CpG sites and regions at recovery compared to baseline compared to women with normal glucose tolerance (Type 2 diabetes; CpG sites: n = 47,804, regions: n = 3,143). Consistent with this finding, exercise increased the ratio of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH):S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (p= 0.018) in women with type 2 diabetes at recovery compared to baseline, underscored by an increase in SAH (adj.p = 0.003), not SAM. Metabolomic analysis identified an increase in several metabolites involved in methionine metabolism in women with type 2 diabetes at recovery compared to baseline, includ- ing; methionine (adj.p= 0.047), cysteine (adj.p= 0.002) and hypo- taurine (adj.p= 0.026). Exercise regulated the mRNA expression of several key genes regulating methionine metabolism in both diagnosis groups, with a reduction in and an increase in observed. In women with type 2 diabetes, a unique increase in expres- sion and reduction in were detected. Pearsons correlation analysis identified an association between exercise-induced changes in differentially methylated CpG sites and metabolites annotated to the methionine, cysteine, SAM, and taurine metabolism pathway in both diagnosis groups. However, these changes were quantitatively greater in women with type 2 diabetes at recovery compared to baseline (n cor- relations: cysteine = 2990, hypotaurine = 3009). Several amino acids (n correlations in each sub-pathway: tryptophan metabolism= 4611, leucine, isoleucine and valine metabolism= 3343) and lipids species (phosphatidylcholine= 3596, fatty acid metabolism (Acyl Carnitine, Hydroxyl)= 2905) showed the highest correlation with CpG methyla- tion in response to exercise in women with type 2 diabetes.

**Conclusion:**
These findings identify a greater CpG methylation response to acute exercise in women with type 2 diabetes. Exercise- induced alterations in methionine cycle metabolites, along with their association with global CpG methylation, suggest a diagnoses specific link between changes in methionine metabolism and DNA methylation in response to exercise in women with type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic islet (dys)function in type 2 dia- betes (T2D) is shaped by a complex interplay between genetics, age, and metabolic stressors such as lipo-glucotoxicity. Here, we sought to disentangle epigenetic determinants from genetic background in the regulation of β-cell function, and identify how age- and T2D-driven methylation changes contribute to disease development.

**Materials and methods:**
We profiled DNA methylome (EPIC array), transcriptome (RNA-seq), and genotypes (Omni2.5M array) from 144 pancreatic islet preparations from organ donors (age: 22-96 years; 21 with T2D). Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) were con- ducted for age and T2D separately. We developed an integrative frame- work linking CpGs to gene expression within 2 Mb, while accounting for nearby genetic variants. Functional relevance was assessed via donor islets insulin stimulation index (ISI). Methylation risk score (MRS) derived from CpGs also detected in blood was developed for T2D prediction.

**Results:**
We identified 1,092 age- and 1,073 T2D-associated CpGs with only 3 shared sites. Most age CpGs were hypermethylated in pro- moters; T2D CpGs were hypomethylated in enhancers. Integration with gene expression data, while accounting for nearby genetic variation, uncovered 293 age-regulated and 387 T2D-regulated genes, revealing epigenetic effects that would have been masked by genetic confound- ing. Only 4.5% of CpGs influenced their nearest gene. Age and T2D CpG genes independently converged on key β-cell processes: aging affects genes involved in hormone production and release, including both maladaptive repression (e.g., encoding a potassium chan- nel, a δ-opioid receptor, a glycine receptor) and adap- tive upregulation (e.g., ). In contrast, T2D predominantly triggered adaptive responses, including upregulation of hormone production and secretion genes (somatostatin), (prohormone convertase), and (synaptotagmin 7), potentially reflecting compensatory responses to metabolic stress. , a non-coding islet-specific transcript, was a shared target in both. These effects were largely inde- pendent of genetic variation. Finally, the age-based MRS significantly improves T2D prediction when added to polygenic risk scores (AUC: PRS=0.76; PRS+MRS=0.86).

**Conclusion:**
We reveal distinct, non-genetic age- and T2D-driven methylome patterns in human islets that shape β-cell function via adap- tive and maladaptive gene regulation. These findings support the value of integrating genetics and epigenetics to reveal the complementarity of β-cell regulatory programs triggered by aging and metabolic stress in diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Type 3c diabetes mellitus, particularly its core subtype post-acute pancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PPDM-A), faces dual challenges of poorly characterized pathophysiology and diagnostic ambiguity. This study employs untargeted metabolomics to delineate the metabolic characteristics of PPDM-A and identify discriminative biomarkers against common diabetes subtypes, aiming to elucidate disease mechanisms and advance precision diagnostics.

**Materials and methods:**
We enrolled 194 participants from Octo- ber 2022 to October 2024, including PPDM-A (n=30), healthy con- trols (n=47), acute pancreatitis (AP, n=42), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM, n=35), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, n=40). Serum metabolomic profiling was conducted using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Multi- variate and univariate models were used to analyze the differential metabolites in PPDM-A, and the characteristics of the disease were analyzed in combination with metabolic pathway analysis. LASSO regression and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analy- ses were implemented to construct diagnostic models distinguishing PPDM-A from other diabetes subtypes.

**Results:**
A total of 839 metabolites were identified. PPDM-A exhib- ited distinct lipidomic dysregulation, particularly glycerophospholip- ids, with 112 and 56 differentially expressed metabolites identified versus healthy controls and AP group, respectively. Three conserved glycerophospholipid derivatives emerged as core biomarkers across all comparisons. Pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid signaling, and oxida- tive stress pathways. Diagnostic modeling identified 82 metabolites distinguishing PPDM-A from T1DM. Lipid metabolites dominated this signature, accounting for 71.95%. After LASSO regression, two lipid species exhibited exceptional discriminative power (AUC >0.9), including oleoyl-linoleoyl-glycerol (18:1/18:2) [2] ,1-palmitoyl- 2-dihomo-linolenoyl-GPC (16:0/20:3n3). Thirty different metabo- lites were screened for PPDM-A and T2DM. LASSO regression and ROC analysis revealed moderate diagnostic performance (AUC range: 0.532-0.806). To enhance discriminative power, three glycerophospho- lipid derivatives—1-oleoylglycerol (18:1), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-GPE (16:0/18:1), 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-GPE (18:0/18:1) were combined with dihydroorotate and 4-methoxyphenol sulfate in a logistic regression model. The composite biomarker panel achieved an AUC of 0.869 (95% CI: 0.784-0.954).The difference pathway between PPDM-A and common types of diabetes involves glycerophospholipid metabolism, linoleic acid remodeling, and taurine metabolism implicated dual exo- crine-endocrine injury and inflammatory pathogenesis.

**Conclusion:**
PPDM-A is characterized by glycerophospholipid dysho- meostasis coupled with oxidative stress and pancreatic exocrine-endo- crine crosstalk disruption. The combination of differential diagnosis markers of PPDM-A and common types of diabetes based on metabo- lomics showed high differential efficacy, providing a new strategy for precision classification. These findings provide a theoretical basis for further understanding the pathogenesis of PPDM-A and developing potential differential diagnostic markers.

**Background and aims:**
As a home-based alternative to serum C-peptide, urinary C-peptide (UCP) shows potential for assessing key features of diabetes, including insulin secretion and sensitivity, in decentralized studies. We aimed to: (i) assess UCP stability over time, (ii) evaluate its predictive performance for HOMA2 indices of insulin resistance and beta-cell function (HOMA2-IR and HOMA2-B), and (iii) investigate its potential for identifying type 2 diabetes (T2D) subtypes.

**Materials and methods:**
A subset from the German Diabetes Study (GDS) was analyzed, including participants with T2D (type 1 diabetes- related antibody-absent) or normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Morning urine stored at -20°C was analyzed for C-peptide and creatinine con- centrations. UCP stability was evaluated using regression and Spear- man analyses. Mixed models were used to predict serum C-peptide from UCP, adjusting for age at diagnosis, sex, and BMI. HOMA2-indi- ces were calculated from measured serum C-peptide ­(HOMA2 ) and predicted serum C-peptide ­(HOMA2 ). T2D subtypes were assigned via hard clustering, as previously described by Ahlqvist et al., using measured and UCP-predicted serum C-peptide. Data were split 80:20 into training/testing sets and concordance between ­HOMA2 - and ­HOMA2 -derived subtypes was evaluated.

**Results:**
The study included 488 T2D [age: 53 (IQR: 45-60) years, 35% female, BMI: 30 (IQR: 26-34) kg/m²] and 192 NGT participants [age: 47 (IQR: 30-56) years, 38% female, BMI: 26 (IQR: 24-29) kg/ m²]. UCP levels remained stable at -20°C, with no decline over 15 years (R=0.04; p=0.19). ­HOMA2 indices associated strongly with ­HOMA2 (HOMA2-IR: R=0.81, p<0.001; HOMA2-B: R=0.83, p<0.001). Predicted serum C-peptide-based cluster assignment achieved 79% (95% CI: 68-87%, κ=0.64, p<0.001) accuracy compared to serum C-peptide-derived T2D-subtypes. Likelihood-ratio testing showed that adding known diabetes duration (p=0.65), antihyperten- sive medication (p=0.06), or insulin/metformin medication (p=0.81) did not improve model performance.

**Conclusion:**
UCP is a stable, non-invasive alternative to serum C-pep- tide, suitable for decentralized studies and effective even after long- term sample storage. It yields comparable results to serum C-peptide in predicting HOMA2-indices and T2D subtypes, highlighting its poten- tial for broader applications in precision medicine.

**Identification of pyroptosis-related molecular markers in diabetes of the exocrine pancreas**

G. Li

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (DEP) is a form of diabetes secondary to pancreatic exocrine disorders, most com- monly caused by acute/chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory states play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of DEP. Pyroptosis, a novel programmed cell death modality characterized by pro-inflammatory immune responses, has recently garnered significant attention. Sup- pressing inflammatory cytokine expression and modulating pyroptosis- related signaling pathways may represent novel therapeutic strategies for DEP. This study aimed to identify pyroptosis-related molecular markers in DEP.

**Materials and methods:**
The GPL570 dataset GSE76896, comprising 20 DEP patients and 32 controls, was downloaded from the GEO data- base. Using the "limma" package in R software, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened with thresholds of adj.P.Val < 0.05 and |log2FC| ≥ 0.5, designated as the S1 gene set. A pyroptosis-related gene set (105 genes) was obtained from the GeneCards database. The intersection of S1 and pyroptosis-related genes was defined as the S2 gene set. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed on both S1 and S2 gene sets. Additionally, the immune microenvironment of pancreatic islets in DEP was analyzed using the CIBERSORT algorithm.

**Results:**
Differential expression analysis identified 1,129 DEGs. GO enrichment analysis revealed significant associations of these genes with inflammatory responses, lymphocyte activation, and immune reg- ulation. KEGG pathway analysis highlighted enrichment in cytokine- cytokine receptor interactions, protein digestion, and absorption pathways. The intersection analysis identified 12 pyroptosis-related genes (TREM1, EPHA2, TXNIP, ADORA3, CASP1, ADORA2B, IFI16, TREM2, PRDM1, GZMB, PRF1, CASP4), all significantly upregulated in DEP compared to controls. KEGG analysis indicated enrichment of these genes in the NOD-like receptor signaling path- way. CIBERSORT analysis demonstrated elevated infiltration of M1 macrophages, memory B cells, and eosinophils, alongside reduced fol- licular helper T cells and activated natural killer cells in DEP islets.

**Conclusion:**
This study identified 12 pyroptosis-related genes poten- tially involved in DEP pathogenesis and underscored the critical role of immune dysregulation in pyroptosis-driven inflammation. These findings provide novel insights into DEP mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

**Background and aims:**
Accurate diagnosis of young-onset type 2 dia- betes (YOT2D) is crucial given its high lifetime risk of cardiorenal dis- ease, to ensure early treatment with prognostic medications. However, distinguishing YOT2D from young-onset type 1 diabetes (YOT1D) at presentation is challenging, particularly in cases with negative islet antibodies, leading to misclassification and suboptimal therapy. While C-peptide can improve diagnostic accuracy, this test is performed if uncertainty remains after 3 years from diagnosis. We examined the utility of C-peptide for early identification of YOT2D within 3 years of diagnosis.

**Materials and methods:**
Clinically confirmed YOT1D and YOT2D, aged below 40 years, in whom islet antibodies (GAD, ZnT8, IA-2) and non-fasting C-peptide tests had been measured within 3 years of diagnosis between 2012-2025, were identified from electronic patient records. YOT1D was diagnosed by antibody positivity. YOT2D was defined by negative antibody status. Data were collected for clinical characteristics, HbA1c at diagnosis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at presentation and C-peptide with contemporaneous plasma glucose. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessed the ability of age, BMI and C-peptide to identify YOT2D. Positive predictive values (PPV) of C-peptide levels for YOT1D and YOT2D were analysed.

**Results:**
There were 104 and 182 people diagnosed with YOT1D and YOT2D, respectively. Compared to YOT1D, the YOT2D cohort was older (median age 30 vs 27 years, p=0.003), had higher BMI (35.0±9.8 vs 26.4±6.8 kg/m , p<0.005), lower HbA1c at diagnosis (91±28 vs 103±30 mmol/mol, p=0.003), greater proportion of non-White ethnic- ity (46.7 vs 20.2%, p<0.005), lower DKA rate (6.0 vs 19.2%, p=0.001) and associated autoimmune disease (3.8 vs 15.4%, p=0.001). Obesity was present in 33.7% of YOT1D cases (mean BMI 34.2±4.6 kg/m²), while 31.3% of YOT2D cohort was on insulin therapy. Median times for measurement of islet antibodies after diagnosis for YOT1D and YOT2D were 0 and 0.25 months, respectively. The median time from diagnosis to C-peptide testing was 0 months for YOT1D and 2 months for YOT2D. YOT2D had higher C-peptide than YOT1D (median 1477 vs 504 pmol/L, p<0.005) with mean plasma glucose 12-16 mmol/L. In YOT2D, C-peptide was higher in those with White ethnicity (median 1645 vs 1333 pmol/L for non-White, p=0.02) who had higher BMI (37.8±10.7 vs 31.8±7.3 kg/m for non-White, p<0.005), but no ethnic difference in YOT1D was observed (White vs non-White; median 501 vs 503 pmol/L, p=NS). Irrespective of ethnicity, YOT2D had higher C-peptide than YOT1D (p<0.005). Obese YOT1D had lower C-peptide than YOT2D (median 867 vs 1477 pmol/L, p<0.005). Compared to YOT1D, insulin-treated YOT2D had higher C-peptide (median 1212 vs 504 pmol/L, p<0.005) and BMI (35.5±9.5 vs 26.5±6.8 kg/m , p<0.005). YOT2D treated with non-insulin therapies had higher C-pep- tide than those treated with insulin (median 1572 vs 1205 pmol/L, p=0.04). The highest area under the curve in ROC analysis was for C-peptide followed by BMI and age (0.88, 0.78 and 0.61, respectively). The PPV for YOT2D at C-peptide levels >800 and >1000 pmol/L were 82.1% and 85.8%, respectively. For YOT1D, the PPV at C-peptide levels <400 and <600 pmol/L were 100% and 90.6%, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
C-peptide is a useful adjunctive test to accurately diag- nose YOT2D in those with negative islet antibodies within 3 years of diagnosis.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes is commonly classified into T1DM and T2DM, but this classification offers limited insights into underlying mechanisms and heterogeneity within these types. Recently, a variety of novel diabetic patient subgroups have been identified, using clus- ter analysis approach. We aim to systematically review the subgroups and summarize patient characteristics within each subgroup via meta- analysis, thus to provide more reliable subgroup definitions.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed a systematic search in Pub- med, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus to identify primary studies on the cluster analysis based diabetes subgroups between 1st January 2017 and 15th February 2023. References cited by included studies will be taken into account to identify publications before 2017 and potential missing literature which cannot be identified by our search strategy. All literatures were screened independently by two authors. Data extrac- tion was conducted by one author and checked by another, using a pre-defined form. Radar chart was used to summarize the distribution of cluster variables. Random effect meta-analyses were performed for the mean of clustering variables in each subgroup.

**Results:**
Among 8048 studies identified, 116 studies were included. Fifty-two including 44 replication (44/51) and validation (15/51) stud- ies, and sixty-four studies proposed other new cluster definitions. Rep- lication studies mapped other replicable novel clusters labelled with “insulin resistant obese diabetes (IROD)”, “combined insulin resist- ant and deficient diabetes (CIRDD)” in Asian Indian, “mild diabe- tes (MD)” and “mild diabetes with high HDL-cholesterol (MDH)” in Scania (ANDIS) clusters. Radar charts presented gaps of five patient characteristics (age at diagnosis, BMI, HbA1c, HOMA2-B, HOMA-IR) between studies in same levels, and substantial differences existed in age at diagnosis, BMI and HOMA2-β. Random effects model indicated heterogeneity of studies. The summary means for “age at diagnosis” in each subgroup are: SAID 44.0, SIDD 48.3, SIRD 55.3, MARD 57.5 and MOD 46.2; for “BMI” are: SAID 25.4, SIDD 27.4, SIRD 31.5, MARD 26.2, MOD 32.5; for “HbA1c (%)” are: SAID 8.53, SIDD 10.3, SIRD 7.3, MARD 7.0, MOD 7.5; for “HOMA2-β” are: SAID 37.4, SIDD 32.5, SIRD 136.1, MARD 66.3, MOD 72.7; for “HOMA2-β” are: SAID 1.5; SIDD 2.0; SIRD 4.7, respectively. Over 98% variability of each study could be attributed to between-study heterogeneity rather than random error (p < 0.01). In both the common effect model and the random effects model, significant differences (p < 0.05) between levels existed frequently in SAID and SIDD clusters.

**Conclusion:**
This study provided an overview of recent studies focusing on diabetes subgroups using cluster analysis. The data-driven cluster analysis of six variables is the cornerstone of various follow-up studies. We found instable outcomes including cluster composition, variable centroid in studies inspired by this strategy. More evidence and evidence synthesis are needed to achieve more reliable subgroups definitions.

**Background and aims:**
Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a dermatologi- cal marker of insulin resistance that is closely associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The distribution pattern of AN across various metabolic states, including normal glucose tolerance, IR, prediabetes, and T2D, remains poorly understood. Its predictive efficacy for prediabetes risk stratification has not been validated in large-scale clinical studies. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between AN and metabolic disease progression and to evaluate its potential for T2D risk stratification.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study included 1,158 adults screened for AN from 2010 to 2021. Participants were cate- gorized into IR stages using HOMA-IR and fasting plasma glucose thresholds: normal insulin and glucose homeostasis (NINB), subclini- cal IR (SIR), overt IR (OIR), prediabetes with IR (PreDM-IR), and diabetes with IR (DM-IR). Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between AN and IR stages. Subgroup analyses were based on age, sex, BMI, family history of diabetes/obesity, and systolic blood pressure. Mediation analysis quantified the contributions of waist circumference, ALT level, and uric acid level to the AN-OIR relationship. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the incremental predictive utility of AN.

**Results:**
AN prevalence was highest in the OIR stage (71.3% vs. 44.6% in the DM-IR stage, p<0.001). AN-positive individuals exhibited younger age (27.8±9.1 vs. 37.2±13.1 years), higher BMI (38.0±6.9 vs. 33.8±5.5 kg/m²), and more severe IR (HOMA-IR 9.9±8.7 vs. 7.9±12.1, all p<0.001). The odds ratio for OIR in AN-positive subjects was strongest across models (Model 1: OR=5.57, 95% CI 3.06-10.16; Model 3: OR=4.69, 95% CI 1.58-13.95), exceeding associations with PreDM-IR (OR=2.40) and DM-IR (OR=1.80). Subgroup analyses high- lighted elevated risks in patients with OIR aged <35 years (OR=2.15, p=0.008) and those with BMI ≥35 kg/m² (OR=1.89, p=0.003). Incor- porating AN into an age-and sex-based model improved the prediction of metabolic dysfunction (AUC=0.776 vs. 0.730, p<0.001). Mediation analysis revealed central obesity as the primary mediator (25.3%), fol- lowed by uric acid (20.8%), and ALT (14.1%).

**Conclusion:**
AN as a visual biomarker showed excellent early OIR screening values in young and severely obese populations. AN reflects profound metabolic disorders such as β-cell dysfunction and provides predictive efficacy beyond traditional indicators. In clinical practice, AN screening improves the early identification of high-risk groups and slows β-cell function deterioration through targeted interventions, reducing the risk of diabetes progression.

**Background and aims:**
In people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), maintain- ing good glycaemic control is paramount in minimizing risk of devel- oping long-term diabetes-related complications. We hypothesized that HbA1c trajectories can differ among children and young people (CYP) with T2D in multi-ethnic Singapore. The aim of this study is to iden- tify HbA1c trajectories among Singaporean CYP with T2D, and their associated factors.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of CYP diagnosed with T2D and treated at our children’s hospital in Singapore. Patients with autoimmue-mediated and maturity-onset diabetes of the young were excluded. Data were collated from clinical records. Group-based trajectory modelling was performed to identify trajectories of HbA1c from diagnosis through up to 7 years of follow- up. Multivariable regression was used to determine whether ethnicity, sex, age, BMI z-score or insulin therapy at diagnosis were associated with the identified HbA1c trajectories.

**Results:**
We included 138 CYP (47% male; 61% Chinese, 24% Malay, 13% Indian, 2% others) diagnosed with T2D at mean (SD) age 13.8 (2.2) years and followed up for median (IQR) 3.5 (2.5- 5.0) years. At diagnosis, mean HbA1c (SD) was 10.1 (2.9) % [87 (32) mmol/mol] and mean BMI z-score (SD) was 1.64 (0.70). Four HbA1c trajectories were identified (see Figure): Group 1 has mean HbA1c dipping to 6% [42 mmol/mol] at year 3 before rebounding; Group 2 has mean HbA1c progressively rising from the initial 7.8% [62 mmol/mol]; Group 3 has mean HbA1c progressively rising from the initial 9.1% [76 mmol/mol]; and Group 4 has mean HbA1c ris- ing from the initial 10.5% [91 mmol/mol] in the first 4 years before dipping down. Compared to Chinese, Indian CYP (adjusted odds- ratio, OR (95%-CI), 2.78 (1.07, 7.18); p=0.04) or Malay CYP (OR 2.64 (1.23, 5.70); p=0.01) were more likely to be in a higher HbA1c trajectory group (3 or 4). Insulin therapy (OR 3.69 (1.84, 7.43); p<0.001) was more likely to be started at diagnosis for CYP in Group 3 or 4. CYP’s sex (reference = female: OR 0.57 (0.30, 1.09); p=0.09;) or age (OR 0.98 (0.85, 1.14); p=0.81) and BMI z-score (OR 0.79 (0.48, 1.29); p=0.34) at diagnosis were not associated with the identified HbA1c trajectories.

**Conclusion:**
We identified 4 non-overlapping HbA1c trajectories during the first 7 years of follow-up from diagnosis in a cohort of CYP with T2D in Singapore, for which Indian or Malay ethnic- ity and treatment with insulin at diagnosis were independent fac- tors, but not sex, age, and BMI at diagnosis. These observations could guide clinicians on the treatment strategies to optimize the glycaemic trajectories for young-onset T2D during childhood and adolescence.

**Plasma small RNA profiling reveals a predictive three-miRNA signature for early beta cell dysfunction across glucose tolerance stages**

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease due to multiple pathogenic mechanisms including progressive β-cell dysfunction, for which no reliable circulating biomarkers currently exist. Given their regulatory role in β-cell function, miRNAs may serve as promising non-invasive indicators. This study aimed to identify plasma miRNA signatures associated with in vivo β-cell dysfunction in metabolically characterized individuals.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed two independent cohorts: a discovery cohort (n=78; 23 NGT, 22 IGT, 33 T2D) undergoing OGTT and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and a validation cohort (n=159; 71 ND, 88 T2D) assessed with MMT. In both cohorts, β-cell Glucose Sensitivity (GS, the slope of the insulin secretion rate vs glu- cose relationship) and Rate Sensitivity (RS, a marker of early insulin secretion) were assessed, using a mathematical model, by C-peptide deconvolution. RNA was extracted from plasma samples, small RNA Sequencing was performed and data analysed using sRNAbench. Dif- ferential Expression Analysis (DE) among glucose tolerance groups (padj<0.05) was performed using DESeq2. Linear Regression was carried out between miRNAs and metabolic/clinical data (p<0.01). Technical validation was performed through droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)(p<0.05). Then, we employed LASSO linear regression for features selection (miRNAs expression and clinical/metabolic data) and prediction of RS.

**Results:**
Small RNA sequencing on plasma samples from the discov- ery cohort identified 11 DE miRNAs. Specific miRNAs showed sig- nificant correlations with β-cell function parameters (e.g., GS, RS), with distinct patterns of association. ddPCR was performed on highly expressed miRNAs DE and/or associated with β-cell function (e.g., GS, RS). We confirmed miR-34a-5p upregulation in T2D compared to IGT/NGT. Linear regression on ddPCR data highlighted a three- miRNA signature (miR-34a-5p, miR-1306-5p, miR-335) significantly associated to RS, a marker of early insulin secretion defects. LASSO regression showed that this signature, together with age and 1-h glyce- mia, was also able to predict RS ­(R =0.26;p<0.05). We also validated the ability of the model to predict RS in an enlarged cohorts of ND/ T2D subjects ­(R =0.07;p<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
A three-miRNA plasma signature (miR-34a-5p, miR- 1306-5p, miR-335) is strongly associated with early β-cell dysfunction and predicts Rate Sensitivity when combined with clinical parameters. This minimally invasive biomarker panel may improve early detection and monitoring of β-cell decline across glucose tolerance stages.

**Background and aims:**
To investigate the dose-response relationship between the postload-fasting gap, calculated from the oral glucose tol- erance test, and the risk of incident diabetes and prediabetes, as well as the potential for disease progression or reversal in a large Chinese cohort.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed data from the SENSIBLE- cohort study, selecting 3,094 participants for this analysis. These participants underwent oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and were followed up for an average of 3.24 years. The postload-fasting gap was calculated as the 2-hour postload plasma glucose (2hPG) minus fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Participants were classified into quintiles based on their postload-fasting gap values. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to model the association between postload-fasting gap and incident diabetes, incident prediabetes, disease progression from prediabetes to diabetes, and disease reversal from prediabetes to normal glucose tolerance (NGT). The Receiver Operating Characteris- tic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to determine optimal cutoff values for predicting different outcomes.

**Results:**
Participants with a higher postload-fasting gap tended to have higher BMI, blood pressure, and HbA1c levels (all p<0.001). Higher postload-fasting gap levels were strongly associated with an increased risk of diabetes, prediabetes, and disease progression. In contrast, those with lower postload-fasting gap values were more likely to revert from prediabetes to NGT. Optimal cutoff values were identi- fied for predicting increased risk: incident diabetes at >4.175 mmol/L (AUC = 0.851, 95% CI: 0.796-0.907), incident prediabetes at >2.175 mmol/L (AUC = 0.843, 95% CI: 0.828-0.858), disease progression at >4.245 mmol/L (AUC = 0.911, 95% CI: 0.886-0.936), and disease reversal at ≤2.265 mmol/L (AUC = 0.842, 95% CI: 0.830-0.854). RCS-GEE analysis further revealed nonlinear U-shaped relationships between postload-fasting gap and incident diabetes, incident predia- betes, disease progression, while disease reversal showed a monotoni- cally decreasing trend.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings support the potential use of the postload- fasting gap as a clinical biomarker by identifying optimal cut-off val- ues for incident diabetes, prediabetes, disease progression, and disease reversal. The observed U-shaped nonlinear relationship also highlights the importance of maintaining a postload-fasting gap in a smaller range to minimize metabolic risk. The postload-fasting gap can be a valuable tool for risk stratification and targeted diabetes prevention strategies.

4. Liechtenstein, Triesen, Liechtenstein, Medical Central Laboratories,

**Background and aims:**
The visceral adiposity Index (VAI) is a reliable biomarker of insulin resistance and is associated with the metabolic syndrome as well as with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Its power to predict the development of T2DM in patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) is unclear and is addressed in the present study.

**Materials and methods:**
We prospectively recorded incident diabetes over 8 years in 918 consecutive non-diabetic Caucasian patients with angiographically proven CAD. Diabetes was diagnosed according to ADA criteria. Prediabetes was identified based on the following param- eters: HbA1c levels ranging from 5.7% to 6.4%, fasting plasma glu- cose concentrations between 100 and 125 mg/dL, or a 2-hour post-oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose concentration between 140 and 199 mg/dL.

**Results:**
At baseline, 63.7% of our non-diabetic CAD patients had prediabetes; the VAI was significantly higher in patients with than in those without prediabetes (1.8±1.4 vs. 2.2±2.3 mg/dl; p=0.017). Dur- ing follow-up, diabetes was newly diagnosed in 144 patients, i.e. in 15.7% of the study population. The VAI predicted incident diabetes both univariately (OR 1.36 [1.14-1.62]; p<0.001) and after multivari- ate adjustment including baseline prediabetes (OR 1.19 [1.01-1.40]; p=0.038).

**Conclusion:**
We conclude that the incidence of diabetes is high in patients with established CAD and that the VAI strongly and indepen- dently predicts the development of diabetes in this population.

**Background and aims:**
Early identification of biomarkers predicting accelerated progression from normal glucose metabolism to predia- betes remains challenging among overweight and obese individuals. This study aimed to analyze continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data in this population to identify potential predictive markers for the progression to prediabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
CGM time-series data were collected over 14 days using the Libre ProIQ device (Abbott) from 60 adults enrolled in the PRAESIIDIUM study. Participants met inclusion criteria of normal glucose metabolism (fasting glucose <5.6 mmol/l, HbA1c <5.7%) and body mass index between 25-34.9 kg/m². Time-series glucose data were segmented into 24-hour periods, resulting in 657 segments of 96 glucose measurements each. Segments underwent cluster analysis using the k-medoids algorithm with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as distance measure. Two clusters were determined optimal by average sil- houette width and Calinski-Harabasz index. Participants were classified into three groups based on cluster assignment consistency: two distinct groups with segments consistently assigned (≥75%) to one cluster, and an intermediate group with ambiguous assignments (25-75%).

**Results:**
Through clustering analysis, participants were stratified into three distinct groups: Group 1 (n = 23), Group 2 (n = 18), and Group 3 (n = 19). No significant differences were observed among groups regarding age, BMI, waist-to-height ratio, or smoking prevalence. C-peptide concentrations showed a trend across groups, with higher median values observed in Group 1 (Group 1: 1.99 [1.61-2.77] ng/ml, Group 2: 1.62 [1.28-1.83] ng/ml, Group 3: 1.69 [1.45-1.96] ng/ml; p = 0.077). Group 1 participants demonstrated the highest triglyceride concentrations (Group 1: 1.19 [0.99-1.47] mmol/l vs. Group 2: 1.06 [0.82-1.43] mmol/l and Group 3: 0.76 [0.66-0.88] mmol/l; p = 0.032) and lowest HDL cholesterol levels (Group 1: 1.26 [1.12-1.46] mmol/l vs. Group 2: 1.40 [1.22-1.46] mmol/l and Group 3: 1.44 [1.33-1.77] mmol/l; p = 0.032), consistent with increased insulin resistance. Addi- tionally, Group 1 exhibited the highest mean glucose levels (Group 1: 5.91 [5.78-6.05] mmol/l, Group 2: 5.53 [5.46-5.58] mmol/l, Group 3: 5.21 [5.05-5.32] mmol/l; p < 0.001) and spent a significantly greater percentage of time above the tight glucose target (>7.8 mmol/l) (Group 1: 2.05 [0.92-3.15]%, Group 2: 0.98 [0.63-1.46] %, Group 3: 0.00 [0.16-0.64] %; p < 0.001). Group 1 also had the lowest percentage of time within the tight glucose range (3.5-7.8 mmol/l) (Group 1: 98.0 [96.6-98.9] %, Group 2: 98.6 [96.8-99.3] %, Group 3: 98.9 [98.2-99.6] %; p = 0.090), further supporting increased insulin resistance in this group.

**Conclusion:**
Cluster analysis of CGM data provides valuable insights into distinct metabolic patterns indicative of insulin resistance and met- abolic syndrome among individuals with normal glucose metabolism.

3. Japan, Non-Profit Organization Kenkokeiei, Tokyo, Japan.

**Background and aims:**
East Asians are known to develop type 2 diabetes without a history of obesity. It is not clear whether triceps, subscapular, or abdominal skinfold thickness, as well as BMI or waist circumference (WC), are associated with type 2 diabetes risk in non-obese Japanese men.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 4,961 Japanese men aged 35-53 years without diabetes at baseline were followed for 6 years. Subscapu- lar, abdominal, and triceps skinfold thicknesses were measured in the standing position using an Eiken-type skinfold caliper. Type 2 diabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose level ≥126 mg/dL or use of glucose-lowering medication. We included each skinfold thickness, age, smoking habits (non-smokers, past smokers, and current smok- ers), daily alcohol consumption (non-drinkers, light drinkers, moderate drinkers, heavy drinkers), regular physical exercise (yes/no), and family history of diabetes (yes/no), and BMI or WC in multivariable models.

**Results:**
During the 6 years of follow-up, 405 men developed type 2 diabetes. Among the total subjects, in the multivariable models includ- ing BMI, subscapular and abdominal skinfold thicknesses were asso- ciated with type 2 diabetes risk, but triceps skinfold thickness was not. The multiple-adjusted odds ratios for the highest quartile of sub- scapular, abdominal, and triceps skinfold thicknesses were 2.68 (95% CI: 1.75-4.10), 2.31 (1.55-3.43), and 1.33 (0.94-1.88), respectively, compared with the lowest quintile. In all models, BMI was associ- ated with type 2 diabetes risk. The results of multivariable models including WC were similar to those of models including BMI. Among subjects with BMI <23 kg/m , all skinfold thicknesses, but not BMI or WC, were associated with type 2 diabetes risk in the multivariable model including BMI. The multiple-adjusted odds ratios for the highest quartile of subscapular, abdominal, and triceps skinfold thicknesses were 2.82 (95% CI 1.31-6.07), 3.17 (1.57-6.40), and 2.74 (1.44-5.23), respectively, compared with the lowest quartile. In the multivariable models including WC, the results did not change. In all models, neither BMI nor WC was associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Among subjects with BMI ≥23 kg/m , in the multivariable models including BMI, BMI and WC, as well as subscapular and abdominal skinfold thickness, were associated with type 2 diabetes risk, but triceps skinfold thickness was not. The multiple-adjusted odds ratios for the highest quartile of subscapular, abdominal, and triceps skinfold thicknesses were 11.79 (2.85-48.71), 1.90 (1.07-3.40), and 1.03 (0.67-1.58), respectively, com- pared with the lowest quartile. In all models, BMI was associated with type 2 diabetes risk. The results of multivariable models including WC were similar to those of models including BMI, except for abdominal skinfold thickness, which was also not significant.

**Conclusion:**
In non-obese Japanese men, subscapular, abdominal, and triceps skinfold thicknesses were associated with type 2 diabetes risk, but BMI and WC were not. In contrast, in those with a BMI of 23 kg/ m or greater, BMI, WC, and subscapular skinfold thickness were asso- ciated with type 2 diabetes risk, but triceps skinfold thickness was not.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus type 2 (diabetes) poses a significant burden on people living with HIV (PLWH) particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to develop a machine learn- ing predictive model for diabetes among adults living with HIV and hypertension in Botswana.

**Materials and methods:**
This study used baseline data from a hybrid type 2 cluster randomized controlled trial conducted across HIV clin- ics in 14 villages in Botswana, which enrolled, 4655 adults aged ≥ 18-years old living with HIV and hypertension. Data was analyzed using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical and t-test for con- tinuous variables, respectively. P-values less than 0.05 indicated sig- nificant differences between those with versus those without diabetes. To solve data imbalances, a majority weighted minority over-sampling technique (MWMOTE) was conducted. A binary mixed model forest was used to account for possible intra-cluster correlation in prediction. To avoid overfitting, our model was trained on 80 percent of the data and tested on the remaining 20 percent. To evaluate the performance of the model, the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity statistics were reported.

**Results:**
The prevalence of diabetes in the parent study was 2.9 % (138/4655). The most important variables for predicting diabetes among PLWH are pre-existing hypertension, being singe/divorced or widowed, increasing systolic and diastolic blood pressure and being employed. Our predictive model recorded an AUC of 73.4%, indicat- ing high model accuracy, with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 25.9%.

**Conclusion:**
Our model performed well in correctly classifying peo- ple with diabetes and could be leveraged to improve the process of cascading and integrating diabetes screening in HIV care programs where resources are limited. Further refinement of this model could help targeted screening and prevention of diabetes among PLWH and hypertension in Botswana.

**Lipid accumulation product as a predictor of type 2 diabetes: insights from Qatar Biobank**

A. Kerkadi

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a chronic meta- bolic disease influenced by genetic, environmental, and metabolic risk factors, affecting 16% of Qatar’s population. Additionally, metabolic syndrome impacts approximately 70% of the population. Identifying individuals at risk of progressing from normoglycemia or prediabetes to T2DM could enable targeted, individualized prevention strategies. This study evaluates the predictive value of the lipid accumulation product (LAP), a marker derived from waist circumference and triglyc- eride levels, in assessing diabetes risk in a Qatari population.

**Materials and methods:**
A case-control study was conducted using data from 2,512 individuals in the Qatar Biobank. The study included 1,172 diabetic patients and 1,340 non-diabetic but highly dysmetabolic individuals matched for age, sex, BMI, and the presence of hyperten- sion or hyperlipidemia. Among non-diabetics, 782 were normoglyce- mic, and 558 had prediabetes. First, we compared metabolic charac- teristics between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. We then stratified participants into LAP quartiles and analyzed diabetes prevalence and metabolic risk variations. Finally, we performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess LAP’s ability, alongside other metabolic risk factors, to distinguish between T2DM, normoglycemia, and prediabetes.

**Results:**
While participants in both groups were similar in terms of age, sex distribution, and metabolic risk factors due to case-control matching, patients with diabetes exhibited significantly higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (mean 8.1% vs. mean 5.6%, < 0.0001), higher inflammatory biomarkers (CRP: mean 7.8 vs. mean 6.8, = 0.01), and higher LAP (mean 61.7 vs. mean 33.4, < 0.0001). LAP quartile analysis revealed a significant increase in HbA1c across quartiles, with a higher prevalence of diabetes in the upper LAP quartiles ( < 0.0001). This trend correlated with increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and volume ( < 0.001). In the ROC analysis, LAP outperformed other metabolic risk markers, including BMI, waist circumference, and VAT, in distinguishing individuals with T2DM (AUC = 0.756). The optimal LAP cutoff point achieved a sensitivity of 73.21% and specificity of 64.7% when assessed alone. However, LAP was less effective in differ- entiating normoglycemia from prediabetes compared to other metabolic indicators (AUC = 0.6).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that LAP significantly differs between individuals with and without diabetes and serves as a reliable marker for distinguishing T2DM cases. Further longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate LAP’s predictive potential for diabetes risk in highly dysmetabolic populations, such as those in Qatar and the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Incorporat- ing LAP into clinical risk assessment could enhance individualized prevention strategies.

**A machine learning microRNA predictor for long-term remission following short-term intensive insulin therapy in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes**

S. Tang

**Background and aims:**
Short-term intensive insulin therapy (SIIT) effectively restores β-cell function and induces diabetes remission in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients(T2DM). However, approxi- mately 50% of the patients experience hyperglycemia relapse within 1 year, underscoring the need for reliable predictive biomarkers.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from the SIIT-alone groups of two inde- pendent randomized controlled trials involving all participants under- going SIIT at The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were used. Serum microRNA profiling was performed on 24 partici- pants (discovery set). Machine learning methods were applied for pre- dictive microRNA biomarker selection. The selected microRNAs were verified in an independent cohort (N=97). Subsequently, the cohort were randomly divided into training and validation sets at a 7:3 ratio. Three prediction models were developed and the performance was assessed. The potential miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms were investigated through enrichment analysis and transfection experiments.

**Results:**
Through small RNA sequencing of serum samples from a multicenter cohort (N = 24), we identified differentially expressed microRNAs before and after SIIT. By machine learning algorithms, we identified five hub microRNAs associated with 1-year glycemic remission, of which baseline hsa-miR-502-3p was rigorously validated in an independent clinical cohort (N = 97) by RT-qPCR. A combined predictive model was developed integrating baseline hsa-miR-502-3p levels and post-SIIT insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 (post-ISSI-2), demonstrating superior predictive accuracy [ROC-AUC of 0.837 (95% CI: 0.732-0.917)] versus clinical parameters alone [ROC-AUC of 0.769 (95% CI: 0.649-0.865)]. The model also exhibited excellent calibration and clinical utility compared to other models, evidenced by a lower Brier score of 0.160 (95% CI: 0.115-0.205) versus 0.196 (95% CI: 0.153-0.239) for post-ISSI-2 alone, and a higher net benefit across most risk thresholds. Molecular mechanism studies indicated that hsa-miR- 502-3p regulates β-cell electrophysiological stability through targeting sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1; ABCC8), a key regulatory of the ATP- sensitive potassium channel and glucose induced insulin secretion.

**Conclusion:**
Collectively, this clinical-mechanistic study establishes a novel microRNA-based prediction model for long-term SIIT response, while unveiling new biological insights into treatment response dynamics.

**A review of evidence level and causal support in prediction models of complications in health economic models of type 2 diabetes**

2. tralia, Department of Epidemiology, Maastricht University, Maas-

**Background and aims:**
Predicting the risk of complications is essen- tial for health economic (HE) simulation models of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Clinical prediction models, both existing ones and newly devel- oped ones, can serve as the risk equations to project changes in inci- dence of complications due to changes in risk factors. This implicitly requests the prediction models having a casual inference, which is usu- ally not met since most of them are factual prediction models. The aims of this review are: to evaluate the evidence level of prediction models used in HE models of T2D; to assess the causal support of risk factors used in the prediction models.

**Materials and methods:**
Prediction models were identified based on a previous review, which named prediction of complications in HE models of T2D. The level of evidence for each model was assessed using the framework adapted from Hill’s criteria, where the first three levels are considered relevant for HE modelling. We used a causation score containing 4 of the Hill’s criteria (strength, consistency, tempo- rality, and coherence) to assess the causal support of each risk factors included in the prediction models.

**Results:**
Twenty-one prediction models were included in the analysis. Fourteen (66.7%) of them are rated as Level 1 (lowest evidence), five (23.8%) are at Level 2, and only two (9.5%) models are at Level 3. There are 64 different risk factors used as predictors in those prediction models. Among these risk factors, 18 variables (Education, Smoking status, BMI, Physical activity, HbA1c, White blood cell count, Heart rate, DBP, SBP, Triglycerides, Total cholesterol, HDL, Non-HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, Total cholesterol/HDL ratio, Albumin, Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, eGFR) are ‘modifiable risk factors’ and were assessed for the causal support.

**Conclusion:**
The applicability of prediction models in HE models needs more consideration. The level of evidence is relatively low in prediction models used in T2D HE models. Intervening on risk factors and predicting based on modifiable risk factors may lead to incorrect incidence estimates when risk factors have less causal support.

**Background and aims:**
The number of people living with obesity and overweight is constantly rising, including those suffering from type 1 diabetes (T1D). Several American and European studies sug- gesting comparable prevalence of obesity and overweight in T1D as in nondiabetic population. Obesity not just accelerates ϐ-cell dysfunc- tion, but also causes insulin resistance, both of which subsequently increase insulin demands and worsen glycaemic control, not to mention contribute to the development of chronic diabetes complications and cardiovascular (CV) diseases.

**Materials and methods:**
Clinical and CGM data in the Czech national diabetes registry (DiaPanther), collected since 2022, were used to ana- lyse characteristics of 4105 adult individuals withT1D [46% female, 54% male, median age 43 years, median duration of T1D 20 years] in association with body-mass-index (BMI) level.

**Results:**
Among overall T1D cohort, 833 (20%) and 1506 (37%) had BMI in obesity and overweight range, respectively. These individuals were older (p<0.001), more often male (p<0.001), had longer duration of T1D (p<0.001) and achieved significantly worse glycaemic control in terms of higher average sensor glucose (p=0.008), % of time-above- range (p=0.004), time-below range (p<0.001) and HbA1c (p<0.001) in comparation with individuals with normal BMI. Patients with obe- sity and overweight also had more frequently hypertension (p<0.001), hyperlipidaemia (p<0.001) and microvascular complications, such as neuropathy (p<0.001), retinopathy (p<0.001) and diabetic foot syn- drome (p=0.003). The difference between patients on insulin pens and pumps were not statistically significant.

**Conclusion:**
Overweight and obesity occurred in more than half of adult individuals with T1D and were associated with poorer glycaemic control and more frequent presence of CV risk factors and chronic microvascular complications.

7. Nordovest, Italy, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.

**Background and aims:**
Thanks to the efforts made in the last cen- tury, aging with type 1 diabetes is no longer a privilege. More and more patients with T1DM are reaching and surpassing the age of 75, however, data on their clinical characteristics, prevalence of diabetes complications and quality of care are lacking.

**Materials and methods:**
This multicenter, observational, retrospec- tive study includes data of patients with T1DM aged over 75 years, regularly evaluated until 2023 in 296 Diabetes Clinics in Italy included in the AMD Annals Initiative. Socio-demographic characteristics, indi- cators of quality of care, data on glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure control, data on the current insulin therapy regimen, the use of insulin pumps, as well as data on the prevalence of microvascular and macro- vascular complications of diabetes were evaluated.

**Results:**
We included 2443 patients with mean age of 79.9 ± 3.9 years, in prevalence (54.9%) female. The mean duration of diabetes was 34.9 ± 17 years. Patients were evaluated regularly in person at the diabe- tes clinic on average 2.6 ± 2,1 times per year. 5.8% of patients were treated with insulin pumps. Among patients treated with the conven- tional basal-bolus insulin regimen, most (76.5%) were treated with second-generation basal insulin (glargine U300 or degludec). The most used rapid insulin analogues were lispro (44%), aspart (32.4%), glulisine (10%), and faster aspart (11.9%). Mean HbA1c were 7,8 + 1,1. In comparison to standard therapy, better glycemic control was seen in patients on insulin pumps. As expected, the most prevalent comorbidities were microvascular complications. However, despite the high prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (33.7%) and CKD (39%) only a small portion of patients presented with end-stage disease, with 2.3% of patients having Proliferative Retinopathy (0,4% vison loss), 8,4% having Macular Edema, 0.3% being on dialysis, and 2.5% having a history of amputation or foot ulcer. Cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction and/or stroke and/or coronary and/or peripheral revasculari- zation, coronary and/or peripheral bypass) was detected in 17.8% of patients. Most patients do not achieved good control of cardiovascular risk factors. 77% of patients with previous CV event were treated with anti-platelet therapy. 68% of patients with proteinuria were treated with RAAS inhibitors. Overall quality of care, expressed as Q-Score, was 27.4 + 8,2.

**Conclusion:**
Many people with type 1 diabetes have aged, becoming ’octogenarians’ by being regularly followed up in Italian diabetes cent- ers. The overall quality of care for patients regularly followed up has resulted in a lower-than-expected burden of end-stage renal disease, visual loss, and diabetic foot. Management of CV risk factors could be improved.

**Overweight, obesity, and glycemic control: insights from the T1D Exchange Registry**

1. T1D Exchange, Boston, MA, USA, Division of Endocrinology,

**Background and aims:**
Previous research indicates that overweight and obesity are common in the United States Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) population. The purpose of the current study was to report the fre- quency of overweight and obesity, and to evaluate the relationship between ­HbA levels and BMI in a T1D population.

**Materials and methods:**
Participants were included from the T1D Exchange Registry, an online study of adults with T1D and car- egivers of children with T1D. In this cross-sectional study, adult participants (≥ 18 years) from the T1D Exchange Registry 2023 annual survey were linked to NorstellaLinq’s laboratory data using de-identified tokens, enabling privacy-preserving record linkage across datasets. Participants with self-reported diagnosis in 2022 or 2023 were excluded, as weight and ­HbA are both influenced by new diagnosis and could bias findings. ­HbA levels were obtained from laboratory data, while age, sex, race/ethnicity, automated insulin delivery (AID) use, weight and height (for BMI calculation) were self-reported. The relationship between BMI and ­HbA was explored both linearly (utilizing Pearson’s product-moment correla- tion ) and categorically (utilizing ) at conventional cut-points. A logistic regression model evaluated the relationship between obesity (outcome, defined as BMI>=30) and ­HbA category (exposure), with age, sex, race/ethnicity, and AID as potential confounders.

**Results:**
Overweight (35%) and obesity (30%) were common in study participants (N=978). The frequency of underweight, overweight, and obesity categories by ­HbA level, are reported in Table 1. BMI categories varied by ­HbA level ( p<0.001). When consider- ing both ­HbA and BMI as continuous variables, a weak positive association was observed ( =0.14, <0.001). AID and race/ethnic- ity were not significant in the logistic regression model, and did not impact the relationship between ­HbA and obesity, so they were removed from the model. The odds of obesity increased significantly with higher ­HbA levels (adjusted for sex and age). ­HbA levels of 8.0-8.9 (reference: ­HbA < 6.0) had the highest odds (OR=3.89, p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
The majority (65%) of adults with T1D in this registry were classified as having overweight or obesity. Higher BMI was associated with higher ­HbA levels. A limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design, which makes it challenging to disentangle bidirectional effects between BMI and ­HbA . While BMI was con- sidered as the outcome and ­HbA as the exposure, each variable may influence the other. Given the observed relationship between BMI and HbA1c, strategies aimed at lowering ­HbA may reduce obesity, and strategies aimed at reducing obesity may lower ­HbA . Further research is needed to explore interventions, be they behavioral (e.g. diet, exercise) or medical (e.g. glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ago- nists), that could simultaneously address both weight and glycemic control in individuals with T1D.

5. Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital, Bergen, Norway, University of
6. Bergen, Bergen, Norway, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen,

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with other autoimmune diseases. We assessed the prevalence of celiac, thyroid and Addison’s diseases, and analyzed the impact of celiac and thyroid disease on ­HbA and diabetes complication rates in Norwegian adults with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a cross-sectional study of 25,130 individuals in the Norwegian Diabetes Registry for adults, cat- egorizing patients into groups: T1D only, T1D + celiac disease, and T1D + thyroid disease. The Register for Organ-specific Autoimmune Diseases provided information on Addison’s disease. We used linear and logistic regression to analyze ­HbA and diabetes complications, adjusted for demographics and clinical variables.

**Results:**
Prevalence rates (95% CI) were 6.2% (5.9-6.6) for celiac, 15.9% (15.4-16.5) for thyroid, and 0.5% (0.4-0.6) for Addison’s dis- ease. We observed no differences in ­HbA levels between the celiac and thyroid groups compared to T1D only (Table 1). Adjusted linear regression similarly revealed no ­HbA differences, with coefficients (95% CI) 0.20 (-1.03-0.99) for celiac and 0.12 (-0.56-0.79) for thyroid disease. Logistic regression analyses showed no statistically significant differences in ORs for macrovascular complications (coronary heart disease, stroke and/or arterial surgery distal to the aorta), albuminuria, retinopathy, or neuropathy when comparing T1D only to the celiac and thyroid groups. ORs (95% CI): Macrovascular complications 0.96 (0.62-1.48) for celiac, 0.96 (0.78-1.18) for thyroid disease; albuminu- ria 0.82 (0.58-1.16) for celiac, 0.94 (0.78-1.13) for thyroid disease; retinopathy 0.82 (0.60-1.13) for celiac, 0.95 (0.80-1.14) for thyroid disease; neuropathy 0.77 (0.49-1.20) for celiac, 1.02 (0.83-1.25) for thyroid disease.

**Conclusion:**
Autoimmune comorbidities are common among patients with T1D, but their presence does not affect ­HbA levels or vascular complication rates. This finding may reflect adequate treatment of thy- roid disease and celiac disease among T1D patients.

**Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is associated with lower time in range, longer diabetes duration and altered food intake in a cohort of 418 individuals with type 1 diabetes**

D.F. de Wit, Meijnikman, M. Nieuwdorp, N.M.J. Hanssen

**Background and aims:**
Although pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is thought to be common in type 1 diabetes, its prevalence and clinical features are unclear, and it is unknown if PEI correlates with markers of glycaemic control, residual -cell function and food intake.

**Materials and methods:**
In a cohort of 418 individuals with type 1 diabetes (63% female, mean age 42 ± 15 years, mean BMI 25±4 kg/ m2, median diabetes duration 15 years [IQR 6-29]), we measured fecal elastase (FEC, as proxy for pancreatic insufficiency (defined as FEC <200 μg/g feces)) , (stimulated) urinary-c-peptide-to-creatinine-ratio (UCPCR), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), food intake (using food diaries) and clinical parameters. We used Spearman correlation to express association between these parameters.

**Results:**
Lower FEC-levels correlated with a longer diabetes duration (ρ= -0.17, p<0.01), and a lower UCPCR (ρ= 0.17, p<0.01) Individuals with FEC-levels <200 μg/g feces (15% in our cohort) had inferior gly- caemic control (time in range 60.5 vs 69%, p<0.05 ), a longer diabetes duration (23 vs 17 years, p<0.01) and were more often male (52% vs 34% (p<0.01) and smokers (24 vs 7%, p<0.01). Individuals with low FEC-levels reported less daily intake of fibre- (17.5 vs 20.7 g, p<0.05), protein- (61.6 vs 70.6 g, p<0.05), fat- (67.1 vs. 76.1 g) and overall caloric intake (1488 vs 1657 kcal/day, p<0.01). Excluding patients with self-reported severe diarrhea did not change the results. We did not observe an association between FEC-levels and the occurrence of hypoglycaemia.

**Conclusion:**
Individuals with type 1 diabetes and low FEC-levels report altered food intake and have less favorable glycaemic control, possibly reflecting clinically relevant pancreatic exocrine dysfunc- tion in this group. Future studies should address whether screening individuals with type 1 diabetes for PEI using elastase may help to optimise dietary intake and prevent PEI-associated conditions such as osteoporosis.

**Type 1 diabetes incidence is lower in children of South Asian and Black ethnicity compared to those of White ethnicity: a UK pop- ulation-based study**

K. Young, B. Shields, J. Dennis

**Background and aims:**
Genetic studies have suggested certain ethnicities, particularly those of Asian ethnicity, may have a lower frequency of high-risk HLA alleles which are associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk. Despite this, epidemiological studies of dif- ferences in T1D incidence by ethnicity have mainly been limited to US populations, where incidence is highest in non-Hispanic White youth, lower in African American and Hispanic youth, and lowest in Asian/Pacific Islander and Native American youth. We aimed to investigate whether there is a difference in T1D incidence across major ethnicities in children and adolescents in the UK.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed unselected population-based electronic health records from 5 million children and adolescents aged >1 and <18 years registered in UK primary care (CPRD Aurum) between 1980 and 2021 with recorded ethnicity. Incident T1D was defined as the earliest recorded diabetes code after registra- tion start. We excluded individuals with a recorded T1D diagnosis within 2 months of registration start as these are likely to reflect pre- existing rather than incident diagnoses. Patients were also excluded if they had codes for other diabetes subtypes (e.g. type 2, monogenic). Ethnicity was categorised by major UK census categories based on recorded codes: White (73.5%), South Asian (11.3%), Black (7.8%), Mixed (3.4%), or Other (3.9%). Age-specific incidence, overall and for each ethnicity group, was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, using age as the timescale. Adjusted risk by ethnicity was estimated using age- and sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression.

**Results:**
9,318 children/adolescents out of a total 5,169,543 developed new onset T1D over the study period. The total cumulative incidence of T1D at age 18 years was 0.48% (95% CI: 0.47%, 0.49%). Cumulative incidence at age 18 varied markedly by ethnicity: White 0.53% (95% CI: 0.51%, 0.54%), South Asian 0.29% (95% CI: 0.26%, 0.31%), Black 0.40% (95% CI: 0.36%, 0.43%), Mixed 0.30% (95% CI: 0.25%, 0.35%), Other 0.33% (95% CI: 0.28%, 0.38%). Female sex was associated with an 14% lower risk of developing T1D (HR: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.82, 0.89]), with no significant variation by ethnicity (p>0.05 for interaction across all ethnic groups). Differences by ethnicity were consistent in age- and sex-adjusted analysis: relative to those of White ethnicity (reference group), the adjusted risk was lower in those of South Asian (HR: 0.54 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.58]), Black (HR: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.80]), Mixed (HR: 0.56 [95% CI: 0.47, 0.66]) and Other (HR: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.52, 0.70]) ethnicities respectively.

**Conclusion:**
The risk of developing T1D in childhood varies substan- tially by ethnicity in the UK. Children of South Asian ethnicity have a 46% lower risk, while those of Black ethnicity have a 27% lower risk compared to White children. These differences have important implications for T1D screening programs. Disentangling the genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors underlying these differences is an important area for future research.

4. field, Sheffield, UK, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threat- ening medical emergency requiring prompt, standardised interven- tion. Despite national guidelines for optimising management, real- world adherence has remained inconsistent, potentially compromising patient outcomes. We aimed to evaluate compliance with our estab- lished DKA management protocol and identify key areas to improve adherence.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective longitudinal study included all patients admitted with DKA between September 2022 and August 2023 in the DKA national audit. Data was extracted from electronic and paper records to assess demographics, admis- sion biochemistry, and adherence to insulin and fluid resuscitation regimens. Results are presented as median (IQR) and percentages where appropriate.

**Results:**
Seventy-seven patients with DKA (100 episodes) were identified (44% female). The median age was 45 years (27-60) and body mass index was 24.9 kg/m² (22.5-27.4, n=45). The major- ity were White British (n=63). The median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2 (1-4). Most (73%, n=56) had type 1 diabetes (T1D), 26% had type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=20), and 1% had maturity-onset diabetes of the young (n=1). Among those with T2D, 25% (n=7) were on insulin and 45% (n=9) received SGLT2 inhibitors; one per- son with T1D was also on an SGLT2 inhibitor. Additionally, 7.1% (n=4) of people with T1D used an insulin pump. At presentation, the median pH was 7.21 (7.11-7.27), glucose 25.8 mmol/L (19.4- 33.5, n=92, unrecordable in n=8), bicarbonate 12.7 mmol/L (10.1- 15.7), ketones 5.8 mmol/L (4.8-6.5, n=89), sodium 134.3 mmol/L (132-138), potassium 4.8 mmol/L (4.3-5.4), and the time to DKA resolution was 9.1 hours (7.3-12.7, n=82). Mortality was 4% (n=4), with three receiving end-of-life care; one death was directly attrib- utable to DKA. Six patients required intensive treatment unit admis- sion, of whom one died. Fluid balance charts were maintained in 65%, absent in 26%, and unclear in 9%. Hourly glucose and ketone measurements until DKA resolution were recorded in 61%, with incomplete data in 21% and missing paper records in 18%. 10% Dextrose was prescribed within one hour of blood glucose <14 mmol/L in 52% of cases, while 21% did not receive a prescription. Hypoglycaemia occurred in 11% (n=11), despite timely dextrose in seven cases. Hypokalaemia and hyperkalaemia were observed in 14% and 21% of patients, respectively. The median length of stay was 2 days (1-5, n=96).

**Conclusion:**
Our cohort’s real-world DKA management outcomes aligned with published data. Key areas for improvement included fluid balance monitoring, dextrose prescription, and glucose/ketone monitor- ing. Real-time alerts, automated checklists, and targeted training may enhance compliance and optimise care.

**Background and aims:**
Prediabetes remission (i.e. reaching normal glucose regulation) has been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk reduction in two large cohorts of individuals with prediabetes, the US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the German Prediabetes Life- style Intervention Study (PLIS). However, people going into remission (R) are characterized by lower age, lower fasting-, 2-hour glucose- and HbA1c levels at baseline. To disentangle whether baseline differences explain T2D protection associated with prediabetes remission, we per- formed a baseline matching for these known confounders in PLIS.

**Materials and methods:**
Individuals with prediabetes underwent a 75g oral glucose tolerance test, whole body MRI for body fat distribution and H spectroscopy for intrahepatic lipid (IHL) quantification. Partici- pants underwent 12 months of lifestyle intervention and were stratified to receive either a DPP-like, double of DPP intensity or control interven- tion. Prediabetes remission was defined by normalization of glucose reg- ulation and HbA1c according to ADA criteria (otherwise non-remission, NR). To account for baseline differences of age, fasting, 2h glucose and HbA1c, we performed a propensity score matching for these parameters. Nephropathy was defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g. Longitudinal changes between groups were assessed via mixed effects models and p for group*time interaction is reported. Follow-up data were analyzed using log-rank tests. Normally distributed variables are shown as mean ± SD and skewed variables as median (IQR).

**Results:**
Of the 1105 PLIS participants, propensity score matching yielded 352 individuals (n=176 for R and NR, respectively) with similar age, fasting, 2h glucose and HbA1c at baseline in R vs NR (56.3±10.6 years vs 56.9±9.6, p=0.81; 104±8 mg/dl vs 103±7, p=0.52; 126±29 mg/dl vs 129±31, p=0.43; 5.6±0.3 % vs 5.6±0.3, p=0.79). BMI, IHL and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were also similar between groups (30.8±5.9 kg/m vs 31.6±6.3 kg/m , p=0.25; 7.9±8.2 % vs 7.6±7.0 %, p=0.83; 4.8±2.4 l vs 5.0±2.4 l, p=0.44). By definition, fasting glucose and 2h glucose decreased in R but not NR (R: to 92±5 mg/dl vs NR: to 104±9 mg/dl, p<0.001; R: to 102±20 mg/dl vs NR: 125±32 mg/dl, p<0.001). IHL decreased similarly, but VAT decreased more strongly in R vs NR (R: to 2.8 % [1.5-5.0] vs NR to 3.6 % [1.9-9.0], p=0.42; R: to 4.0 l [2.6-5.3], NR: to 4.3 l [2.7-5.8], p=0.04). Finally, despite matching for known confounders at baseline, R still had a reduced T2D risk vs NR over a median follow up time of 6.1 years (3.1-8.8); RR 0.87 (0.79-0.95), p=0.004. Similarly, relative risk for future nephropathy was reduced in R vs NR (RR 0.83 [0.73-0.96], p=0.004).

**Conclusion:**
A substantial fraction of the relative risk reduction for T2D and nephropathy associated with prediabetes remission is inde- pendent from baseline glycemic parameters and age, underscoring the importance of reaching normal glucose regulation during lifestyle interventions as a therapeutic goal to improve T2D and nephropathy prevention for individuals with prediabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Prediabetes is a state of increased risk of dia- betes. However, the natural history of prediabetes in the working popu- lation is not well described. This study is to characterize the risks of prediabetes and diabetes among working population in a cohort study.

**Materials and methods:**
The study included 14624 working popu- lation (≤65 years old) who underwent a health checkup in 2014 or 2017 and were followed up from 2018 to 2022 (median [range] fol- low-up, 6.0 [4-8] years). Prediabetes was defined according to fasting plasma glucose (FPG level of 100-125mg/dL)) or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%) values or a combination of both using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. Diabetes was defined as HbA1c level ≥ 6.5%, or FPG level ≥ 126 mg/dL). The Cox propor- tional hazards regression model was used to investigate the associations.

**Results:**
A total of 12548 (86%) participants with normoglycemia (mean [SD] age, 38 [10.9] years; 7120 [57%] female), 1448 (10%) participants with pre-diabetes (47 [10.1] years; 677 [47%] female), 628 (8%) par- ticipants with diabetes (51 [9.5] years; 197 [31%] female) attended the follow-up visit. Of the participants with normoglycemia at baseline, 2999 (23.9%) progressed to prediabetes, 288 (2.3%) progressed to diabetes, 9260 (73.8%) had normoglycemia. During follow-up, the participants with 8 years follow-up have the highest prevalence progressed to diabetes. Of the participants with prediabetes at baseline, 405 (28%) progressed to diabetes, 271 (18.7%) regressed to normoglycemia, and the participants with 6 years follow-up have the highest prevalence progressed to diabetes. The highest absolute risk for diabetes was observed among those aged 18-40 years with prediabetes, with an incidence rate (per 1000 person- years) of 46.9. Comparing with normoglycemia, prediabetes had higher incidence rates for progression to diabetes in those aged 18-40 years than 40-65 years (HR (95% CI), 22.1 (14.9-32.7) vs 9.12 (7.45-11.2)). Inter- estingly, for those aged 18-40 years with normoglycemia or prediabetes at baseline, male had higher prevalence progressed to diabetes ( both p<0.001), but this had not observed at those aged 40-65 years.

**Conclusion:**
This study identified a critical 7-year window during which the risk of normoglycemia participants progressed to prediabe- tes or diabetes increases significantly. Notably, men aged 18-40 years old with prediabetes have the highest frequency of developing diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
This study aimed to investigate the role of plasma N-glycans in glucose metabolism and the progression of pre- type 2 diabetes (pre-T2D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

**Materials and methods:**
Longitudinal data from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) F4/FF4 cohort (n = 473) were used to identify glycan profiles associated with early dia- betes stages via ultra-performance liquid chromatography with fluores- cence detection (HILIC-UPLC-FLR). Associations between glycans, pre-T2D/T2D, body mass index (BMI), diabetes-related traits (fasting plasma glucose (FPG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resist- ance (HOMA-IR), and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c)), were evaluated. Predictive models and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) were conducted in KORA FF4 to assess and explain the model’s predic- tive performance. Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted to explore causal relationships between glycans and T2D, BMI, FPG, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c. Finally, glycan quantitative trait loci (glycan- QTL) analyses were carried out to identify genetic loci associated with plasma N-glycans associated with pre-T2D/T2D in KORA FF4.

**Results:**
From KORA F4 to FF4, over 6.5 years, 231 participants pro- gressed to pre-T2D/T2D, while 242 remained normoglycemic. 19 gly- cans were associated with pre-T2D/T2D in the basic model (adjusted for age, sex, and BMI), with 12 remaining significant after full adjust- ment (further including smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activities, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and systolic blood pressure (SBP)). Glycans such as GP32, GP22, GP34, and GP18 showed con- sistent trends, and GP32 and GP18 were robustly linked to BMI, FPG, and HOMA-IR. A combined model of glycans and clinical risk fac- tors achieved high predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.895) in KORA FF4. MR analysis revealed causal links between specific glycans (GP19, S1, GP18) and T2D. Glycan-QTL analysis identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes (e.g., FUT8, ST3GAL4) associated with plasma N-glycans in pre-T2D/T2D.

**Conclusion:**
This study identifies plasma N-glycans as key biomarkers for glucose metabolism and the progression from normoglycemia to pre-T2D and T2D. Specific glycans (e.g., GP32, GP18) are associ- ated with pre-T2D/T2D, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. MR confirmed causal links between glycans and T2D, while glycan-QTL analysis highlighted genetic loci associated with N-glycans, offering new insights for early diabetes detection and prevention.

**Novel subgroups of prediabetes and their association with out- comes: a 4-year follow-up study**

Y. Liu

**Background and aims:**
Preiabetes is presently classified into two main forms, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), but prediabetes in particular is heterogeneous according to pre- vious researches. A refined classification could provide a powerful tool to individualise treatment regimens and identify individuals with increased risk of complications at diagnosis.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed data-driven cluster analysis in patients with prediabetes (n = 2078) from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), and used data from the 2011 baseline survey and four follow-up waves. Clusters were based on four variables (Age, BMI, HbA1c, TyG). Logistic regression were used to explore the relationships between cluster classification and the risk of diabetes, chronic kidney disease(CKD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

**Results:**
Three clusters were identified. Participants with prediabetes were featured by the youngest age and the lowest HbA1c in cluster 0, the highest BMI and TyG index in cluster 1, and the oldest age and the lowest BMI in cluster 2. During 4 years of follow-up, individuals in the cluster 1 (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.55-3.02) had the highest risk of diabetes compared to individuals in the other two clusters. Individuals in the cluster 2 showed the highest risk of CKD (OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.73-6.32) and CVD (OR 1.70, 95%CI 1.14, 2.53), and individuals in the cluster 0 showed the lowest risk after adjusting for other risk factors (P < 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
We were able to categorize prediabetes into three clusters using four routine clinical parameters.This subcategorization has poten- tial value in developing more precise strategies for targeted prediabetes prevention and treatment.

7. Vienna, Austria, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.

**Background and aims:**
Data on prevalence of prediabetes, a high- risk condition for developing diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes, are scarce for Central Europe and lacking for Austria. Hence, we report prevalence data for prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes over a period of seven years.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted an analysis of two databases: the national health insurance health check-up data 2017-2023 and the cross-sectional AUSTRO-PROFIT cohort study in people undergoing health check-ups, that collected more detailed clinical data and health related quality of life. Prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes were diag- nosed using fasting glucose values according to the American Diabetes Association criteria.

**Results:**
We investigated 6 412 591 (3 556 116 females) entries of people without previously known diabetes undergoing health check-ups from 2017 to 2023 in Austria. The crude prevalence of pre-diabetes was 21.084% (95%-CI 21.048 - 21.119) and undiagnosed diabetes was 2.950% (95%-CI 2.936 - 2.963), with age-standardised prevalence of 19.709% (19.708-19.710) and 2.741% (2.740 - 2.742), respectively. Prevalence rates for both prediabetes and diabetes remained stable over the time-period of seven years.In the AUSTRO-PROFIT cohort (N = 620), the prevalence rates were comparable with health check-ups data (26.6% for prediabetes and 3.4% for diabetes). Health-related quality of life was reduced in individuals with disturbed glucose metabolism.

**Conclusion:**
Prediabetes affects approximately one fifth of the adult population undergoing health check-ups in Austria, while in 3% undi- agnosed diabetes was detected. Both conditions are associated with reduced health-related quality of life and higher rates of comorbidities.

**Background and aims:**
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common respiratory disorder that is often underdiagnosed. It repre- sents a significant risk factor in the development of glucose metabolism disorders. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes in a population diagnosed with OSAS

**Materials and methods:**
Through a prospective, descriptive, obser- vational, and monocentric study, we recruited 230 non-diabetic adults diagnosed with OSAS. All patients underwent an oral glucose toler- ance test (OGTT) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing. Predia- betes was defined by the ADA as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/ or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and/or HbA1c ≥5.7% and <6.5%

**Results:**
n:230 ( 121 men and 109 women), with mean age of 50.72 ± 9.61 years a mean body mass index (BMI) of 33.6 ± 6.6 kg/m², and an average apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 24.7 ± 18.6, classified into three severity groups: mild OSAS (36.1%), moderate OSAS (32.2%), and severe OSAS (31.7%). The prevalence of prediabetes was 44.78%. Among these patients, IFG was present in 33.04%, IGT in 17.83%, and elevated HbA1c (≥5.7% and <6.4%) in 25.65%. Univariate analy- sis demonstrated significant associations between prediabetes and age (OR=1.04, IC [1.01- 1.08], p=0.009), obesity (OR= 3.54, IC [1.09 -13.6],p = 0.004), hypertension (OR= 2.80, [1.44, 5.55],p=0.003), metabolic syndrome (OR=5.12, IC [2.51, 10.9],p<0.001), and the desaturation index (OR = 1.06, IC [1.03, 1.11], p<0.001). OSAS was associated with undiagnosed diabetes in 20.43% of cases.

**Conclusion:**
Our study reveals a high prevalence of prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes among patients with obstructive sleep apnea syn- drome (OSAS). These findings emphasize the critical need for early screening of glucose metabolism disorders to mitigate the progression from prediabetes to type2 diabetes and to prevent the onset of macro- vascular and microvascular complications

**Background and aims:**
A post-hoc analysis of the randomised, con- trolled, multicentre Prediabetes Lifestyle Intervention Study (PLIS) demonstrated that weight loss-induced prediabetes remission is driven by improved insulin sensitivity and reduced visceral adipose tissue (VAT). This analysis aims to investigate potential sex differences in these mechanisms, which remains underexplored.

**Materials and methods:**
Of 908 PLIS participants with prediabe- tes who completed a 12-month lifestyle intervention, 289 achieved a clinically significant weight loss of ≥5%. Prediabetes remission was defined as a return to normal glucose levels, accessed by fasting glu- cose, 2-hour OGTT plasma glucose, and HbA1c. Fixed-effects models analyzed sex differences in percentage changes of body fat distribu- tion (assessed by whole body MRI). Linear mixed models compared within- and between-sex changes in insulin sensitivity (calculated by the Matsuda index) and secretion (estimated by AUC​ divided by AUC​ ), and β-cell function (adaptation index) from baseline to 12 months. Kaplan-Meier estimates assessed the 9-year risk of develop- ing type 2 diabetes.

**Results:**
Among those who met weight loss targets, 69 females and 59 males achieved remission, while 81 females and 80 males did not. In the remission group, both sexes showed similar signifi- cant reduction in fat mass (-17.24±2.56 % [p<0.0001] in female vs. -22.52±2.74 in male, p=0.095), VAT (-24.36±4.85 % [p<0.0001] vs. -24.50±4.99 [p<0.0001], p=0.93) and improvements in insulin sensi- tivity (1.53±0.25 arbitrary units [p<0.0001] vs. 2.14±0.27 [p<0.0001], p=0.075). Sex-specific differences included indexes of muscle insu- lin sensitivity, which increased in males only (0.019±0.014 μmol/ [pmol×min] [p=0.21] vs. 0.068±0.016 [p<0.0001], p=0.022, Fig. A), while females showed enhanced β-cell function, characterized by increased insulin secretion (14.17±5.98 pmol/mmol [p=0.016] vs. -3.46±6.74 [p=0.61], p=0.015, Fig B) and improved adaptation index (13448±2170 pmol×ml/[mmol×min×m ] [p<0.0001] vs. 6889±2350 [p=0.0034], p=0.026). In the non-remission group, serving as a con- trol, no significant sex differences were observed. Despite the distinct mechanisms leading to prediabetes remission, both sexes showed com- parable 9-year type 2 diabetes prevention (p=0.30).

**Conclusion:**
Weight loss-induced prediabetes remission involves shared improved insulin sensitivity and reduced VAT in both sexes, but exhibits sex-specific pathways, with males uniquely increasing muscle insulin sensitivity and females enhancing β-cell function. Further stud- ies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.

**Optimal threshold of 1-h post-load plasma glucose for detecting prediabetes**

R. Bouzid

**Background and aims:**
Accumulating longitudinal evidence suggests that a 1-hour PG ≥155 mg/dl (8.6 mmol/l) during the OGTT is an earlier marker of prediabetes than fasting PG, 2-h post-load PG, or HbA1c. Few data exist on the 01-hour blood glucose threshold for glu- cose tolerance testing in the diagnosis of newly diagnosed prediabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
The study was prospective analytic and included 401 subjects at risk of type 2 diabetes. The parameters studied were : sex, age, family history of diabetes, hypertension and cardio- vascular disease, as well as a complete biological work-up including a 75 g glucose tolerance test with determination of blood glucose at 01 hour. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20 software. The threshold of blood glucose at 01 h in the diagnosis of prediabetes was calculated by the ROC curve, and its concordance and correlation with other prediabetes parameters were assessed by the Kappa index and the Pearson R index.

**Results:**
Of the 401 patients recruited, 201 had unrecognized pre- diabetes, with a sex ratio (M/F) of 0.81, and a mean age of 48 years (standard deviation 10.3 years). Prediabetes was defined according to fasting hyperglycemia at the threshold of 110 mg/dl in 72.1% of cases, according to the threshold of 140 mg/dl at the 2nd hour of OGTT in 86% and HbA1c at the threshold of 5.7% in 69.4%. The mean blood glucose value at 01 hour in prediabetic subjects was 191 ± 33 mg/dl, with a range of 200 mg/dl. Blood glucose at T60 above the consensus threshold of 155 mg/dl affected 89.5% of prediabetic subjects, With 89% sensitivity and 35% specificity. It had low concordance with fast- ing hyperglycemia and HbA1c and a moderate 0.591 for blood glucose at T120, a strong correlation with T120 blood glucose with an R-value of 0.606, and moderate with fasting hyperglycemia and HbA1c with an R-value of 0.300 and 0.335 respectively. One-hour blood glucose analysis in the diagnosis of prediabetes had an area under the ROC curve of 0.872, with an optimal threshold of 1.65 g/l a balance of 86% sensitivity and 78% specificity. Blood glucose at T 60 above the opti- mal threshold of 165 mg/dl had a low concordance with fasting hyper- glycemia and HbA1c, and a moderate concordance of 0.572 for blood glucose at T 120. It had a strong correlation with T120 blood glucose with an R-value of 0.635, and moderate with fasting hyperglycemia and HbA1c with an R-value of 0.371 and 0.406 respectively.

**Conclusion:**
The optimal 01-hour blood glucose threshold identifying prediabetes was 165 mg/dl higher than the consensus threshold of 155 mg/dl. It had a good balance between sensitivity and specificity, and correlated more strongly with blood glucose at T 120 minutes and bet- ter with fasting blood glucose and HbA1c than the 155 ml/dl threshold. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the predictive value of 01-hour OGTT and its optimal threshold as a validated tool for the diagnosis of prediabetes.

**The association between body mass index and mortality: a cohort study**

S. Gribsholt, J. ­Bruun

1. Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus,
2. Denmark, Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine,

**Background and aims:**
The prevalence of obesity is increasing and the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and mortality is not fully understood. This paper aims to examine this association and the impact of age, sex, comorbidities, and educational level.

**Materials and methods:**
We retrieved data on BMI from a large cohort of persons with Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA)-scans in Denmark, linking these data to data from National Health Registries. We used adjusted Cox regression analyses to compute Hazard Ratios (HR) of mortality according to BMI-category, using BMI 22.5-<25.0 k/m as reference. We performed stratified analyses on sex, age, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and educational level.

**Results:**
Among 97,848 persons, 7,808 (8.0%) died. The adjusted HR (aHR) of death was 2.79 (95% confidence interval (CI); 2.53, 3.06) for the BMI category <18.5 kg/m , 1.98 (95% CI; 1.80, 2.18) for BMI 18.5- <20.0 k/m , 1.28 (95% CI; 1.19, 1.38) for BMI 20.0-<22.5 k/m , and the aHR was 2.19 (95% CI; 1.90, 2.65) for the BMI category ≥40.0 kg/m . We found no differences in mortality in the BMI categories 25.0 to <27.5 kg/m : aHR: 0.96 (95%CI; 0.90, 1.03), 27.5 to <30.0 kg/m : aHR: 0.97 (95%CI; 0.90, 1.05), and 30.0 to <35.0 kg/m : aHR: 1.05 (95%CI; 0.97, 1.14), when compared to BMI 22.5 to <25.0 kg/m . Results were similar when stratified by sex, comorbidity level, and educational level.

**Conclusion:**
We found a U-shaped association between BMI and mor- tality with the lowest mortality associated with a BMI between 22.5 kg/ m and 30.0 kg/m and not even increased among people with a very high BMI (BMI 35 kg/m ). We found no large differences according to sex, comorbidity level, and educational level.

3. cine, Astana, Kazakhstan, CAD of Internal Medicine, Corporate fund

**Background and aims:**
Central Asia (CA) has a substantial and rapidly growing burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which represents the main cause of morbid-mortality, with metabolic risks factors playing a crucial role in it. However, comprehensive epidemiological data on CVD and metabolic risk factors in CA is still underepresented in a global assessment. This study analyzed the contribution of metabolic risk factors on CVD mortality in CA.

**Materials and methods:**
The data from the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) that provides mortality, prevalence, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for CVD associated with metabolic risks in CA from 1990- to 2021 years was analysed. The metabolic risks included fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile levels, systolic bloood pressure, BMI, kidney dysfunction, low bone mineral density.

**Results:**
The CVD mortality associated with metabolic risks factors per- centage increased slighty from 73.6% in 1990 (95% CI: 66.4 - 79.5 %) to 74.9% in 2021 ( 95% CI: 68.2 - 80.9 %) for both sexes. Mortality rate (per 100,000) showed an increasing trend from 1990 227.6 (95% CI: 203.1 - 247.3) through 2021 285.4 (95% CI: 256.1 - 309.1); the same pattern was observed in both males and females. DALY rate showed an upward trend through the period, in 1990: 5,242.7 per 100,000 (95% CI: 4,668.5 - 5,736.0), and in 2021: 5,741.2 per 100,000 (95% CI: 5,163.9 - 6,265.7). For male increased numbers from 4,814.7 per 100,000 (95% CI: 4,290.9 - 5,260.6) in 1990 to 5,282.1 per 100,000 (95% CI: 4,738.0 - 5,821.0) in 2021; for females the same progression, from 5,662.31 per 100,000 (95% CI: 5,016.7 - 6,229.5) in 1990 to 6,194.62 per 100,000 (95% CI: 5,553.5 - 6,831.1) in 2021.

**Conclusion:**
The study demonstrated a concerning trend related to mor- tality and DALYs in CA. It highlights the need for healthcare systems in CA to proactively aim for integrated healthcare approaches needed to prevent and manage these metabolic risk factors.

**Background and aims:**
An increased risk of mortality in patients with diabetes has been reported in previous studies. However, whether this evidence applies to the elderly population remains unclear. Some reports suggest that the mortality risk associated with diabetes decreases with age. As the global population continues to age, there is a growing need to establish evidence in this demographic. The present study aimed to investigate this association in the oldest-old population.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a cohort study using data from consecutive patients aged 85 years and older who began receiv- ing home medical care between December 2018 and March 2022 at Medical Corporation Sanritsukai Sowa Clinic, located in a suburban area of Tokyo, Japan. A total of 688 patients were included in the analysis. The cohort was divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of diabetes. Patients were followed until September 2022 or for a maximum duration of two and a half years. Mortality rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to assess differences in mortality between patients with and with- out diabetes. Cox regression analysis was performed to calculate the hazard ratio for mortality associated with diabetes, adjusting for age, sex, reason for initiating home medical care, and level of care needed. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of Kitasato University School of Medicine.

**Results:**
Among the 688 patients (mean age: 90 years), 134 had diabe- tes. The main reasons for initiating home medical care were frailty due to aging, dementia, and cancer. At baseline, patients with diabetes were slightly but significantly younger than those without diabetes (mean age: 89.7 vs. 90.5 years, respectively). HbA1c levels were 5.3% in those without diabetes and 6.9% in those with diabetes. Other baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. During a median follow-up period of 242 days, a total of 314 deaths were reported, yielding 195,858 person-days. The overall mortality rate was 1.6 per 1,000 person-days, with mortality rates of 2.0 and 1.5 per 1,000 person-days in patients with and without diabetes, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that patients with diabetes had a significantly higher mortality rate (p < 0.05). Cox regression analysis revealed that the hazard ratio for mortality in patients with diabetes was 1.31 (95% CI: 1.00-1.71). After adjusting for covariates, the hazard ratio increased to 1.35 (95% CI: 1.02-1.77), indicating a 35% higher risk compared to those without diabetes.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrated that even in the oldest-old population, diabetes was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality. Given the global trend of population aging, further research is needed to establish new evidence on diabetes in the elderly population.

**Carbohydrate quality, metabolomic signatures and risk of mortal- ity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease**

A. Lahiri

**Background and aims:**
The link of carbohydrate intakes or a low- carbohydrate diet to cardiometabolic disease incidence and mortal- ity has been debated. Using metabolomics to understand the meta- bolic imprint of those dietary exposures may help characterize their physiologic effects and between-population heterogeneity. We aimed to identify metabolites related to carb intakes and low-carbohydrate diets and investigate associations of the metabolites with mortality and incidence of cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD, total; ischemic heart disease (IHD); and stroke).

**Materials and methods:**
We evaluated 47,891 UK-Biobank par- ticipants (mean age 56.0 ± 0.04 years; 55.6% women) with baseline dietary, metabolomics data, and longitudinal outcomes identified over median 9.9 years of follow-up. We assessed five carbohydrate-related dietary exposures from 24-hour dietary recalls: diets reflecting low- carbohydrate diet score (LCDS), plant and animal-based LCDS, and composite sources of healthful (whole grains, fruits, legumes and vegetables without potatoes) and unhealthful (refined grains, fruit juices, sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts and confectionary, pota- toes) carbohydrate intakes. We derived and internally validated a metabolomic signature of each of these exposures using elastic net regression based on 168 metabolites measured using nuclear mag- netic resonance spectroscopy. We investigated associations with mortality and incidence endpoints using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression.

**Results:**
Carbohydrate intakes and LCDSs were characterized by 67 shared metabolites primarily in lipid, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism pathways (Figure). The metabolite scores were modestly correlated with respective dietary variables (r range: 0.18-0.29). Par- ticipants with a higher healthful carbohydrate metabolomic signature had lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio of the top to the bottom quintile groups: 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.68-0.91) and CVD mortality (0.61, 0.44-0.84). The LCDS metabolomic signature was associated with higher incidence of T2D (1.27, 1.07-1.52). Those with a metabolomic signature of unhealthy carbohydrate intake expe- rienced higher all-cause mortality (1.17, 1.01-1.35) and CVD (1.12, 1.02-1.24), IHD (1.16, 1.03-1.29) and T2D incidence (1.22, 1.02- 1.45). The metabolomic signatures explained 20-51% of the asso- ciations between self-reported carbohydrate exposures and health outcomes (p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Metabolomic signatures that differently reflected car- bohydrate quality showed heterogeneous associations with mortality and cardiometabolic disease incidence in a British population, sug- gesting potentially heterogeneous biological effects of carbohydrate on mortality and cardiometabolic risks.

**Background and aims:**
Undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes are fre- quently identified in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), yet their prognostic role remains understudied. We investigated the association of dysglycaemia with all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients presenting with ACS in Styria, Austria.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed STRONG-MI registry data of 3,612 patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes who underwent coronary catheterization for ACS between 2007 and 2016. Glycaemic status was defined based on admission glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values: diabetes (HbA1c <5.7%), pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.7%-6.4%), and diabetes (HbA1c ≥6.5%). Clinical outcomes comprised all-cause death, composite MACE, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovas- cular death. Multiple Cox regression was applied to assess the asso- ciation of continuous HbA1c and glycemic categories with outcomes, adjusting for clinical risk factors.

**Results:**
In this cohort, 51% had no diabetes, 42% had pre-diabetes, and 7.1% had previously undiagnosed diabetes. Incidence rates (per 1,000 person-years) of all-cause and cardiovascular death increased across glycemic categories: 27.4 and 11.5 (no diabetes), 36.9 and 17.4 (pre- diabetes), and 47.6 and 22.2 (diabetes). The risk of all-cause death was 1.06 (95%CI: 0.94-1.21, p=0.344) for pre-diabetes and 1.36 (95%CI: 1.10-1.69, p=0.005) for diabetes compared to no diabetes. The risk of cardiovascular death was 1.18 (95%CI: 0.98-1.42, p=0.082) for pre- diabetes and 1.40 (95%CI: 1.04-1.90, p=0.028) for diabetes compared to no diabetes. Likewise, the risk of all-cause death was 1.20 (95%CI: 1.06-1.35, p=0.004) and cardiovascular death was 1.23 (95%CI: 1.04- 1.46, p=0.019) for 1-SD increase in HbA1c (0.68%).

**Conclusion:**
Undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes at the time of ACS are associated with an increase in all-cause and cardiovascular death. Systematic screening and early intensive risk factor management may improve post-ACS outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a pressing global health challenge, contributing significantly to both morbidity and mor- tality worldwide. Despite advancements in pharmacological therapies, risk factor management, and healthcare delivery, the impact of these improvements on mortality trends remains unclear, especially within the context of declining US life expectancy. This study aimed to evalu- ate trends in all-cause mortality and medication prescribing patterns among individuals with T2D diagnosed 5-10 years ago versus 10-20 years ago, with subgroup analyses stratified by race, age at diagnosis, sex, and pre-existing disability.

**Materials and methods:**
Using federated data from the TriNetX Global Collaborative Network, we conducted a retrospective analysis of individuals diagnosed with T2D 5-10 years ago and compared this to a cohort of individuals diagnosed 10-20 years ago. Propensity score matching controlled for age at diagnosis. Propensity score matching controlled for age at diagnosis. Individuals were followed up for 5 years. Subgroup analyses were performed, stratifying by age, sex, race and presence or absence of pre-existing disability.

**Results:**
429,284 individuals with T2D were included. There was a small but significant reduction in all-cause mortality between individu- als diagnosed with T2D 5-10 years ago vs 10-20 years ago (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.99, p=0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed persistent disparities. Reduction in mortality was reported in individuals without pre-existing disabilities (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, p<0.001) but not with disability (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.10, p=0.619); in individuals aged 40-64 years (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.97, p=0.004) but not in individuals aged ≤39 (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46-1.06, p=0.093) or ≥64 years (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.03, p=0.623). Black individuals diag- nosed more recently demonstrated an increase in mortality risk (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.12, p=0.001). Both females and males demon- strated similar reductions in mortality with more recent diagnosis (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98, p=0.001; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.97, p<0.001 respectively). Increased use of SGLT2 inhibitors (OR 5.10, 95% CI 4.93-5.23), GLP-1 receptor agonists (OR 3.18, 95% CI 3.11-3.26), and reduced use of thiazolidinediones (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.59-0.62) and sulphonylureas (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.67-0.69) were noted among more recently diagnosed individuals.

**Conclusion:**
Despite advancements in diabetes care, improvements in mortality remain inconsistent. People aged ≤39 or ≥65 years and those with pre-existing disability have not shared a reduction in mortal- ity compared to the overall population. Black people diagnosed more recently have experienced worsening of mortality, highlighting per- sistent disparities.

**Background and aims:**
Hyperglycemic emergencies include dia- betic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). The recently revised diagnostic criteria of HHS are blood glucose ≥30 mmol/L, effective plasma osmolarity (2x sodium + glu- cose) ≥300 mmol/L or total plasma osmolarity (2x sodium + glucose + urea) ≥320 mmol/L, mild or no ketoacidosis, and dehydration. The criterion of osmolarity in patients with HHS is based on consensus reports and case series. However, the association between osmolar- ity and mortality in patients with extreme hyperglycemia remains unclear. We aimed to study the association between osmolarity and 30-day mortality in patients with blood glucose levels ≥30 mmol/L, and to examine the optimal threshold of osmolarity when consider- ing mortality risk.

**Materials and methods:**
This etiological population-based register study included acutely admitted patients aged ≥18 years from all Danish public hospitals in the five-year period 2017-2021 with glu- cose ≥30 mmol/L at arrival. Patients with a DKA diagnosis during the hospitalization were excluded. The effective osmolarity was cal- culated from blood tests at admission. We assessed the association between 30-day mortality from arrival and osmolarity by computing a logistic regression modelled as a spline curve. We adjusted the model for potential confounders as sociodemographic factors, comorbidities and prescribed medicine. Lastly, we calculated the Youden Index for patients with osmolarity ≥290 mmol/L to find the optimal osmolarity cutoff point for mortality.

**Results:**
We included 5180 patients in this study. The median age was 69 years and the patients were mostly male (63%). Almost one-third of the patients did not have a diabetes diagnosis at admission (30%). The 30-day mortality was 13% (n=682). The best fitted logistic regres- sion model featured a linear spline with 4 knots at 294, 302, 312, and 332 mmol/L. The spline curve resembled a U-shape in which mor- tality risk was increasing with osmolarity of more or less than 294 mmol/L (Figure). The relationship remained robust after adjusting for confounders. The Youden Index was 307 mmol/L (sensitivity: 0.57; specificity: 0.76).

**Conclusion:**
The 30-day mortality of patients with extreme hypergly- cemia was high. We identified a nonlinear association between osmo- larity and mortality with increasing mortality risk at both high and low osmolarity levels in patients with extreme hyperglycemia. This study suggests that the threshold for effective osmolarity in patients with extreme hyperglycemia should be around 307 mmol/L when consider- ing mortality risk.

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main driver of mortality in Mexico, and diabetes is a recognized acceler- ant. In 2018, novel data-driven subgroups of adult-onset diabetes were described: mild obesity-related, mild age-related, severe insulin- resistant, severe insulin-deficient, and severe autoimmune. In 2020, these were replicated in a Mexican population. Here, we aimed to characterize differences in fatal CVD risk among diabetes subgroups in Mexican adults.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed mortality among participants in prospective cohort of adults aged ≥35 recruited from 1998-2004 in Mexico City. Diabetes subgroups were derived using a self-normalizing neural networks algorithm, excluding autoimmune cases. The char- acteristics of the participants and the number of cardiovascular fatal events were described. The Kaplan-Meier estimator with inverse prob- ability weighting for the subgroups was obtained and a Cox model was fitted using the subgroups.

**Results:**
Among 25,076 participants, 67.2% were female, with a mean (SD) age of 58±12 years. Over a median follow-up of 15.4 years, a total of 2,091 (8.3%) fatal CVD events were detected. Severe insu- lin-deficient was the most prevalent subgroup with 12,602 (50.3%) participants, followed by severe insulin-resistant with 4,360 (17.4%), mild age-related with 4,240 (16.9%), and mild obesity-related with 3,874 (15.4%). The insulin-deficient subgroup had the lowest adjusted survival compared to other subgroups (Figure 1). A Cox model was fitted using subgroup and adjusted for other variables. Compared to the mild obesity-related subgroup, adjusted hazard ratios for risk of CVD mortality for each of the subgroups were 1.07 (95%CI 0.89-1.3) for severe insulin-resistant, 1.23 (95%CI 1.02-1.48) for mild age-related, and 1.55 (CI 95% 1.33-1.8) for severe insulin-deficient.

**Conclusion:**
Among participants with diabetes from a cohort in Mex- ico City, risk of fatal CVD varied significantly among subgroups, and severe insulin-deficient subgroup had the highest risk. Data-driven subgroups offer a promising approach to address this heterogeneity.

**Dietary intake and body composition in 3-year-old offspring of mothers with gestational diabetes: insights from the PONCH cohort**

S. Åberg

**Background and aims:**
The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age has been accompanied by a rising global incidence of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), currently affecting 1-24% of pregnancies. Maternal glycemia influences intrau- terine growth, early adiposity, and long-term metabolic health, with signs of metabolic syndrome emerging already in childhood. Although increased risks of neonatal complications and childhood obesity in offspring of mothers with GDM have been shown, few studies have specifically investigated differences in body composition, anthropomet- ric measures, and their associations with lifestyle factors in children of GDM versus normoglycemic mothers. The longitudinal PONCH cohort tracks women with GDM or obesity and their children. Recent findings show distinct epigenetic profiles in newborns. Maternal body fat was found to predict adiposity in offspring of obese mothers specifically, whereas maternal glycemic status was strongly correlated with fasting, glucose and insulin in offspring of GDM mothers. The present study aims to investigate dietary intake in 3-year-old children of normogly- cemic mothers (normal weight and obese) and children of mothers with GDM. We further explore associations between dietary habits and anthropometric measures.

**Materials and methods:**
Normal weight (BMI 18-25) and obese (BMI >30) women were recruited at 8-12 weeks of gestation, while women with GDM were enrolled at the time of diagnosis. Their chil- dren have been continuously invited to follow-up visits for clinical assessments, including body composition, anthropometric measure- ments, blood sampling, and questionnaires. At three years of age, 113 children underwent body composition assessment using BodPod (Air Displacement Plethysmography), and habitual dietary intake was evalu- ated using validated Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ) completed by the mothers.

**Results:**
Children of mothers with GDM had significantly higher intake of chips and nachos (8.5 ± 8 g/week) compared to those of normoglycemic mothers (5.5 ± 7 g/week). Similarly, diet soda intake was higher among children of GDM mothers (99.5 ± 232 g/week) compared to those of normoglycemic mothers (42.8 ± 231 g/week). In contrast, high-fat margarine intake was markedly higher in children of normoglycemic mothers (40.4 g/week) versus low-fat margarine (15.3 g/week, p < 0.001), whereas margarine intake was similar among children of GDM mothers. Interestingly, high-fat margarine intake cor- related positively with body fat percentage in children of normogly- cemic mothers (r = 0.29, p = 0.02), but inversely in those of GDM mothers (r = -0.52, p = 0.03). Additionally, intake of buns and cakes was positively associated with body weight and BMI (r = 0.46, p < 0.05) in children of GDM mothers, while no such associations were observed in children of normoglycemic mothers.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest distinct dietary patterns in children of mothers with GDM compared to normoglycemic mothers, which may have implications for early body composition and metabolic health. Further studies including metabolic biomarkers are needed to disentangle the contributions of intrauterine programming versus modifiable lifestyle factors in long-term health outcomes in this group of high-risk children.

1. Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg,
2. Gothenburg, Sweden, AstraZeneca R&D, Gothenburg, Sweden.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as glucose intolerance during pregnancy, significantly increases the lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Both impaired sleep and stress have been associated with the metabolic syndrome and T2D. This study aimed to investigate the associations between glucose toler- ance, metabolic health markers, stress, and sleep patterns four years after a GDM pregnancy.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from the 4-year postpartum follow-up of the PREPP study (PREvention of PostPartum diabetes). Participants were classified into three groups based on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results: normal glucose tolerance (NGT, = 140), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, = 29), and T2D ( = 13). Clinical assessments included body composition, blood analyses, and other metabolic markers. Sleep and stress patterns were assessed using the Oura ring, a wearable device that recorded data over 14 days. Heart rate variability (HRV) was used as a measure of stress.

**Results:**
The T2D group had significantly shorter sleep duration com- pared to the IGT and NGT groups (6.4 vs. 6.8 vs. 6.8 hours, = 0.039). HRV correlated negatively with fat mass ( = 0.038), systolic ( = 0.027) and diastolic ( = 0.002) blood pressure, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, = 0.002), among other markers of metabolic impairment. Additionally, light sleep duration, sleep balance score, and total sleep duration showed notable correlations with clinical health variables.

**Conclusion:**
Longer sleep duration, better sleep quality, and lower stress levels were associated with markers of better metabolic health in women four years after GDM. These findings highlight the potential role of sleep and stress management in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome and T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) face a significantly increased risk of developing dys- glycemia or type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with a four-fold higher incidence in Singapore compared to global averages. Despite this, few postpartum programs address sustained lifestyle changes in this high-risk popula- tion. The Integrated Hyperglycaemia Incentivised Postnatal Surveil- lance Study (I-HIPS) pioneers a hospital-based, multi-component intervention combining wearable technology, personalized goal-setting, and a novel behavioral assessment (6P tool) to reduce the incidence of T2DM by 10%. This abstract characterizes the baseline cardiometa- bolic risk profiles of participants and identifies early predictors for future metabolic dysfunction.

**Materials and methods:**
Eligible participants included women with prior GDM, a normal postnatal OGTT (6-8 weeks postpartum), and BMI 20-40 kg/m². Enrollment of 200 study participants was completed in February 2025. Participants were randomized (1:1) at 8-10 weeks postpartum to either the I-HIPS intervention (which includes continu- ous glucose monitoring, Fitbit tracking, goal-setting workshops, and the 6P behavioral tool) for 6 months, or standard postnatal care at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. We report participant flow and baseline cardiometabolic risk factors.

**Results:**
Of 996 screened, 200 were randomized (20.1%). The most common exclusion reasons were disinterest (50.5%) and failure to com- plete the postnatal OGTT (49.5%). The mean age was 33.9 years (SD: 4.2), with 58.0% of Chinese, 23.0% Malay, and 12.0% Indian ethnicity. Notably, 74.0% were overweight or obese, and 38.0% had a first-degree relative with T2DM—key predictors of metabolic dysfunction. Despite a normal OGTT, the mean HbA1c was 5.6% (SD: 0.3), suggesting early glycemic abnormalities. Mean cholesterol was 5.5 mmol/L (SD: 0.9), indicating subclinical dyslipidemia. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted postpartum interventions.

**Conclusion:**
The I-HIPS trial enrolled a multi-ethnic, high-risk cohort of postpartum women with prior GDM. Despite normal OGTT results, the high prevalence of overweight/obesity, family history of T2DM, and early signs of cardiometabolic dysfunction highlight critical win- dows for intervention. These findings reinforce the need for scalable, technology-enabled lifestyle programs to curb diabetes progression in this vulnerable population. Participants in this ongoing trial will be followed for up to 36 months to assess the primary outcomes related to T2DM.

**In utero exposure to maternal gestational diabetes and depression in association with childhood obesity risk**

A. Ferrara

**Background and aims:**
Both in utero exposure to maternal gestational diabetes (GDM) and prenatal depression have been shown to increase childhood obesity risk, but their combined effect is unknown. We assessed the combined effect of maternal GDM and prenatal depres- sion on childhood obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
At Kaiser Permanente, pregnant indi- viduals were universally screened for GDM and prenatal depression (2011-2019). Their children had height and weight recorded in the medical records. Obesity was defined as a sex and age-specific BMI- z-score≥95th percentile based on CDC metrics. Children ages 5-7 years (N=116,398) and ages 8-10 years (N=44,894) were analyzed separately. Adjusted Poisson regression with robust standard errors assessed the association between GDM and childhood obesity, stratified by prenatal depression status.

**Results:**
Pregnant individuals were on average 31±5 years at delivery, had pre-pregnancy overweight (BMI 26±6 kg/m²), and were racially/ ethnically diverse (27% Asian/Pacific Islander, 6% Black, 26% His- panic, 36% White). Both GDM and prenatal depression were indi- vidually significantly associated with childhood obesity. In models stratifying individuals by prenatal depression status and adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, neighborhood deprivation index, parity, and smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy, in utero exposure to GDM was significantly associated with higher obesity risk at ages 5-7 (depression: RR 1.07 [95% CI 1.05, 1.09]; no depression: 1.06 [1.05, 1.07]) and ages 8-10 (depression: 1.07 [1.04, 1.11]; no depression: 1.06 [1.05, 1.08]). When additionally adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI, associations were slightly attenuated but remained significant (ages 5-7: depression: 1.03 [1.01, 1.05]; no depression: 1.03 [1.02, 1.03]; ages 8-10: depression: 1.03 [1.00, 1.07]; no depression: 1.02 [1.01, 1.03]).

**Conclusion:**
In a large and diverse population, in utero exposure to GDM was associated with an increased risk of childhood obesity, with similar risk levels observed in children regardless of prenatal depres- sion exposure.

**Exploring intersectional cultural experiences of diabetes preven- tion after gestational diabetes among Chinese and South Asian women in Australia**

Y. Dou

**Background and aims:**
Women with a history of GDM are up to seven times more likely to develop T2DM within 5 to 10 years post- partum compared to those with normoglycaemic pregnancies. People of Asian descent also face a higher risk of developing GDM compared to White populations. However, most existing research has focused on Western populations, with preventive strategies and interventions largely designed within Western frameworks that may not align with the needs of Asian groups. There is a pressing need to address this gap among high-risk, non-White populations. This study investigates how cultural context and lived experience shape GDM-related beliefs and T2DM prevention among migrant Chinese and South Asian postpartum women in Australia.

**Materials and methods:**
This study employed a qualitative design using semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of Chinese and South Asian women in Australia with a history of GDM, focusing on beliefs and perceptions related to diabetes prevention. Guided by intersectionality and critical theory, the research examined how dia- betes prevention is shaped by broader social identities and structural contexts. A total of 35 postpartum women participated, including 20 Chinese and 15 South Asian women. The study drew on the concept of social imaginaries to interpret participants’ beliefs and experiences. Data were analysed using narrative, discourse, and frame analysis to capture the complex interplay between culture, lived experience, and health-related decision-making.

**Results:**
Migrant Chinese and South Asian women in Australia faced both shared and distinct challenges in managing GDM. Both groups reported a lack of culturally appropriate support—Chinese women noted limited, culturally insensitive care, while South Asian women encountered language barriers, inconsistent diagnostic criteria, and inadequate tailored advice. Traditional food practices complicated management for both groups, especially when family members were unaware of dietary needs. Chinese women reported emotional dis- tress due to judgment and misunderstanding from family, whereas South Asian women experienced isolation from overseas family and raised more concerns about mental health, insulin stigma, and fertility pressures.

**Conclusion:**
GDM management among migrant women is shaped by intersecting cultural, emotional, and systemic factors, highlighting the need for more inclusive, culturally responsive care.

**Systematic review of the health beliefs and perspectives on gesta- tional diabetes in women after pregnancy: a comparative study across different cultures**

Y. Dou

**Background and aims:**
Although many studies have explored barri- ers to T2DM prevention and self-management in postpartum women with a history of GDM and put forward a lot of suggestions, women in different countries still encounter challenges in implementing healthy lifestyles and screening. Beliefs and assumptions about health and ill- ness play a significant role in shaping health-related behavior, such as self-care and seeking healthcare. To date, no existing reviews have been found concerning beliefs and perspectives about GDM in women after pregnancy or the cultural influences on T2DM prevention after GDM across countries. This systematic review summarizes and com- pares postpartum beliefs about GDM among Chinese, South Asian, and White women. It also explores how cultural background and migration shape the experiences of migrant Chinese and South Asian women regarding GDM and its long-term impacts.

**Materials and methods:**
A comprehensive literature search was con- ducted across multiple electronic databases. Included studies focused on women aged 18 years and older who were at risk of, currently expe- riencing, or had a previous diagnosis of GDM. The review targeted beliefs, perceptions, or assumptions related to GDM or the risk of developing T2DM after GDM. This included perspectives on illness, health, self-care practices, and care-seeking behaviors. Only qualitative and mixed-methods studies were eligible for inclusion, with a particu- lar emphasis on studies stratified by ethnicity or cultural background. Data synthesis was conducted using the thematic synthesis approach developed by Thomas and Harden.

**Results:**
40 articles related to postpartum GDM management or screen- ing were included. This study highlights the significant role of cultural differences among Chinese, South Asian, and White women in shaping the beliefs and perspectives on post-GDM management, including life- style modifications, glucose screening, risk perception, and healthcare engagement experiences. Beyond this, we further examine disparities between immigrant populations (Chinese and South Asian) and their native counterparts, focusing on how acculturation, socioeconomic bar- riers, and healthcare accessibility differentially influence their post- GDM management strategies. Although common challenges exist across populations, including the negotiation of familial obligations and screening-related anxieties, cultural practices and belief systems demonstrate a critical role in mediating women’s engagement with these challenges. Enhancing post-GDM management requires cultur- ally sensitive health education, effective communication, and respon- siveness to the diverse needs of cultural groups, delivered through household-integrated strategies and flexible follow-up schedules that align with women’s daily routines—minimizing conflicts not only with caregiving responsibilities but also with work demands, while engaging family support systems to promote sustained participation without add- ing to their overall burden.

**Conclusion:**
The findings reveal significant cultural differences, along with some commonalities, across White, Chinese, and South Asian women in these areas. Healthcare providers and policymakers must consider these cultural related factors and systemic barriers in real- world implementation when designing interventions and support ser- vices for post-GDM care, particularly in immigrant populations.

**Background and aims:**
Women with prior gestational diabetes (GDM) are at a significantly higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM), yet there are limited tools that translate behavioral insights into actiona- ble prevention strategies. The 6P (Portion, Proportion, Pleasure, Phase, Physicality, Psychology) tool, grounded in mental models of behavior change, is designed to track and promote sustainable improvements in diet and physical activity. As part of a multi-component randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to prevent T2DM in women with a his- tory of GDM, we analyzed the association between 6P scores and car- diometabolic risk factors at baseline.

**Materials and methods:**
In an ongoing prospective randomized con- trolled trial, which completed enrollment of 200 participants in Feb- ruary 2025, we performed a within-group analysis of the intervention group using baseline data. The Integrated Hyperglycaemia Incentivised Postnatal Surveillance Study (I-HIPS) pioneers a hospital-based, multi- component intervention combining wearable technology, personalized goal-setting, and a novel behavioral assessment (6P tool) versus a control group receiving standardized routine postnatal care to reduce the inci- dence of T2DM by 10%. The 6P tool was self-administered by partici- pants. A total of 100 participants from the intervention arm completed the 6P tool. The 6P total composite score was divided into 5-unit incre- ments to capture clinically meaningful variations in lifestyle behaviors. Higher 6P scores indicate poorer adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors. The primary endpoint was BMI status (normal, overweight, obese); other outcomes included plasma lipid levels and glycemic control. Multinomial logistic regression and linear regression adjusted for ethnicity, education, parity, and age were used to examine these associations.

**Results:**
Higher 6P scores were significantly associated with increased adiposity. For every 5-unit increment in the 6P score, the relative risk of being overweight increased by 59% (RR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.08-2.33, p<0.05), while the risk of obesity doubled (RR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.14- 3.62, p<0.05). Additionally, each 5-unit increase was linked to a 0.87% (95% CI: 0.26-1.47, p<0.05) rise in body fat percentage. No significant associations were found with glycemic or lipid markers.

**Conclusion:**
The 6P tool reveals a significant association between life- style behavior patterns and increased adiposity in postpartum women with prior GDM. Notably, higher 6P scores—indicating suboptimal lifestyle behaviors—were linked to greater risks of being overweight and obese. These findings highlight the 6P tool’s potential to identify individuals at heightened cardiometabolic risk and personalize future intervention strategies to prevent T2DM.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk var- ies by area and is potentially associated with social disparity and varia- tion in the built environment. There remains limited evidence examin- ing the impact of environment on GDM risk. This study examined the association between environmental factors (social and built) and GDM risk at the local area level in Australia.

**Materials and methods:**
An ecological study was undertaken using multisource national data at Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2: medium- sized geographical unit) in Australia’s largest cities from 2016-22. SA2-level GDM cases, women who gave birth, social (neighbourhood socioeconomic and ethnicity status) and built environment (food and physical activity resources) data were obtained from national diabe- tes, birth, and environmental data registries. Spatiotemporal ecological regression was undertaken, and an adjusted risk ratio with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) was estimated. Effect modification analysis by socio- economic and ethnicity was performed.

**Results:**
Across 1,486 SA2s, 207,163 GDM cases occurred from 1,719,396 births. In areas with a high concentration of migrant women (location quotient ≥1), GDM was 1.10 (95% CrI; 1.07, 1.13) com- pared to low concentration. GDM risk was 18% (1.18[95% CrI; 1.10, 1.26]) greater in the least (vs most) socioeconomically advantaged areas. Residing in the least-moderate walkable areas was associated with higher GDM risk (1.08[95% CrI; 1.02, 1.14]) than most walk- able areas. Compared to areas with the least access to fast-food outlets (fourth quartile), other quartiles were associated with increased GDM risk, with the greatest in the highest access (first quartile) (1.12 [95% CrI; 1.04,1.20]). The access to fast food-GDM association was more amplified in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas (1.38 [1.17, 1.63]).

**Conclusion:**
GDM risk was associated with socioeconomic disadvan- tage, high concentrations of migrant women, least-moderate walkabil- ity, and highest fast-food access. Tailored population-level interven- tions targeting socioeconomic, ethnic, and built environment attributes may improve preventive health efforts and mitigate GDM risk.

**Background and aims:**
One of the objectives of the 1989 St. Vincent Declaration was to narrow rates of adverse perinatal outcomes between pregnant women with and without diabetes mellitus This study aimed to analyse: (i) prevalence of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with pre-gestational diabetes (DM) and gestational diabetes (GDM) compared to those without any DM and (ii) their time trends between 2004 and 2019 in Germany.

**Materials and methods:**
This study is based on data from legally prescribed quality assurance procedures (§136 of G-BA) to record all inpatient births in Germany. We included all singleton births dur- ing 2004-2019. DM was assumed if its diagnosis was documented in maternity records at the first screening. GDM was identified if it was coded in maternity records or as a discharge diagnosis ICD-10: O24.4. Information about maternal and neonatal outcomes was obtained from the maternity hospital inpatient records. We used log-binomial regres- sion to analyse the prevalence of outcomes and their time trends in pregnancies stratified by diabetes status and estimated prevalence ratios (PR), adjusted for maternal age and region. We compared the prevalence in 2008-2011, 2012-2015 and 2016-2019 with 2004-2007 as reference category.

**Results:**
Between 2004 and 2019, the overall prevalence of most mater- nal and neonatal outcomes was significantly higher in pregnancies complicated by DM than those without (amongst others stillbirth: PR: 2.28 [95% CI 2.11-2.47]; large for gestational age (LGA): 2.48 [2.45- 2.51]; premature birth: 2.02 [1.99-2.05]). In pregnancies with GDM most outcomes were more prevalent compared to pregnancies with- out DM, albeit with smaller PRs ranged between 1.14 and 1.64. The prevalence of maternal and neonatal outcomes significantly increased in pregnancies with DM between 2004-2007 and 2016-2019: stillbirth by 68%, LGA (9%), caesarean section (8%), and low Apgar score < 7 after 5 min (72%, p-values < 0.05 resp.) without significant change in the other outcomes. The prevalence also increased in pregnancies with GDM: low Apgar score (38%), caesarean section (2%) and small for gestational age (SGA) (7%, p < 0.05 resp.) but significantly decreased in premature birth by -22%, LGA (-14%), transfer to a children’s hos- pital (-20%) and malformations (-21%, p < 0.05 resp.). In pregnancies without DM, time trends were quite similar to those in pregnancies with GDM. During the study period the PR comparing pregnancies with DM to those without DM increased significantly for most out- comes (e.g. stillbirth 2004-2007: 1.90 [1.57-2.31]; 2016-2019: 2.76 [2.43-3.13] while the difference between pregnancies with GDM and without DM only increased significantly for SGA (2004-2007: 0.77 [0.75-0.79]; 2016-2019: 0.83 [0.82-0.84]).

**Conclusion:**
Our nationwide study of maternal and neonatal outcomes over 15 years found a higher prevalence of most complications of sin- gleton pregnancies affected by DM and GDM compared to pregnancies without DM, with particularly large differences for DM. No favourable temporal trends were identified in pregnancies with DM in the study period, whereas some improvement was observed in pregnancies with GDM and those without DM. The discrepancy between risk of mater- nal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies with DM and no DM even increased over time.

**Background and aims:**
The Japanese Society of Diabetes and Preg- nancy (JSDP) previously established a prospective registry system for pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The primary objectives of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Outcome for Mother and Baby (DREAMBee) study are to identify the charac- teristics of pregnancies complicated by glucose metabolism disor- ders in Japan, assess the long-term effects of these disorders on the prognosis of women and their offspring, and provide insights into improving perinatal outcomes and contribute to the prevention of diabetes in women and the next generation. The aim of this study was to elucidate risk factors associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in cases of early gestational diabetes mellitus (early-GDM).

**Materials and methods:**
A dataset of 385 early-GDM cases from a prospective cohort was analyzed. Early-GDM was diagnosed if one or more of the following criteria were met during a 75-g oral glu- cose tolerance test conducted before 20 weeks of gestation: fasting plasma glucose (PG) levels of 92-125 mg/dL, 1-hour PG levels ≥180 mg/dL, or 2-hour PG levels ≥153 mg/dL. Multivariate analysis was performed to examine associations between potential risk factors and a composite outcome of maternal and neonatal adverse events.

**Results:**
Pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity (defined as a pre-preg- nancy BMI ≥25.0 kg/m ) was significantly associated with a higher risk of the composite outcome compared with normal weight (pre- pregnancy BMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m ), with an adjusted risk ratio (aRR) of 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.93) and an adjusted risk difference (aRD) of 13.6% (95% CI: 2.6-24.6%). Addi- tionally, fasting PG levels between 95 and 125 mg/dL were associ- ated with a significantly increased risk of the composite outcome compared with levels below 92 mg/dL, with an aRR of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.01-1.99) and an aRD of 12.9% (95% CI: 0.3-25.5%).

**Conclusion:**
Early-GDM, when accompanied by pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and/or elevated fasting PG levels (95-125 mg/ dL), is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal out- comes. These cases should be prioritized for early intervention.

**Background and aims:**
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain South Asian individuals’ susceptibility to type 2 diabe- tes; however, the importance of the incretin hormones and glucagon are less clear. We aimed to assess and compare fasting levels and responses to an oral glucose tolerance test of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-independent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon in South Asian and Nordic women 1-3 years after a diag- nosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

**Materials and methods:**
We investigated differences in hormone responses in 178 South Asian and 107 Nordic women 16 months after GDM during an oral glucose tolerance test. Total levels of GLP-1, GIP and glucagon were measured by immunoassay. Based on measurements of glucose, insulin and C-peptide, we used the ISEC software to calculate prehepatic insulin levels. Hormone responses were assessed by linear mixed models and area under the curve (AUC). The glucose tolerance categories were based on the WHO- International Expert Committee criteria.

**Results:**
Compared to the Nordic group, South Asian women had higher fasting glucagon levels (p<0.001), 16% lower AUC for GIP (p<0.001) and 29% higher AUC for glucagon (p<0.001). Likewise, the peak GIP values were 12% lower (p=0.002) and nadir gluca- gon values 89% higher (p<0.001) in South Asian than in Nordic women (Fig.1). We found no ethnic differences in GLP-1 levels. We also found higher levels of AUC glucose (p=0.03), prehepatic insulin (p<0.001) and AUC of peripheral insulin (p<0.001) in South Asian compared to Nordic women. In women with normal glucose tolerance, we found 29% higher AUC for glucagon (p=0.013) and 63% higher nadir glucagon levels in South Asian vs Nordic women (p=0.012). The prediabetes/diabetes group showed similar patterns as the total population, except that we found no ethnic differences in AUC for glucagon (p=0.098).

**Conclusion:**
In women examined 1-3 years after a GDM pregnancy, South Asian women had higher fasting and post-OGTT glucagon lev- els, and lower post-OGTT GIP levels. These factors may be impor- tant for their susceptibility to develop future type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
To investigate tissue specific insulin resistance in South Asian and Nordic women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and evaluate for potential ethnic differences contribut- ing to type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk.

**Materials and methods:**
A cross-sectional study using a two-step hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (“low insulin” 10 and “high insulin” 40 mU/m /min) with [6,6-2H2] glucose tracer was conducted to assess insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue in 19 South Asian and 16 Nordic prediabetic women with previous GDM, along with 16 ethnic-specific controls. We assessed inflammation and mitochondrial function by mRNA sequencing of adipose tissue.

**Results:**
Both South Asian and Nordic women with previous GDM showed reduced total glucose disposal (mainly due to muscle insulin resistance) and hyperinsulinaemia compared to controls. Endogenous glucose production (mainly due to hepatic insulin resistance) was elevated in Nordics with previous GDM, in contrast to South Asians with previous GDM showed more pronounced adipose tissue insulin resistance (reduced suppression of glycerol during clamp). mRNA sequencing of adipose tissue indicated greater tissue inflammation in South Asian compared to Nordic women with previous GDM. Correlations between adiposity markers and insulin resistance differed by ethnicity, suggesting that the pathways leading to type 2 diabetes may vary across populations.

**Conclusion:**
South Asian and Nordic women with previous GDM seem to exhibit distinct insulin resistance profiles. South Asians with previ- ous GDM appear more prone to adipose tissue insulin resistance and inflammation than Nordics.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes is associated with poor preg- nancy outcomes, yet the role of both maternal and paternal socioeco- nomic status (SES) in modifying these risks remains understudied. This study investigates the association between parental SES and the risk of preterm delivery and extreme large for gestational age (LGA) infants in pregnancies with maternal type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
From the Danish nationwide registers, we included all pregnancies with maternal type 1 diabetes from 1997 to 2021. Outcomes were preterm delivery (before 37 weeks) and extreme LGA (birth weight ≥2SD above the mean, adjusted for sex and ges- tational age). Exposures included five measures of low SES: family relative poverty (family income below 50% of the median for the popu- lation the year prior to delivery), low education (primary school or less) for mother or father, and mother or father receiving cash or disability benefits. For each measure of low SES, we calculated relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of delivering preterm or extreme LGA infants using logistic regression models and regression stand- ardization. Models were adjusted for maternal birth year and parental immigration status.

**Results:**
5478 pregnancies from 3434 women were analyzed. The median maternal age was 30.8 years, and 7.5% of mothers and 10.3% of fathers were immigrants or descendants. 32.5% of deliveries were preterm, and 36% of infants were born extreme LGA. Relative poverty was present in 5.6% of the population, while 17.9 % of mothers and 18.9 % of fathers had low education, and 13.6% of mothers and 5.4% of fathers received cash or disability benefits. All measures of low SES were associated with a significantly increased risk of preterm delivery in the adjusted models (ranging from RR 1.24 (95% CI 1.03 to1.45) to 1.42 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.62)). Besides a significant reduction in the risk of extreme LGA when the mother (RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.98) or father (RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.98) received cash or disability benefits, no measure of low SES was associated with extreme LGA in the adjusted models (ranging from RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.0.84 to 1.05)) to 0.98 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.15)).

**Conclusion:**
Low SES was associated with a significantly increased risk of preterm delivery but not with extreme LGA. Studies evaluating the effect of tailored support to pregnant women with low SES are warranted.

**Background and aims:**
Globally, sugar intake from sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) exceeds the daily recommended limits for intake levels of free sugar. Artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) are now widely used to replace SSBs, but growing evidence suggests its asso- ciation with adverse health outcomes. In Australia, both SSBs and ASBs are consumed widely; however, there is a scarcity of local evi- dence regarding a risk following intake, especially with type 2 diabe- tes (T2DM). Hence, we aimed to assess the association of sweetened beverage intake (SSBs and ASBs) with the risk of T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) on 36,608 individuals aged 40 to 69 years were used. Participants were recruited between 1990 and 1994, with follow-ups conducted from 1994 to 1998 and from 2003 to 2007 and self-reported data on diabetes collected. We categorized the frequency of SSBs and ASBs consumption into four: never or <1 time/month; 1-3 per month; 1-6 times per week; >=1 time/day. The association of sweetened beverage intake with the incidence of T2DM was assessed using modified Poisson regression, adjusted for lifestyle, obesity, socio- economic, and other confounders.

**Results:**
Intakes of both SSBs and ASBs were associated with an increased risk of T2DM. A high intake (≥1 time/day) compared to a low intake (never or <1 time/month) was associated with increased risk of T2DM for SSB intake (incidence risk ratio (IRR) = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05-1.45; p for trend = 0.006) and for ASB intake (IRR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.18-1.61; p for trend < 0.001). Further adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and waist-to hip ratio (WHR) eliminated the association for SSBs, but not ASBs intake.

**Conclusion:**
Consumption of both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages was associated with increased risk of T2DM. These findings highlight the need for public health measures to control the intake of sweetened beverages.

**Background and aims:**
Four subtypes of type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been proposed, two severe (SIRD-severe insulin resistant diabetes, SIDD-severe insulin deficient diabetes) and two mild (MOD-mild obesity related diabetes and MARD-mild age related diabetes). We investigated whether the influence of smoking on T2D risk varied by subtype and explored interaction with genetic susceptibility to T2D, insulin resistance (IR), and insulin secretion (IS).

**Materials and methods:**
We used data from the Swedish case-control study ESTRID (2010-2024) and the Norwegian cohort study HUNT (1984-2008), covering 3325 incident T2D cases (495 SIDD, 477 SIRD, 693 MOD, 1660 MARD), 3897 controls, and 873,349 person-years of follow-up. We reproduced genetic risk scores (T2D-GRS, IS-GRS, IR-GRS). Odds ratios and hazard ratios were estimated using condi- tional logistic and Cox regression and pooled to yield relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Interaction between smoking and genetic susceptibility was assessed by proportion attributable to interaction (AP).

**Results:**
Ever vs. never smokers were at increased risk of SIRD (RR 2.17 [CI 1.65-2.86]), while the association was weaker for SIDD (RR 1.21 [CI 0.99-1.49]), MOD (RR 1.30, [CI 1.07-1.58]) and MARD (RR 1.31 [CI 1.16-1.48]). Heavy smokers (≥15 pack-years vs. never smok- ing) had an increased risk for all subtypes (SIRD RR 2.40 [CI 1.76- 3.29], SIDD RR 1.54 [CI 1.20-1.97], MOD RR 1.55 [CI 1.20-1.99] and MARD RR 1.48 [CI 1.27-1.72]). There was evidence of additive interaction between heavy smoking and T2D-GRS and IS-GRS, but not IR-GRS, on the risk of both SIDD and SIRD (Table 1).

**Conclusion:**
Heavy smoking confers a higher risk of T2D whether it is characterized by insulin resistance, insulin deficiency, obesity, or high age. The association was strongest for SIRD which supports that the link between smoking and T2D involves adverse effects on insulin sensitivity. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to T2D or insulin deficiency appear particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of smoking. These findings underscore the importance of smoking cessation in the prevention of T2D.

5. Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, Department of Public Health, School

**Background and aims:**
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects glu- cose metabolism and increases diabetes risk; HBV vaccination may reduce this risk. The role of HBV immunity in diabetes prevention among individuals without HBV infection is underexplored. To evalu- ate whether HBV immunity reduces diabetes risk in individuals without HBV infection.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective cohort study used deidenti- fied electronic medical records from TriNetX. Adults with hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) results without a history of HBV infection or diabetes were identified. Diabetes was defined on the basis of a diabetes diagnosis, diabetes medication use, or glycated hemoglobin ≥6.5%. Propensity score matching was conducted to balance demographics and comorbidities between groups.

**Results:**
The HBV-immunized group had a 15% lower diabetes risk than did the HBV-unimmunized group (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.84-0.87). A dose-response effect was observed, with higher diabetes protection at higher HBsAb levels. HBsAb levels of ≥100 and ≥1000 mIU/mL were associated with 19% and 43% reductions in diabetes risk, respectively, compared with HBsAb <10 mIU/mL. The diabetes protective effect was associated with age. Immunized individuals aged 18 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, and ≥65 years had 20%, 11%, and 12% lower diabetes risks, respectively, compared with unimmunized individuals.

**Conclusion:**
HBV immunity may provide protection against diabetes, suggesting broader HBV vaccination as a dual-benefit strategy for the prevention of hepatitis B and diabetes, especially in regions with a high prevalence of both diseases.

**Background and aims:**
The impact of antiepileptic drug use on the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) has not been clearly established. We investigated whether antiepileptic drug use increases the risk of NODM using a national cohort.

**Materials and methods:**
This study was a retrospective, observational study that used data from the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening cohort database. Total 161,070 individuals (1,593 antiepileptic drug (AED) users and 159,477 non-users) were included. Using ATC codes, AED users were defined as those who were prescribed AED for more than 30 days during the inclusion period (2004-2008). NODM was defined as a record of diabetes diagnosis (ICD-10 code E11-14) and pre- scription of one or more anti-diabetic drugs. A Cox proportional hazards model was performed to estimate the hazard ratios for NODM risk. To compare DM-free survival, we used Kaplan-Meier estimates with the log-rank test.

**Results:**
The average follow-up period for the AED users was 11.5 ± 3.5 years, and for non-users it was 9.6 ± 2.9 years. The hazard ratios (HRs; 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for NODM risk was 1.094 (1.011-1.195) in non-adjusted model. After age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, glucose, economic status adjustment and with the non-users as the reference, estimates of HR for NODM was 1.105 (1.012-1.208). The difference between the survival curves between the two groups was shown to have a P-value < 0.05 in the log-rank test.

**Conclusion:**
In this study, the AED usage was positively associated with NODM risk in middle-aged individuals aged 50 years and older. Therefore, it is suggested that glucose monitoring may be necessary for individuals using AEDs.

**Background and aims:**
Increased small dense low-density lipopro- tein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) levels are associated with insulin resist- ance which leads to glucose intolerance. However, it remains unclear whether calculated sdLDL-C levels can predict the future onset of dia- betes regardless of low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.

**Materials and methods:**
Among 28,990 Japanese individuals who received health checkups in 2006, this retrospective cohort study included 17,290 subjects (men/women: 10,936/6,354) who did not have diabetes, had triglyceride levels <800 mg/dL, had no missing data, and had undergone health checkups at least once until 2017. Subjects were categorized into 4 groups based on sdLDL-C and LDL-C levels determined using the Sampson’s equation in 2006 as follows: high (H)-sdLDL-C/H-LDL-C, H-sdLDL-C/low (L)-LDL-C, L-sdLDL-C/H- LDL-C, and L-sdLDL-C/L-LDL-C, with cut-off value of 34.7 mg/dL for sdLDL-C and 112.8 mg/dL for LDL-C, which were determined by ROC analysis.

**Results:**
A total 902 subjects newly developed diabetes over 10-year observation period. The cumulative incidences for the onset of diabetes among the 4 groups divided by sdLDL-C and LDL-C were significantly different (Log-rank test, p<0.001) and the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) in the H-sdLDL-C/L-LDL-C group (HR: 1.35 [95% confidence inter- val {CI}: 1.03-1.77]) and in the H-sdLDL-C/H-LDL-C group (HR: 1.46 [95% CI: 1.21-1.77]) were significantly higher than that in the L-sdLDL-C/L-LDL-C group as a reference. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a dose-dependent relationship between sdLDL-C lev- els and the risk of diabetes, whereas LDL-C levels did not show such relationship with the development of diabetes. Furthermore, the inclu- sion of the information of sdLDL-C/LDL-C groups into traditional risk factors including age, sex, fasting glucose levels, family history of diabetes, obesity, smoking habit, and alcohol drinking habit signifi- cantly improved the discriminatory capability for predicting diabetes (Category-free net reclassification improvement: 0.396, p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
The findings indicate that calculated sdLDL-C levels can predict the future onset of diabetes irrespective of LDL-C levels in Japanese general population.

**Background and aims:**
Ambient air pollution (AP) has been linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study examines the association between long-term AP exposure and T2D prevalence in Italy from 2006 to 2023.

**Materials and methods:**
The correlation between T2D prevalence, AP exposure, and health-related determinants (BMI, household members, smoking, education level, income, exercise, daily con- sumption of pasta, bread, and vegetables) was assessed using multi- ple linear and stepwise regression models. Simulations were run with three predictor configurations: 1) health-related indicators only, 2) AP only, 3) both. The AP considered are nitrogen oxide (NO), nitro- gen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), formaldehyde (HCHO), carbon mon- oxide (CO), nitric acid (HNO3), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), isoprene (C5H8), hydroxyl radical (OH), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), temperature, and water vapor content. T2D prevalence, health, and socioeconomic data were pro- vided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). AP data were acquired from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) using the ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4 (EAC4) dataset (REF EA1).

**Results:**
T2D prevalence increased from 4.4% in 2006 to over 6% in 2023. Figure 1 shows measured diabetes prevalence in Italy and three model simulations. Using only health-related indicators, the linear regression model reproduced measurements with R of 0.9444, identifying education level as the most significant predictor. Using only AP, the correlation coefficient between modeled and observed T2D prevalence increased to 0.9993, suggesting AP significantly improve trend description. The stepwise model identified NO2 as the most relevant predictor. When considering both health-related indicators and AP, model performance improved (R = 0.9997), with C2H6 as the most relevant predictor.

**Conclusion:**
Exposure to NO2 and C2H6 shows a strong association with rising T2D prevalence in Italy, outperforming health-related predictors. Air pollution thus emerges as a key determinant of the national diabetes burden.

**Background and aims:**
Cannabis use is increasing globally, yet its long-term metabolic effects remain unclear. Some studies have sug- gested potential anti-inflammatory or weight-modulating properties, while others raise concerns regarding glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between cannabis use and the risk of developing diabetes mellitus (DM) in a large, real-world population using electronic health record data.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network, including data from 54 healthcare organizations. Adults (≥18 years) with cannabis-related ICD-10 diagno- ses between 2010 and 2018 were identified as the exposed cohort (Cohort A). A comparator group of healthy individuals with no substance use or major chronic conditions was selected (Cohort B). Propensity score matching (1:1) was applied to balance covariates including age, sex, and baseline comorbidities. The primary outcome was the new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (ICD-10 codes E08-E13) within 5 years after the index outpatient visit. Risk ratios, odds ratios, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare outcomes between cohorts.

**Results:**
DM incidence was significantly higher in the cannabis cohort (2.2%) compared to the healthy cohort (0.6%). The risk difference was 1.6% (95% CI: 1.5-1.8%, z = 28.845, p < 0.0001). The risk ratio was 3.739 (95% CI: 3.395-4.118), and the odds ratio was 3.802 (95% CI: 3.449-4.191), indicating that cannabis users had nearly 4 times the risk of developing DM. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a lower diabetes- free survival in cannabis users (96.82%) versus controls (99.15%) over 5 years. The log-rank test was highly significant ( ² = 1112.03, p < 0.0001), and the hazard ratio for developing DM in cannabis users was 4.532 (95% CI: 4.111-4.995).

**Conclusion:**
Cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus over a 5-year period. These findings sug- gest the need for metabolic monitoring and further research into the long-term endocrine effects of cannabis use.

**Background and aims:**
Despite growing interest, the relationship between various components of physical fitness, such as muscular endurance, flexibility, and postural control, and the risk of incident type 2 diabetes remains insufficiently understood. Therefore, we inves- tigated the association between various components of physical fitness and the risk of incident type 2 diabetes in a prospective cohort study of middle-aged Japanese men.

**Materials and methods:**
Study population was 5,683 Japanese men aged 35 to 57 years without diabetes at baseline. Physical fitness assess- ments included abdominal muscular endurance (sit-up test: assessed by counting the number of sit-ups performed with hands behind the head and knees bent at 90 degrees), lower limb muscular endurance (prone leg lift test: participants lie in the prone position, lift both legs, and the duration of the held position is measured), flexibility (sit-and-reach test: participants sit with legs extended and reach forward to measure the maximum reach distance), and balance ability (balance test: measured as the duration for which participants can maintain a standing posture on a balancing platform). All physical fitness measures, except for the prone leg lift, were categorized into quartiles. For the prone leg lift, 38% of participants maintained the position for the full 120 seconds. The remain- ing participants were divided into tertiles, resulting in four categories for analysis. Type 2 diabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose level ≥126 mg/dL or the use of glucose-lowering medications. Discrete-time logit models were used to examine the association between baseline these physical fitness levels and the risk of type 2 diabetes.

**Results:**
During the 6-year follow-up, 424 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Higher abdominal muscular endurance and better balance ability were significantly associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes, whereas flexibility and lower limb muscular endurance were not after adjustment for age, daily alcohol consumption, smok- ing status, regular physical exercise, family history of diabetes, and BMI. For abdominal muscular endurance, multiple-adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for type 2 diabetes were 1.04 (0.82-1.34), 0.99 (0.76-1.29), and 0.64 (0.45-0.90) for quartiles 2, 3, and 4 of the number of sit-ups, respectively, compared with quartile 1 (P for trend =0.027). For bal- ance ability, the corresponding odds ratios were 0.74 (0.57-0.95), 0.89 (0.68-1.15), and 0.68 (0.50-0.92) for categories 2, 3, and 4 of balance duration, respectively, compared with category 1 (P for trend = 0.029).

**Conclusion:**
Higher abdominal muscular endurance and better balance ability were associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

2. pore, Singapore, Department of Endocrinology, Singapore General

**Background and aims:**
The legacy effect in diabetes refers to long- term adverse outcomes resulting from prior exposure to hyperglyce- mia. Although well established, no widely adopted metric currently quantifies cumulative historical glycemic exposure. We developed and evaluated the average-area-under-the-HbA1c-curve (AAUHC), a novel time-weighted metric designed to capture an individual’s long-term glycemic burden.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a registry-based cohort study utilizing data from the Singapore Health Services Diabetes Registry (SDR) spanning from 2019 to 2023. For each patient, AAUHC was computed using the trapezoidal rule with non-uniform intervals over multiple 5-year periods. AAUHC values were then categorized into six groups in increments of 1.0% (5.5 mmol/mol). Logistic regression models were employed to evaluate associations between AAUHC and ten diabetes-related outcomes. Separate analytical models were devel- oped to assess the effects of historical glycemic control over distinct 10- and 20-year timeframes.

**Results:**
Models evaluating 10-year glycemic control included 60,047-80,416 individuals, whereas those assessing 20-year periods encompassed 20,142-27,010 patients. The vast majority (>98.5%) had type 2 diabetes. We observed a dose-dependent relationship between AAUHC and the odds ratios (ORs) for diabetes-related outcomes, with distinct patterns varying by duration of glycemic exposure. For expo- sure periods of ≥5 years, higher AAUHC categories (≥8.0% [≥63.9 mmol/mol]) demonstrated a linear association with increased ORs for all outcomes except ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Conversely, during the recent 0-5-year period, the relationship exhibited a J-shaped pattern, where both high (≥8.0% [≥63.9 mmol/mol]) and low (<6.0% [<42.1 mmol/mol]) AAUHC categories showed increased ORs rela- tive to the reference category (6.0-7.0% [42.1-53.0 mmol/mol]). Our analyses also revealed that higher AAUHC categories (≥9.0% [≥74.9 mmol/mol]) from earlier historical periods (>5 years prior) were asso- ciated with greater ORs compared to more recent periods (<5 years) for acute myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, major and minor lower-extremity amputations, chronic kidney disease stages G4 and G5, and all-cause mortality, thus highlighting the legacy effect of diabetes.

**Conclusion:**
We validated the novel AAUHC metric, confirming previ- ous observations of the legacy effect in diabetes. Maintaining HbA1c levels within the 6.0-8.0% (42.1-63.9 mmol/mol) range throughout the disease course is crucial for reducing diabetic complications and mortality. Integrating AAUHC into clinical workflows and population health initiatives may enhance risk stratification, facilitate personalized treatment strategies, and significantly reduce the diabetes burden at individual and healthcare system levels.

**Phenotype-based clustering identifies a novel diabetes subtype among Chinese individuals with type 2 diabetes predicting car- diovascular-kidney complications**

H. Lin, H. Wu, A.P.S. Kong, E.Y.K. Chow, R. Ozaki, A.O.Y. Luk, J.C.N., Chan, R.C.W. Ma

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes is heterogeneous and recent studies have discovered several subgroups basing on clinical char- acteristics, and revealed their prognostic significance. In this study, we aim to use clinical variables to identify subtypes among Chinese individuals with diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed two independent cohorts comprising 6,582 Chinese adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (Hong Kong Diabetes Register [HKDR: 1995-2019] n=4,813, as the discovery cohort, and Hong Kong Diabetes Biobank [HKDB: 2014-2019] n=1,769, as the replication cohort. All individuals in the HKDR were clustered based on age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), high-density lipoprotein cho- lesterol (HDL-C), and fasting C-peptide (CP) levels. Clusters were defined using the k-means algorithm in R, with stratification by sex. Then validated the clustering methodology by repeating the analyses using the HKDB replication cohort and matched the cluster assign- ments with the HKDR discovery cohort through Euclidean distance. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to predict incidence of clinical outcomes in each subgroup with adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

**Results:**
In the HKDR cohort, the mean age was 56.0 ± 13.9 years, with 55.2% of the participants being male. The age at diagnosis was 48.8 ± 13.3 years, with a disease duration of 7.1 ± 7.0 years, BMI of 25.4 ± 4. 1kg/m², HbA1c of 7.6 ± 1.7%, and C-peptide of 508.9 ± 389. 6pmol/L. We replicated previously reported subgroups of severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), severe insulin-resistant dia- betes (SIRD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), mild age-related diabetes (MARD), and mild diabetes with high HDL-cholesterol (MDH). We identified a novel diabetes subgroup, severe hypergly- cemic diabetes (SHD), characterized by young onset (43.6±11.6 years), long diabetes duration (8.7±7.5 years), severe hyperglyce- mia HbA1c (10.5±1.4%) and low CP (383.9±281.7pmol/l). All six subgroups were replicated in the HKDB. After a mean follow-up of 14.6 years, the SH subgroup in the HKDR had higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD including ischaemic heart disease (IHD), stroke and peripheral vascular disease (PVD), heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage kidney disease (ESKD) and all-cause mortality versus the SIDD group, adjusted for sex, baseline age, blood pressure, eGFR and insulin use. In HKDB with shorter follow-up of 3.4 years, we replicated significant higher incidence of CVD and HF in SHD.

**Conclusion:**
This study replicates the clinical and prognostic rel- evance of phenotype-based clustering in Chinese individuals with type 2 diabetes. A novel subgroup with younger age of diagnosis and worse prognosis was identified.

**Background and aims:**
People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have an elevated risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carci- noma (HCC). European guidelines recommend screening for liver dis- ease in people with T2D, but the costs and benefits depend on the preva- lence and incidence of liver disease. We examined the incidence of liver disease in a nationwide cohort of individuals with newly diagnosed T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
We included participants with newly diag- nosed T2D enrolled in the Danish Center for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2) cohort from 2010-2023. We used nation- wide health registers to follow participants from cohort inclusion to incident hospital diagnosis for any liver disease (ICD-10 K70-K77, HCC, ascites, or esophageal varices), alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), unspecified cirrhosis, and MASLD. We computed incidence rates (IR) and cumulative incidence overall and for subgroups.

**Results:**
The study included 11,369 people with newly diagnosed T2D. We excluded 358 (3.1%) with prevalent liver disease, leaving 11,011 eligible for follow-up (median T2D duration 1.3 years, median age 61.4 years, 41.2% female). The median BMI was 30.8 kg/m and 5.7% reported a high alco- hol intake. During a median follow-up of 7.9 years (IQR 3.3-10.0 years), 333 people were diagnosed with any liver disease, yielding an IR of 4.5 per 1,000 person years and a 10-year risk of 4.2% (Table 1). The 10-year risks were 0.7% for ALD, 0.8% for unspecified cirrhosis, and 1.1% for MASLD. For people with a BMI >30 kg/m compared to BMI <30 kg/m , the 10-year risks were doubled for unspecified cirrhosis (1.0% vs. 0.5%) and for MASLD (1.2% vs. 0.7%). Similarly, people with high alcohol intake had a doubled 10-year incidence of any liver disease (7.5% vs. 3.9%) compared to those with a lower alcohol intake.

**Conclusion:**
The long-term incidence of any liver disease in this cohort of people with T2D was low, reflecting that the potential benefit of routine screening for liver diseases in T2D may be limited. People with overweight or high alcohol intake had a higher risk of liver disease, suggesting that these people may benefit the most from screening.

**Background and aims:**
Overweight and obesity increase risks of mul- tiple comorbidities and complications. Understanding the prevalence of such comorbidities across geographies and subgroups may provide insight into disease burden to facilitate policy and clinical decision- making, particularly given recent progress in obesity treatment options. We use contemporary data to characterise people with overweight or obesity in the US and Japan, and prevalence and overlap of cardiorenal comorbidities, stratified by presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

**Materials and methods:**
This analysis within the observational CALOR study program used data from the US (Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart; capturing administrative health claims from both inpatient and outpatient care for members of large commercial and Medicare Advantage health plans) and Japan (Medical Data Vision; capturing health claims from hospital care). The study population included people with recorded BMI ≥25 kg/m and/or obesity diag- nosis (ICD-9 278.0; ICD-10 E66) between 2022 and 2024. Prevalence of diagnosed chronic kidney disease, heart failure, hypertension and dyslipidaemia were described overall and stratified by T2D. Treatment patterns by presence of comorbidities are being investigated.

**Results:**
The US cohort included 5,692,262 people with recorded over- weight or obesity: median age 68.9 yrs, 55.6% female, median BMI 30.2 kg/m . In people with (37.6%) vs without (62.4%) T2D, median age was 71.4 vs 67.4 yrs, 53.2% vs 57.0% were female, and median BMI was 31.3 vs 29.5 kg/m . The prevalence of cardiorenal comor- bidities was high, and consistently higher in people with vs without T2D (Fig); overall, 88% had ≥1 comorbidity (99% vs 81%). The Japan cohort included 1,185,119 people: median age 68.0 yrs, 44.9% female, median BMI 27.2 kg/m . In people with (37.4%) vs without (62.6%) T2D, median age was 71.0 vs 66.0 yrs, 39.5% vs 48.1% were female, and median BMI was 27.3 vs 27.1 kg/m . Like in the US, the preva- lence of cardiorenal comorbidities was high, and consistently higher in people with vs without T2D (Fig). The extent of overlapping car- diorenal comorbidities was also higher in those with T2D (not shown).

**Conclusion:**
The prevalence of T2D and cardiorenal comorbidities is substantial in people with recorded overweight or obesity in the US and Japan, with significantly higher comorbidity occurrence among people with vs without T2D. These contemporary data highlight the importance of managing underlying disease, risk factors and comor- bidities in these populations.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, is a major gateway to the development of many chronic diseases. Contemporary population-based data on the national burden of MetS and its relation to socioeconomic inequalities are scarce. We inves- tigated the prevalence of MetS and its components in middle-aged Danes.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a prevalence study based on the new Danish Better Health in Late Life survey cohort. The cohort consists of randomly selected Danish residents who were aged 50 to 65 in 2021. Participants completed a survey on behavioral factors, psychological health, and self-reported measurements of height, weight, and waist and hip circumference. Their data were linked to nationwide registries containing laboratory biomarkers, drug prescriptions, comorbidities, and socioeconomic factors. We defined MetS according to the harmonized definition developed by the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Asso- ciation/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. We calculated the prevalence of MetS and its components in socioeconomic subgroups and examined characteristics of persons with and without MetS.

**Results:**
Among 50,694 middle-aged Danes, the prevalence of MetS was 24%. Its prevalence was higher among males than females (27% vs. 22%) and increased substantially with age, e.g., affecting 16% of persons aged 50-55 years and 31% of persons aged 61-66 years. Two-thirds of middle-aged persons had at least one of the five MetS components, i.e., abdominal obesity (42%), hypertension (37%), elevated triglycerides (30%), low HDL cholesterol (22%), and ele- vated glucose (20%). MetS showed a strong socioeconomic gradient, with almost twofold higher MetS prevalence in persons with low vs. high education (35% vs. 19%), low vs. high income (32% vs. 19%), and being outside the workforce vs. employed (43% vs. 22%). MetS increased sharply with BMI, from 11% in normal weight persons (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m ) to 49% in those with obesity grade I (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m ) and 62% in those with obesity grade II (BMI ≥35 kg/m ) (Figure). MetS prevalence was very high in persons with prediabetes (67%) and diabetes (88%) (Figure). Compared to persons without MetS, those with MetS more often had poor self-reported health (26% vs. 9%) and high perceived stress (median score: 11 vs. 9). Persons with MetS more often had a hospital history of cardio- vascular disease (17% vs. 2%) and cancer (8% vs. 6%), and far more often used statins (59% vs. 2%), antihypertensives (66% vs. 13%), and antidepressants (15% vs. 6%).

**Conclusion:**
Among middle-aged Danes, the prevalence of MetS and its components was high, with a strong socioeconomic gradient. MetS was closely related to psychosocial stressors and comorbidities.

**Background and aims:**
Foot complications (FC) in diabetes are com- mon and costly. Most of our knowledge of FC is based on studies of people with long-standing type-2 diabetes (T2D). However, some may have foot and vascular complications already around time of T2D diag- nosis, as metabolic dysfunction may have been present for many years. The association of early-onset FC with socio-economic inequalities and comorbidities like chronic pain remains unexplored. We aimed to examine the prevalence of early-onset FC in adults with newly diag- nosed T2D and association with socioeconomic factors and pain.

**Materials and methods:**
The study used a prospective clinical cohort of 10,112 T2D individuals (median T2D duration 1 y) from the Danish DD2 database 2010-2021, linked to extensive Danish National Health Registers. Prevalent FC were defined as a history of foot ulcers/infec- tions before cohort enrolment, registered by ICD-10 diagnosis codes: E105B, E115B, E125B, E135B, E145B, E105C, E115C, E125C, E135C, E145C, L024A, L024J, L024M, L97, R02, S91, and surgical procedure codes: KQDA10, KQDB (- KQDB00), KQDG, KNHS; or Charcot’s foot: M142, M145, M146, M148. Descriptive statistics were used to report the prevalence of FC and associated baseline character- istics. We calculated age- and sex-adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of FC using a log-binomial model.

**Results:**
In total, 7.5% (n=756) of the recently diagnosed T2D patients had a history of FC. Among patients with vs. without FC, age was similar (60 vs 61y) while more patients with FC were men (64% vs 58%) and more (26% vs 20%) received social welfare. The prevalence of chronic pain conditions was remarkably high in those with FC, i.e. nonspecific pain: 40% vs. 29%; arthritis pain: 32% vs. 21%, and back/ spine pain: 13% vs. 9%. Other early-onset diabetes-related compli- cations were also more frequent, including neuropathy (12% vs 7%), eye disease (12% vs 7%), ischemic heart disease (15% vs 13%), heart failure (6% vs 4%), and kidney disease (4% vs 2%). After adjustment for age and sex, a household income in the lowest tertile (€ <45327) compared to the highest tertile (€ >79082) was associated with higher prevalence of FC [aPR: 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.54), as was receiving social welfare compared to being employed [aPR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.17-1.68], being male [aPR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.10-1.47], and divorced [aPR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.07-1.54] or single/unmarried [aPR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.02-1.51], both compared to being married. Chronic pain conditions were strongly associated with FC, including rheumato- logical/arthritic pain [aPR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.37-1.80], neuropathic pain [aPR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.21-1.82], headache, back-, fracture-, or morbid pain [aPR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.78-2.41], and non-specific pain, CRPS, or fibromyalgia [aPR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.37-1.81].

**Conclusion:**
One out of 13 newly diagnosed people with T2D had a history of FC around T2D diagnosis. There was a clear association of early-onset FC with socio-economic disparities and with chronic pain conditions. Our findings suggest an increased awareness of early prevention of FC is needed.

2. London, London, UK, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen

**Background and aims:**
This study examines sex-based differences in associations of risk factors with micro- and macro-vascular complica- tions in individuals with early (diagnosed <40 years) and usual onset (diagnosed ≥40 years) Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) using Clinical Practice Research Datalink.

**Materials and methods:**
We assessed sex differences in clinical, socio-demographic risk factors, history of comorbidities and the use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications measured at diag- nosis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate men-to- women ratio of HRs (RHR) with 95% CI for risk factors of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy as well as myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure (MACE) at both early and usual onset.

**Results:**
In total, 430,872 (56.3% men; median age 61 years) partici- pants were diagnosed with T2D, with 5.6% diagnosed with early onset T2D. During a median follow-up period of 6 years (5 years for early and 6 years for late onset), 29.0% of participants developed retinopa- thy, 13.4% nephropathy, 3.6% neuropathy and 11.6% MACE. Sex was not significantly associated with micro or macrovascular outcomes in early onset T2D. Among participants with usual onset T2D, men had a significantly higher risk of retinopathy (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.56- 2.27) and MACE (HR 3.66, 95% CI 2.72-4.93) compared to women. For retinopathy, a higher BMI was associated with a lower hazard in men compared to women in both early onset T2D (0.99, 0.98-0.99) and usual onset T2D (0.99, 0.99-0.99). In usual onset T2D, older age at diagnosis (0.99, 0.99-0.99) and South Asian ethnicity 0.93, 0.89- 0.98) were also linked to a lower risk in men. In contrast, higher HDL was associated with a greater hazard ratio in men compared to women (1.07, 1.03-1.11). In early onset T2D, men using statins had a lower risk of nephropathy compared to women (0.54, 95% CI 0.35-0.82). In usual onset T2D, Black (1.22, 1.12-1.34), Other Asian (1.33, 1.14- 1.54), or South Asian (1.13, 1.04-1.23) ethnic groups were associated with a higher risk of nephropathy in men compared to women. In con- trast, higher BMI (0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00), HDL (0.92, 0.87-0.97), and statin use (0.91, 0.88-0.95) were associated with a lower risk in men compared to women. For neuropathy, sex differences were found at usual onset T2D only. Black (0.76, 0.63-0.91) or South Asian (0.72, 0.61-0.84) ethnic groups, as well as those who were on statins at diag- nosis (0.89, 0.83-0.95) had significantly lower risk of neuropathy in men compared to women in the same group. For MACE, we observed significant sex differences in risk factors among participants with usual onset T2D only. In men compared to women, the following factors were associated with a lower risk of MACE: age at T2D diagnosis (0.99, 0.99-0.99), being in the least deprived IMD group (0.89, 0.84-0.95), and HDL level (0.91, 0.85-0.96). Conversely, higher total cholesterol (1.04, 1.02-1.05) and a history of post-traumatic stress or stress related disorder (1.10, 1.03-1.17) were associated with an increased risk of MACE in men compared to women.

**Conclusion:**
Different patterns of sex differences were observed across sexes at usual and early onset, with greater differences found at usual onset. This suggests targeting sex specific modifiable factors might help in preventing diabetes-related complications.

**Global, regional and national burden of core components in car- diovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021**

D. Lin

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syn- drome refers to a complex clinical syndrome encompassing multi-organ diseases caused by pathophysiological interactions among cardiovas- cular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic disorders. Based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, this study evaluates the epidemiological burden and regional variations of core components related to CKM, aiming to reveal the interconnections among these core components.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from GBD 2021 were extracted to include the incidence, mortality, prevalence, years lived with disabil- ity (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of core com- ponents of CKM syndrome: five metabolic risk factors (high fasting plasma glucose, high LDL cholesterol, high systolic blood pressure, high BMI, and kidney dysfunction), seven core diseases (ischemic heart disease, stroke, hypertensive heart disease, type 2 diabetes mel- litus, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation and flutter, and lower extremity peripheral arterial disease), and one impairment (heart fail- ure). Age-standardized rates were used to analyze trends from 1990 to 2021, with comparisons stratified by sex, age, region, and socio- demographic index (SDI). The BAPC model was employed to predict future disease burden.

**Results:**
In 2021, high systolic blood pressure emerged as the meta- bolic risk factor with the highest global burden (DALYs rate= 2,642.87 per 100,000 persons-year, 95% UI: 2,235.15-3,035.16), while ischemic heart disease ranked as the CKM syndrome-related core disease with the highest burden (DALYs rate= 2,212.16 per 100,000 persons-year, 95% UI: 2,075.54-2,327.61). The absolute number of total DALYs attributable to metabolic factors for CKM syndrome-related core dis- eases increased from 229 millions in 1990 to 406 millions in 2021. However, the total DALYs rate declined from 5,932.01 to 4,761.28 per 100,000 persons-year, with an estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of -0.83% (95% CI: -0.87 to -0.78%). The burden was sig- nificantly higher in males than females, with a slower rate of decline in males. High-SDI regions exhibited the lowest total DALYs rate (2,625.37 per 100,000 persons-year) and the largest absolute EAPC decline (-1.92%, 95% CI: -2.06 to -1.78%), whereas low-middle SDI regions showed an upward trend (EAPC = 0.10%, 95% CI: 0.07- 0.13%). Total DALYs rates also increased in Oceania, South Asia, and Southern Sub-Saharan Africa. The BAPC model projected that the total DALYs rate would decline to 4,667.59 per 100,000 persons-year (95% UI: 1,213.47-8,121.72) by 2050. In 2021, heart failure caused by ischemic heart disease had the highest YLDs rate among CKM syn- drome-related core diseases (20.43 per 100,000 per 100,000 persons- year, 95% UI: 13.55-28.7), with a persistent rise during 1990-2021 (EAPC = 0.10%, 95% CI: 0.07-0.14%). Only heart failure attributable to stroke showed a declining YLDs trend over this period (EAPC = -0.26%, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.19%).

**Conclusion:**
Core components of CKM syndrome constitute a signifi- cant portion of the global disease burden. Close interconnections exist between metabolic risk factors and CKM-related core diseases, as well as between these core diseases and heart failure. The disease burden continues to escalate in low- and middle-SDI regions, necessitating prioritized control of metabolic risk factors and the advancement of integrated interdisciplinary prevention and treatment strategies.

**Longitudinal study of diabetes and depressive symptoms in middle- aged and older adults in China: the mediating impact of functional limitations and social interaction**

Y. Tao

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes and depressive symptoms fre- quently coexist, with potential bidirectional influences. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study examines their longitudinal association and explores the mediating roles of functional limitations and social interaction to inform targeted interventions.

**Materials and methods:**
Data were drawn from 6,606 participants aged ≥45 years in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study across three waves: 2013 (T1), 2015 (T2), and 2018 (T3). Cross-lagged panel model analyses tested the reciprocal, prospective associations between diabetes and depressive symptoms, as well as the mediating effects of functional limitations and social interaction.

**Results:**
The mean age of 6,606 participants was 57.61 (±8.24) years, with 60.6% aged 45-59 years. The prevalence of depression among those with diabetes was 40.5% at T1, 42.1% at T2, and 40.4% at T3. Cross-lagged panel models showed that diabetes at T1 signifi- cantly predicted depressive symptoms at T2 (β = 1.027, < 0.001) and T3 (β = 1.045, < 0.05), while T2 diabetes did not predict T3 depressive symptoms (β = 0.464, > 0.05). Similarly, T1 depres- sive symptoms significantly predicted increased diabetes risk at T2 (β = 0.001, < 0.001), but T2 depressive symptoms did not pre- dict T3 diabetes (β = 0.001, > 0.05), suggesting a bidirectional relationship in the earlier stage and weakened over time. T1 dia- betes was associated with increased T2 functional limitations and reduced T2 social interaction, which in turn predicted higher T3 depressive symptoms. Bootstrap analysis confirmed significant indi- rect effects through functional limitations (ab = 0.077, = 0.015, 95% CI [0.025, 0.129]) and social interaction (ab = 0.028, = 0.013, 95% CI [0.009, 0.047]). However, no significant indirect effects of T1 depressive symptoms on T3 diabetes through these mediators were found (functional limitations: ab = 0.000, = 0.012, 95% CI [0.000, 0.000]; social interaction: ab = 0.000, = 0.019, 95% CI [0.000, 0.000]).

**Conclusion:**
Diabetes and depressive symptoms exhibit a reciprocal relationship, particularly in the earlier disease stages. Diversified inter- ventions aimed at maintaining physical function and social engagement may help reduce comorbidity risk.

**Background and aims:**
The Type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) man- agement landscape in France has evolved over the past decade with new technologies and treatments like CGM and SGLT2i, and new data showing long-term benefits of GLP1-RA therapies. This study provides an update on the T2DM burden in France considering these advancements.

**Materials and methods:**
This descriptive, retrospective, cross-sec- tional study analysed a representative sample of T2DM adult gener- ated from the French ESND claims database, which is a 2% repre- sentative sample of about 95% of the total population. Patients were identified by hypoglycaemic drug reimbursement, long-term disease, or hospital diagnoses ICD-10 codes. A control group of non-diabetes patients (1:3 ratio) was matched using a propensity score includ- ing age, sex, geography, health coverage, social deprivation index, and diabetes unrelated cancer presence (2017-2021). The analysis described the socio-demographic, clinical characteristics, and treat- ment lines of T2DM in 2022. Results were compared to similar data previously generated in 2013.

**Results:**
A total of 80,127 T2DM patients and 237,607 controls were identified. Among T2DM patients, 55.3% were men, with a mean age of 68.4 ±12.9 years and 85% had a long-term disease code related to diabetes for a mean period of time of 9.5 years. The incidence of hospital stays for coronary revascularization, unstable angina pectoris, transient ischemic attack, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, arteriopathy of the lower limbs, lower limb amputation and end-stage renal failure were respectively 3.8%, 0.9%, 0.6%, 2.5%, 2.4%, 2.1%, 1.8%, 0.5%, and 3.0% in the T2DM cohort. The standardized relative risks of macro and microvascular complications were higher in the T2DM group. Compared to the 2013 data, the distribution of patients across treatment lines was consistent, counting 40% on monotherapy, 24.8% on bi-therapy, 13% on triple therapy, and 20.3% on insulin (including 11.2% on basal insulin). SGLT2i were prescribed in 9.9% of patients, GLP1-RA in 17%, CGM in 5.6% respectively. 65% of patients maintained the same pharmaceutical treatment regimen throughout 2022.

**Conclusion:**
T2DM patients have higher risk of micro and macro vascular complications compared to non-diabetic population. In com- parison to similar data generated in 2013, we observed consistent distribution across T2DM treatment lines and limited use of recent treatments/technologies. Treatment inertia is a major challenge in diabetes management, increasing the risk of future complications. Expanding access to new treatments, including CGM, could reduce treatment inertia and improve clinical outcomes for the T2DM popu- lation in France.

**Long-term survival associated with continuous positive airway**

**Background and aims:**
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) frequently coexists with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with reported prevalence rates between 50% and 80%. Despite its substantial impact on cardiovascular risk and mortality, OSA often goes undiagnosed in T2D. In T2D free populations with OSA, evidence for continuous positive airway pres- sure (CPAP) reducing mortality remains inconclusive, though some epidemiological data suggest benefits. Previous studies in patients with comorbid T2D and OSA have often been limited by short follow-up periods and a primary focus on metabolic endpoints, rather than on longer-term clinical outcomes such as mortality. As such OSA is not currently considered a modifiable risk factor in T2D management and is not systematically sought after, further contributing to the under- diagnosis. This study aimed to determine whether T2D patients with confirmed OSA who were prescribed CPAP demonstrate improved long-term survival compared to T2D patients never prescribed CPAP (whose OSA status is unknown). The rationale for this grouping is that, despite potential dilution from including OSA free individuals in the control group, the high estimated prevalence of OSA among T2D - together with the higher baseline risk associated with T2D- OSA comorbidity - should allow any clinically relevant associations of CPAP to be detected. Consequently, this approach would theoretically provide a conservative estimate of such an association.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from five Swedish national registers were linked. Adults with T2D were included without exclusions. T2D patients with OSA ever-prescribed CPAP (n=12,388) were compared with T2D patients (of unknown OSA status) never prescribed CPAP (n=737,911). The CPAP group was younger (mean 58±11 vs. 65±13 years) yet had a higher mean BMI (34.7±7.3 vs. 30.6±6.8 kg/m²). A time-varying Cox regression model adjusted for fixed baseline differ- ences (age, sex, prior cardiovascular disease) and time-varying factors (BMI, smoking, cholesterol, kidney function, blood pressure, and phar- macological treatment). All-cause mortality was the primary outcome.

**Results:**
During the 14-year follow-up, 212,336 deaths occurred in the non-CPAP group and 764 in the CPAP group. Time-varying Cox regression showed a significantly lower mortality risk with CPAP, cor- responding to a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.68- 0.82, P>0.001).

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that patients with comorbid T2D and OSA who were prescribed CPAP had an approximately 26% lower risk of death over a 14-year period, compared with T2D patients who never received CPAP. However, rigorous causal inference methods are needed to determine the causal effect of CPAP treatment.

**Background and aims:**
Childhood obesity is increasing globally including in low- and middle-income countries. This study described the distribution of childhood obesity and their related comorbidities in <12-year-old children assessed from 2002 to 2022 at a tertiary hospital in South Africa.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective electronic chart review included <12-year-old children presenting with obesity at IALCH. Data extracted comprised socio-demographic and lifestyle histories, physical examination and biochemical analyses. The WHO child growth reference was used to define obesity as z-score ≥2 standard deviations (SD) for 5-19-year-olds, and z-score ≥3 SD for <5-year- olds. Systolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥95 percentile for age, gender and height defined hypertension. SBP or DBP ≥90 but <95 percentile defined prehypertension. Type 2 diabetes and predia- betes diagnoses were based on oral glucose tolerance tests or random blood glucose levels. Dyslipidaemia was deemed present with any abnormality of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides.

**Results:**
Among 430 participants, 52.1% (n=224) were male, 27.9% (n=120) were ≤5-years-old and 64.7% were black African, while 27.9% were Indian/Asian. Unhealthy lifestyle behaviours were preva- lent: 42.3% spent <30 minutes/day on physical activity, 43.5% spent >2 hours/day on screen time and 47.9% consumed soft drinks daily. Family history of obesity (41.9%), diabetes (40.5%) and hypertension (40.0%) was common. Among participants, hypertension (46.1%) and prehypertension (12.8%) burden were high. Type 2 diabetes prevalence was low at 1.6% but prediabetes was 3.3%. Any dyslipidaemia was prevalent at 30.2%.

**Conclusion:**
The high burden of cardiometabolic comorbidities in obese children, including those ≤5-years-old, is concerning. It war- rants concerted interventions at a young age to prevent a worsening of comorbidities and the reversal of prehypertension and prediabetes, which is likely to increase with older age and into adulthood. Unhealthy dietary habits, low activity levels and sedentary behaviours in children need to be urgently targeted to reduce obesity and its comorbidities.

**Background and aims:**
Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) affects 40-50% of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). The introduction of modula- tor therapy has significantly improved life expectancy and nutritional status. In Denmark, all patients with CFRD are followed at two national centers. The Danish CF population is quite homogenous, with approx- imately 80% carrying the delta F508 mutation, which is associated with a severe phenotype. The current glycaemic treatment target for CFRD is HbA1c < 53 mmol/l and for those using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), a Time In Range (TIR) > 70%. This study aimed to evaluate glycaemic regulation, insulin treatment regimens, and use of diabetes technology in the Danish CFRD population.

**Materials and methods:**
This nationwide, cross-sectional study included all individuals in Denmark diagnosed with CFRD, defined by insulin use or ≥2 abnormal OGTTs (2-hour glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L), or elevated HbA1c (>48 mmol/mol) on two occasions. The cohort was identified through the Danish CF Registry, which includes all CF cases in Denmark. Health records were reviewed to validate diagnoses and extract data on treatment regimens and glycaemic control.

**Results:**
We identified 151 individuals with CFRD, corresponding to a prevalence of 1% in adolescents with CF (age 10 - 17 years) and 40% in adults with CF (> 18 years). Among them, 7% used insulin pumps (CSII), 41% used basal-bolus treatment (MDI), 11% used only basal or mixed insulin (Basal only), 6% used only bolus insulin (Bolus only), and 33% did not use insulin. No individuals with CFRD received other glucose-lowering agents.The median HbA1c was 48 mmol/mol overall and 53 mmol/mol among those on insulin, with 10% having HbA1c ≥ 70 mmol/mol. Approximately 60% of individuals on CSII or MDI used CGM, with a median TIR of 70% and median time below range of 1%. No cases of severe hypoglycaemia were recorded in the year before data collection

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, glycaemic control in the Danish CFRD cohort was generally good, with 50% of insulin-treated individuals achieving a HbA1c < 53 mmol/l, compared to 31% of individuals with type 1 diabetes (2023 national Danish survey). However, a small subgroup remained severely dysregulated, highlighting the need for further intervention, potentially including automated insulin delivery (AID) systems.

**Related factors of the dawn phenomenon in patients with type 2 diabetes**

Y. Xia

**Background and aims:**
The mechanism of the dawn phenomenon in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is not well understood, and no targeted drugs are available. This study uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to identify patients with the dawn phenomenon, observe their clinical characteristics, and explore the relevant influencing factors.

**Materials and methods:**
T2D patients from the Department of Endo- crinology at Nanjing First Hospital were included in the study. All patients underwent CGM monitoring before any changes to their glucose-lowering regimen, and 24-hour dynamic blood glucose data were randomly selected. The dawn phenomenon was defined as a noc- turnal glucose nadir >3.9 mmol/L and a blood glucose increase >1.11 mmol/L from 3 AM to 7 AM. Basic data, including medication, com- plications, HbA1c, and thyroid function, were recorded.

**Results:**
A total of 524 patients were screened, with 265 exhibit- ing the dawn phenomenon. A control group of 216 patients was matched based on HbA1c levels. The dawn phenomenon group showed significantly higher blood glucose fluctuations compared to the control group, with SD (2.261 vs. 1.779, P=0.001) and CV (22.862 vs. 16.971, P<0.001). Correlation analysis revealed a nega- tive correlation between thyroid function (TFQIFT3) and blood glu- cose difference (r=-0.211, P=0.002), while LDL showed a positive correlation with fasting blood glucose (r=0.242, P=0.001) and blood glucose difference (r=0.123, P=0.083). Regression analysis indicated that TFQIFT3 (β=-2.399, P<0.001) and LDL (β=0.550, P=0.004) were independent predictors of blood glucose difference, explain- ing 13.9% of the variance (R²=0.139, P<0.001). Logistic regression showed TFQIFT3 reduced the risk (OR=0.286, P=0.046), while LDL increased the risk (OR=1.728, P=0.032).

**Conclusion:**
Thyroid function (TFQIFT3) and LDL levels play signifi- cant roles in the dawn phenomenon, with TFQIFT3 acting as a protec- tive factor and LDL as a risk factor. Increased blood glucose variability is associated with the phenomenon, and obesity may provide indirect protection by reducing glucose variability.

**Background and aims:**
CLEC11A has been recently characterized as a potent stimulator that promote Beta-cell function and proliferation, but the physiological role of CLEC11A remains poorly understood. This study measured the serum CLEC11A levels in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and explored the correlations between its serum levels and various metabolic parameters in T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed a cross-sectional study. We analyzed the concentrations of CLEC11A by ELISA in blood samples of 306 well-characterized individuals in whom anthropometric param- eters, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), glycosylated hemoglobin, blood lipids. The participants were divided into T2DM patients (n = 151) and age-, sex- and BMI-matched healthy control subjects (n = 155).

**Results:**
Serum CLEC11A levels were significantly lower in T2DM patients than in healthy control subjects (59.54±21.77 vs. 78.56±29.56, P < 0.01). In people with higher Serum CLEC11A levels, fasting blood sugar(5.88±1.24vs. 6.5±1.82, P < 0.01), postprandial blood sugar(8.53±4.61 vs. 10.62±4.24, P < 0.01), and triglycerides (1.68±1.07 vs. 2.47±4.01, P < 0.01) were lower. Spearman correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between CLEC11A and post- prandial blood sugar in the overall population (β: -0.04[-0.06~-0.03], p <0.001). After adjust the confounding factors including age, sex, lipid, BMI, Waist-to-Hip Ratio, the association remains significant. Besides, multivariable logistic regression model showed that individuals with high CLEC11A had a significantly lower risk of T2DM compared to those with low CLEC11A after adjusting for other potential confound- ers (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96 - 0.98, p < 0.001)

**Conclusion:**
In this cross-sectional study, the expression level of CLEC11A showed a significant negative correlation with fasting blood glucose, and people with high expression of CLEC11A had better blood glucose and lipid metabolism indicators. These findings suggest that upregulation of CLEC11A may not only reduce blood glucose by regulating glucose metabolism, but also reduce lipid deposition in liver by improving lipid metabolism abnormalities. It may be a new target for diabetes prevention, which needs to be further verified by longitu- dinal studies and molecular mechanism exploration.

**Background and aims:**
Uptake for community-based screening for T2D is inadequate with delays in diagnosis. Patients attending hospital can be screened for diabetes for early treatment. The aim of this study was to identify people with undiagnosed diabetes attending an Accident and Emergency (A&E) department

**Materials and methods:**
Screening was undertaken using HbA1c. Prediabetes was defined as HbA1c 42-47 and T2D ≥48 mmol/mol. The Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) score was calculated for all patients.

**Results:**
4953 patients (mean age 52.1 years, 41.8% males) were included. Normal glucose tolerance was seen in 3859 (77.2%), pre-DM in 707 (14.1%) and T2D in 387 (7.7%). By glycaemic status, the mean (SE) age was 50.5 (0.22), 56.1 (0.53) and 54.8 (0.72) years; HbA1c: 35.2 (0.08), 43.6 (0.19), 56.6 (0.25) mmol/mol; BMI: 28.4(0.11), 29.5 (0.25) and 31.3 (0.34); FINDRISC score: 8.6 (0.1), 10.2 (0.1), 11.2 (0.2), respectively (all p<0.0001). Age-related increase in undiagnosed diabetes was observed, with the greatest prevalence in those over 65 (13.2%) (p<0.0001). Diabetes prevalence in Whites vs Non-Whites was 9.3% vs 17.9% (p<0.0001). Relative risk ratios (RRR) from mul- tinomial logistic regressions indicated that each unit increase in the FINDRISC score was associated with a 9% increased risk for pre-DM (RRR (95% CI) 1.09 (1.07, 1.11) and a 17% increased risk for T2D (1.17 (1.14, 1.20) compared to normoglycaemia. After adjusting for age (13% (7-18%), sex (45% lower in women), ethnicity and smok- ing, there was minor effect modification for diabetes risk at 16% (1.16 (1.13-2.72). Ethnic minorities had higher incidence of pre-DM and T2D compared to Whites (42.65% vs 37.8%) and were twice as likely to have pre-DM (2.17 (1.72-2.76) or T2D (3.21 (2.21-4.64). Comparing different age groups, individuals over 45 years had higher prevalence of pre-DM and T2D (22.9% and 12.3%) than those below 45 years (11.6% and 6.7%) (p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Individuals attending A&E have a high incidence of unknown glucose intolerance. HbA1c is a valid and straightforward method to diagnose diabetes and can be a simple test to identify those with diabetes so that treatment can be instituted early. The FINDRISC score can be used to identify those at risk. Patients admitted to the hospital should be screened for diabetes using the HbA1c test.

**Background and aims:**
Approximately 100,000 Danish adults live with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D), as Denmark lacks a diabetes screening program. This study examines whether the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening program can be repurposed to identify individuals at risk of T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Using Danish registry data (2014-2018), we included individuals aged 50-74 years invited to CRC screening and diabetes-free at the time of invitation. Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) results were classified as ’positive’ (≥100 ng/mL) or ’negative’ (<100 ng/mL) and further as ’no detectable fecal blood’ (<36 ng/mL) or ’detectable fecal blood’ (≥36 ng/mL). The amount of fecal blood was also analyzed as a continuous measure. Cox proportional hazards models estimated T2D risk, with additional discontinuity regression and subgroup analyses to account for diagnostic activity and repeated FIT measures.

**Results:**
Among 1,737,269 eligible individuals, 63% participated, and 67,408 tested ’positive.’ FIT-positive participants had a 53% higher risk of T2D (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.48-1.58) than FIT-negative participants, independent of fecal blood quantity or sex (table 1). Those with two consecutive measures of detectable fecal blood had double the T2D risk compared to those with no detectable blood.

**Conclusion:**
The link between occult fecal blood and T2D risk sug- gests that FIT-based CRC screening could aid early identification of individuals at high metabolic risk while maintaining its primary focus on CRC detection.

**1,5-anhydroglucitol: a valuable bioactive marker for exploring microbiome and nutrition interplay in diabetes**

J.M. Lopez-Pedrosa

**Background and aims:**
1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) is a validated biomarker for short-term glycemic control in blood. A reduction in serum 1,5-AG is strongly correlated with postprandial hyperglycemia, glycemic variability, and diminished insulin secretion capacity in indi- viduals with prediabetes and well-controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM). As a non-metabolizable glucose analogue, 1,5-AG is present in blood due to dietary intake. This study aims to elucidate the potential contri- bution of gut microbiota to 1,5-AG circulation and to determine how dietary carbohydrates influence 1,5-AG blood levels through modu- lation of gut microbial composition in prediabetic and diabetic rats. In addition, the potential insulin secretagogue effects of 1,5 AG was examined in NS-1 832/13 rat insulinoma cell line.

**Materials and methods:**
Healthy, prediabetic (fed a high-fat diet), and diabetic (treated with streptozotocin) Wistar rats were used. The animals were divided into two groups within each population: RDC, fed a diet based on rapidly digestible carbohydrates; and SDC, fed a diet based on slowly digestible carbohydrates. The feeding period lasted 22 days. Serum and cecal content samples were collected from the animals for the analysis of 1,5-AG levels, which were measured using UPLC-MS/MS. Fecal samples were isolated to analyze the intestinal microbiota populations. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. In the study, INS-1 cells were incubated in the presence of 1,5-AG (0.01 to 25 mM) or Glucose (25 mM).

**Results:**
Serum 1,5-AG levels were lower in diabetic (0.04 μg/mL) than in prediabetic (3.14 μg/mL) and healthy (5.22 μg/mL) rats and were clearly associated with the 1,5-AG cecal content found in diabetic (0.21 μg), prediabetic (1.22 μg) and healthy (1.88 μg) rats. The micro- bial production of 1,5-AG in cecum might emerged as an independent predictor for serum 1,5-AG levels as demonstrated by linear regression analysis (Spearman r= 0.6182; p< 0.05). Dietary carbohydrates had varying effects on serum 1,5-AG levels. The SDC groups exhibited a significant linear increase in serum 1,5-AG levels in healthy (β = 0.31 μg/day), prediabetic (β = 0.19 μg/day), and diabetic rats (β = 0.17 μg/day) compared to the RDC groups. Notably, serum 1,5-AG levels remained constant throughout the 22-day intervention period in the RDC groups. Regarding gut microbiota, the abundance of Parabacte- roides spp., bacteria associated with carbohydrate metabolism, signifi- cantly increased following SDC consumption. Insulinoma cell assays revealed that 1,5-AG stimulated insulin release in a dose-dependent manner. The 1,5-AG insulin release mediated effects, were three times greater than that induced by glucose.

**Conclusion:**
Serum 1,5-AG levels in prediabetic and diabetic condi- tions are closely linked to production of 1,5-AG by the gut microbiome. The production of 1,5-AG by gut microbes was signifi- cantly influenced by the quality of dietary carbohydrates. Specific dietary carbohydrates (SDC) may offer a protective effect against the development of diabetes through a novel mechanism involving the enhancement of insulin secretion, mediated by increased 1,5-AG lev- els in the blood.

**Background and aims:**
Air pollutants, including particulate matter ­(PM , ­PM ) and nitrogen dioxide ­(NO ), contribute to the progres- sion of diabetes and its complications but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. This study aimed to examine the associ- ation of exposure ­toPM , ­PM , ­NO with HbA1c, whole-body insulin sensitivity (M-value) and β-cell function in people with recent-onset type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

**Materials and methods:**
Participants in the prospective German Dia- betes Study (GDS) were enrolled within 1 year after diabetes diagnosis. Associations between air pollutants were examined with HbA1c (377 T1D, 672 T2D), M-value (347 T1D, 619 T2D) and β-cell function (361 T1D, 664 T2D). The M-value was assessed from hyperinsuli- naemic-euglycaemic clamps, and β-cell function was estimated from C-peptide increase (ΔC-peptide) after glucagon stimulation (C-pep- tide - C-peptide ). Air pollution exposures were derived from data provided by the German Federal Environment Agency. Long- term exposure to ­PM , ­PM , and ­NO was calculated as average of exposures during the 5 years preceding study enrolment. Associations between exposures and outcomes were estimated using linear regres- sion adjusting for age, sex, smoking, socioeconomic status, season and physical activity.

**Results:**
Higher exposure to air pollution per 1 interquartile range of ­PM was associated with higher HbA1c, lower M-value (-0.93 mg/kg*min [95% CI -1.22; -0.64]; p<0.0001) and lower β-cell func- tion (decrease in ΔC-peptide by 5.2% [95% CI: 0.9%; 9.0%]; p<0.05) in participants with T2D. Similar associations were observed for ­PM and ­NO . Among individuals with T1D, higher exposure to air pollution was also associated with higher HbA1c levels whereas no inverse associations were observed with M-value and β-cell function.

**Conclusion:**
Long-term exposure to air pollution showed similar adverse associations with glycaemic control in T1D and T2D. In people with T2D, these associations appear to be attributable to detrimental effects on both whole-body insulin sensitivity and β-cell function.

4. ian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia, Basil

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes mellitus disproportionately affects First Nations peoples. This includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (Indigenous Australians), who comprise 3.8% of the Australian population, and experience ongoing harmful effects of colonisation and its impacts on the social determinants of health. Dia- betes mellitus predisposes to perioperative dysglycaemia and glycae- mic variability, which increase perioperative morbidity and mortality. Preliminary literature suggests Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experience disproportionate perioperative morbidity and mor- tality, similarly to First Nations peoples globally. However, the impact of perioperative glycaemic control on these outcomes has not been evaluated in this cohort.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective multicentre cohort study was conducted involving 16,396 patients undergoing surgery in eight South Australian hospitals from 2018-2023. Inclusion criteria included age ⩾18 years and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Exclusion crite- ria included pregnancy and hospital admission lasting <24 hours. We compared deidentified data on patient demographics, admission char- acteristics, and preoperative comorbidities, as well as perioperative medications, blood glucose levels (BGLs) and complications between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous Australian patients. Comparative analyses were performed using Chi-squared tests for categorical data and non-parametric tests for numerical data, with a p-value (p) of <0.05 considered statistically significant. Periopera- tive outcomes were adjusted using Generalised Estimating Equation models.

**Results:**
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (n=1,065) were over-represented (6.5% of the cohort), younger (mean age: 54.3 vs 68.2 years, p<0.0001) and more likely to be female (52.1% vs 41.6%, p<0.0001). Despite a higher pre-admission HbA1c (8.4% vs 7.8%, p<0.0001), post-operative day 0-7 mean BGLs were lower (8.7 vs 8.8mmol/L, p<0.0324). Nevertheless, they experienced more preop- erative comorbidity (CHD: 26.8% vs 14.8%, p<0.0001, chronic kid- ney disease: 21.9% vs 15.2%, p<0.0001, smoking: 49.0% vs 20.3%, p<0.0001) and perioperative complications (myocardial infarction: OR 3.29, 95%CI 2.61-4.17, p<0.0001, infection: OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.23- 1.69, p<0.0001, in-hospital mortality: OR 2.16, 95%CI 1.30-3.58, p=0.0029). These associations were attenuated, but not eliminated, after adjusting for patient demographics, surgical characteristics, comorbidities and perioperative glycaemic control.

**Conclusion:**
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients with diabe- tes mellitus undergoing surgery are younger than their non-Indigenous Australian counterparts yet experience more preoperative morbidity and perioperative complications. Possible contributors include higher cumulative glycaemic exposure, highlighting the importance of long- term glycaemic optimisation and preoperative planning for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to reduce perioperative inequity.

3. Helsinki, Finland, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.

**Background and aims:**
While a healthy diet and increased physical activity are considered the standard of care for individuals with pre- diabetes, only about 10% successfully sustain these lifestyle changes. As a result, most individuals with prediabetes remain untreated, highlighting the need for safe and effective interventions to curb this growing epidemic. SiPore21 offers a promising solution. Composed of precisely engineered mesoporous silica particles, SiPore21 acts as a molecular sieve, separating digestive enzymes from food. This slows digestion, reduces caloric absorption, and improves blood glucose control. Delivered as an oral gel, SiPore21 works locally in the gut when taken with meals and represents an innovative medical device for managing blood glucose. Two previous clinical trials conducted with SiPore21 prototypes demonstrated it is safe, well tolerated, and has the potential to lower long-term blood glucose levels. This SHINE trial assessed the efficacy and safety of SiPore21 in managing blood glucose levels and improving metabolic parameters in individuals with overweight or obesity who had prediabetes or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 318 individuals with overweight or obesity and elevated blood glucose levels were enrolled in this rand- omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants consumed SiPore21 or a placebo with their main meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—3 times daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c levels, with secondary outcomes including changes in body weight, lipid profiles, and other metabolic parameters.

**Results:**
SiPore21 led to a significant reduction in HbA1c levels from baseline. Other metabolic parameters such as body weight, LDL-C, sagittal abdominal diameter, and waist circumference also showed significant improvements. HOMA-B levels remained stable in the SiPore21 treatment group, while a significant decline was observed in the placebo group. SiPore21 showed excellent safety profile with no serious adverse device effects reported.

**Conclusion:**
This trial demonstrates the efficacy and safety of a 12-week SiPore21 intervention, addressing an unmet medical need. The findings highlight SiPore21’s potential as a safe and effective option for blood glucose management in individuals with prediabetes and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Despite their benefits, cardioprotective glu- cose-lowering drugs (cardioprotective GLDs) remain underutilized in patients with both type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to identify risk factors for not initiating cardiopro- tective GLDs.

**Materials and methods:**
Using nationwide Danish health care regis- tries, patients with a dual diagnosis of T2DM and CVD were identi- fied from January 1, 2015, to July 31, 2021. T2DM was identified by diabetes medication use, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, podiatry services, and diagnostic codes. CVD diagnoses were based on data from the National Patient Register and National Surgery Codes. Cardi- oprotective GLDs included sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA). We used robust Poisson regression to estimate relative risks (RR) of not initiating treatment with cardioprotective GLDs within one year of dual diagnosis of T2DM and CVD. The index date for dual diagnosis was the date of the latest T2DM or CVD diagnosis.

**Results:**
A total of 80,874 patients were included (38% females). The mean age and diabetes duration for female and male non-initiators were 75±12 and 71±11 years, and 4.3±6.7 and 3.3±5.9 years, respectively. Figure 1 shows the relative risk (RR) for non-initiation of cardioprotec- tive GLDs. For females, unemployment (RR 1.09, 95% CI:1.06-1.12), retirement (RR 1.08, 95% CI:1.05-1.12), newly diagnosed diabetes (RR 1.20, 95% CI:1.18-1.21) and diabetes duration of 0-3.25 years (RR 1.13, 95% CI:1.11-1.16) were associated with higher risk of not initiating treatment, whereas a low education level (0-10 years) (RR 1.02, 95% CI:1.00-1.04) and medium education level (10-15 years) (RR 1.01, 95% CI:0.99-1.03) were weaker risk factors for not initiating treatment. For males, unemployment (RR 1.06, 95% CI:1.05-1.08), retirement (RR 1.07, 95% CI:1.05-1.09), newly diagnosed diabetes (RR 1.34, 95%CI:1.33-1.36) and diabetes duration of 0-3.25 years (RR 1.19, 95% CI:1.17-1.21) were similarly linked to higher risk of non-initia- tion, whereas education levels of 0-10 and 10-15 years, were weaker risks factors. Higher HbA1c levels and increasing age were associated with elevated risk in both genders, with older age groups showing the highest relative risks.

**Conclusion:**
Socioeconomic factors, particularly new onset diabetes, unemployment and retirement along with clinical factors such as higher age and HbA1c levels were associated with non-initiation of cardiopro- tective GLDs in both male and female patients with a dual diagnosis of T2DM and CVD.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin remains a key component in the treat- ment of diabetes mellitus. However, shifts in therapeutic strategies and socioeconomic determinants may influence prescribing practices. The objective of this study was to analyse insulin prescription trends over a seven-year period in a publicly insured population, with a focus on dif- ferences by sex and income level. Data were obtained from the (BDCAP), a nationwide registry of clinical and prescription data from primary care in Spain.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective observational study analysed aggregated data from 2017 to 2023. The primary outcomes were: (1) number of individuals with insulin prescriptions per 1,000 assigned persons and (2) defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 per- sons per day. Data were stratified by sex and income level (based on pharmacy copayment categories). Temporal trends were evaluated descriptively, with particular attention to differences across sociode- mographic strata.

**Results:**
From 2017 to 2023, insulin prescription rates declined over- all, from 2.87 to 2.58 persons per 1,000, and DDD from 2.23 to 1.73. Women consistently had lower prescription rates and DDD than men throughout the study period. Notably, individuals in lower income brackets (exempt or minimum copayment groups) had higher rates of insulin use compared to those in higher income groups, suggesting potential disparities in diabetes burden or access to newer therapies. The most marked decline in DDD occurred after 2019 across all sub- groups, coinciding with broader uptake of non-insulin glucose-lower- ing medications.

**Conclusion:**
Insulin prescribing has decreased in recent years, with dif- ferences observed by sex and income level. These findings underscore the impact of socioeconomic factors on diabetes management and the need for equity-focused approaches in therapeutic decision-making. The BDCAP database offers a valuable tool for monitoring real-world treatment trends and informing public health strategies.

**Background and aims:**
Metformin remains a cornerstone in type 2 diabetes mellitus management. However, imeglimin, a novel oral anti- diabetic agent, offers a promising alternative with fewer gastrointestinal side effects and a potentially lower risk of lactic acidosis, especially for metformin-intolerant patients. It improves glycemic control without significantly affecting renal or lipid profiles. This study evaluated the real-world glycemic efficacy and metabolic effects of imeglimin.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective study included patients with T2DM who switched from metformin (500-1500 mg/day) to imeg- limin (500-2000 mg/day) due to intolerance or contraindications. The follow-up period spanned from May 2023 to January 2025. Based on clinical discretion, Imeglimin was initiated at 500 to 2000 mg daily doses. Glycemic parameters were recorded at baseline and follow- up, including glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial glucose (PPG), lipid profile, renal parameters, and blood pressure.

**Results:**
The study included 53 patients with a mean age of 54.17±11.11 years (range: 30-77) and a mean BMI of 27.73±9.53 kg/m² (range: 17.89-87.60; males: 39.6%, females: 60.4%). At base- line, the mean weight was 68.36±14.23 kg, and BMI was 27.78±10.14 kg/m². Following imeglimin therapy, the mean weight decreased to 66.54±14.19 kg at follow-up, but the 2.66% reduction was not statisti- cally significant (P=0.539). BMI slightly decreased from 27.78±10.14 kg/m² to 27.65±10.18 kg/m², showing a 0.46% reduction, which was also not significant (P=0.212). HbA1c significantly decreased from 8.33±1.21% to 8.12±1.08% (P=0.011), indicating an absolute reduc- tion of 0.21 %. Although not statistically significant, FBG showed a numerical reduction from 164.16±62.21 mg/dL to 145.55±40.95 mg/ dL (P=0.058, 12.84% reduction). PPG decreased from 238.52±93.47 mg/dL to 205.05±64.54 mg/dL (P=0.099, 14.03% reduction). No sig- nificant changes were observed in renal function and lipid profile.

**Conclusion:**
Imeglimin, initiated at 500-2000 mg doses, demonstrated clinically meaningful HbA1c reduction in patients with T2DM who were intolerant or contraindicated to metformin. The therapy had no significant impact on renal function, lipid profile, or blood pressure. Switching from metformin to imeglimin resulted in a significant reduc- tion in glycemic parameters, highlighting its potential as an effective alternative therapy in T2DM management.

**Significant increase in use of weight-loss medications in Norway: analysis of trends 2004-2024 and implications**

H.L. Gulseth

**Background and aims:**
Overweight and obesity are leading causes of type 2 diabetes deveolpment, and increasing worldwide. New treat- ment modalities are emerging and implemented rapidly. The timeline of marketing of these drugs and their reimbursement policies influence weight-loss drug utilization. Norway has reimbursed bupropion-nal- trexone for weight loss since 2017, where as liraglutide was reimbursed for weight loss in Norway from 2020 until January 2023. Semaglutide and tirzepatide are currently not reimbursed for weight loss. We aimed to analyze patterns of use of weight-loss medications in Norway from 2004 to 2024.

**Materials and methods:**
We obtained data on weigt-loss medication from the nationwide Norwegian Prescribed Drug database (NorPD) covering all dispensed drugs in Norway from 2004 to 2024 to describe prevalent use and trends of weight-loss medication in total and accord- ing to age and sex. GLP-1 analogues reimbursed for treatment of type 2 was not included in these analyses.

**Results:**
More than 172,000 individuals, 5.9% of women and 2.3% of men aged 18-79, utilized weight-reducing medications in 2024. Since 2022 GLP-1 analogues have been the most frequently dispensed weight-loss medication in Norway, and in 2024 we identified 148.000 (71% females) unique users. Gender-specific analysis showed higher utilization among women across all age groups, with a peak prevalence within the 50-59 age group (8,5% females, 3,4% males. Notably, the use of GLP-1 analogues has also extended to adolescents aged 12-17, in 2024 there were 700 users; a 70% increase since 2022. The use of bupropion-naltrexone has decreased from a maximum of 43.000 (0.8%) users in 2022 to 28.000 (0.5%) in 2024.

**Conclusion:**
The uptake of newer weight-loss medications in Nor- way highlights a significant shift in obesity management strategies, and are likely to impact diabetes incidence and prevalence futher on. Changes in availability and reimbursement have influenced the use of these drugs in recent years. Continued research is essential to optimize their application in routine care and to address the associated economic and health outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Ezetimibe has demonstrated favorable out- comes, including reductions incardiovascular complications and improvements in insulin resistance. However, its potential asso- ciationwith cancer risk remains largely unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of ezetimibecombination therapy with statins on cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes using real- world data.

**Materials and methods:**
This nationwide retrospective observational study analyzed health records from the Korean Health Insurance Ser- vice database, using propensity score matching to compare the effect of ezetimibe combination therapy with statin monotherapy on cancer risk in statin users with type 2 diabetes, with outcomes including cancer incidence, cancer-related mortality, and all-cause mortality.

**Results:**
Among 299,472 individuals with type 2 diabetes who main- tained statin therapy for more than three months, 53,381 initiated ezetimibe in combination with statins around the same time and con- tinued both for over three months. These individuals were matched with type 2 diabetes patients who maintained statin therapy alone, without ezetimibe use, for comparative analysis. In the final matched cohort of 89,866 statin users, the combination of ezetimibe and statin was associated with a significantly lower risk of incident cancer (HR 0.88; P<0.001), cancer-related mortality (HR 0.80;P<0.001), and all- cause mortality (HR 0.92; P=0.033) compared to statin monotherapy. Ezetimibe combination therapy also reduced the risk of specific cancer types, including liver (HR 0.75; P=0.007)and lymphoid/hematopoietic cancers (HR 0.66; P=0.017).

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that ezetimibe combination ther- apy may have a protective effect against cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Previous research found a prospective bi- directional association between depressive symptoms and diabetes. Moreover, the strength of the association cross-sectionally differed depending on the quality of diabetes care across countries. We aimed to examine the potential role of several sociodemographic factors on both the country and the individual level in moderating the longitudinal association between depressive symptom severity and diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
The data were obtained by merging datasets from three large prospective cohort studies - the English Longitudi- nal Study on Ageing, the Irish Longitudinal study on Ageing, and the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. We applied a survival analysis design to two samples of 44,059 and 35,993 Euro- pean participants, testing two directions of associations. The observed country-level factors included quality of diabetes healthcare, diabetes- related expenditure, age-specific risk of poverty, gender inequality, and wealth inequality. The individual-level factors included age, gender, body mass index, smoking, and physical activity.

**Results:**
Elevated depressive symptoms predicted the risk of diabetes, HR = 1.12; 95% CI [1.07, 1.16], and vice versa, HR = 1.28; 95% CI [1.20, 1.37]. All selected sociodemographic factors significantly (p < .01) predicted both the risk of diabetes and the incidence of elevated depression symptoms. However, these factors did not moderate the strength of the association between diabetes and depressive symp- toms in either direction (p > .01). Post-hoc analysis showed that the strength of the associations did not considerably vary across countries, which supports the notion of the strength of the predictive associations between depressive symptoms and diabetes being stable and independ- ent of a country of living.

**Conclusion:**
Across the European countries, more severe depressive symptoms increased the risk of diabetes, and vice versa. These relation- ships were not moderated by any of the selected sociodemographic factor variables, even though the factors individually did predict both the risk of diabetes and the elevated depressive symptoms. The results suggest that the association between depressive symptoms and diabetes risk is consistent across different sociodemographic groups including country- and individual-level factors. Our study shows that depressive symptoms can reliably predict relative differences in the risk of diabetes, and vice versa, in people over 50 years old across many European countries.

6. Tyne, UK, University of the Philippines Manila, Manila, Philippines.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is more prevalent among south Asians compared with Caucasians. We hypothesise that South- and Southeast-Asians are more likely to develop T2D due to a higher susceptibility to store fat ectopically within the liver and pancreas.

**Materials and methods:**
In this pilot study, we conducted two cross- sectional studies with Filipinos and Malays who are of the same ethnic group from the Malay Archipelago (n=69; 33 with T2D/ 36 controls; Table 1) and measured intra-organ fat content using MRI Dixon method. We quantified pancreas and liver fat content and compared with data from UK Biobank (UKBB) in south Asians. In addition, we compared our results with previously published data from the DiRECT study (white Caucasians).

**Results:**
Main characteristics of the recruited participants are presented in Table 1. There was no significant difference in liver or pancreatic fat between people with and without T2D in the Southeast Asian cohort from the Malay Archipelago (11.4±1.2 vs. 11.9±1.5%, p = 0.722 and 8.2±0.4 vs. 9.0±0.8%, p = 0.738, respectively). However, liver fat content was significantly lower in UKBB Asians compared with their Southeast Asian counterparts [T2D (5.9±1.2 vs. 11.4±1.2%, p = 0.0004), and non-diabetic groups (4.9±0.3 vs. 11.9±1.5%, p < 0.0001)]. Furthermore, pancreatic fat was lower in T2D (8.2±0.4 vs. 13.7±2.0% p = 0.012) and higher in controls (9.0 ±0.8 vs. 8.5±0.5%, p = 0.046) when comparing Southeast Asians with UKBB Asians.Both liver and pancreas fat were higher in nondiabetic Southeast Asians compared with non- diabetic individuals from the DiRECT study (11.9±1.5 vs. 4.4 ±1.1% p<0.0001, and 9.0±0.8 vs. 6.20 ±0.4%, p<0.001, respectively). However, in T2D Southeast Asian participants, liver fat was lower compared with T2D patients from the DiRECT study (11.4±1.2 vs 16.0±1.4%, p<0.05), whereas pancreatic fat was not different (8.2±0.4 vs 8.5±0.3%, p>0.05), respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Our results demonstrate that South Asians may have lower intraorgan fat thresholds than Caucasians that may explain the susceptibility to develop T2D at lower BMI. Southeast Asians liv- ing in Malaysia and the Philippines exhibited different intra-organ fat patterns compared with Asians resident in the UK, which may help to explain the differences in T2D aetiology. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms behind this difference in intraorgan fat deposition patterns and its role in the aetiology and pathophysiology of T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Current guidelines recommend lifestyle inter- vention (LI) in people with prediabetes. High 1-hour post-load plasma glucose (1h-PG ≥ 8.6 mmol/L) has been demonstrated to identify T2D risk earlier than current criteria. We hypothesized that response to LI would be particularly effective in high 1h-PG as it is indicative of pathophysiological changes between normal glucose regulation (NGR) and impaired glucose regulation (IGR).

**Materials and methods:**
NGR, IGR (fasting PG≥ 5.6 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L or 2-h PG ≥ 7.8 mmol/L and < 11.1 mmol/L) or high 1h-PG (NGR and 1h-PG ≥ 8.6 mmol/L) was present in 318 people from the Tübingen Lifestyle Intervention Program who received LI (monthly dietary counseling to achieve ≥ 5% weight loss; increased physical activity) for 9 months. Participants were metabolically pheno- typed with a 75g oral glucose tolerance test, whole-body MRI and ¹H magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline and after LI. Incident T2D was determined in a 12-year follow-up period. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to analyze longitudinal data. One-way ANOVA was conducted to evaluate individual differences for group-wise com- parisons during LI. Difference of means are reported. Chi-Squared tests, with Bonferroni post-hoc correction, were utilized for analyzing categorical variables.

**Results:**
At baseline, insulin sensitivity (mean [SD]: NGR: 22.1 [10.2], 1h-PG: 15.9 [7.93], IGR: 12.8 [7.05], p<0.001) and β-cell function (NGR: 40700 [19600], 1h-PG: 26500 [12900], IGR: 20900 [13300], p <0.001) declined progressively from NGR (n=106) to high 1h-PG (n=96) and to IGR (n=116) groups. Intrahepatic lipids (IHL, NGR: 3.58 [3.50], 1h-PG: 5.25 [5.35], IGR: 8.22 [8.13], p<0.001) and vis- ceral adipose tissue volume (VAT, NGR: 2.45 [1.76], 1h-PG: 3.51 [2.08], IGR: 3.68 [2.12], p<0.001) increased from NGT to high 1h-PG and to IGR.LI improved insulin sensitivity (percent change from base- line [SD]: 1h-PG: 22.10% [57.99%], IGR: 22.30% [120.50%], p=0.96) and β-cell function (1h-PG: 28.32% [94.03%]. IGR: 17.46% [79.52%], p=0.44) similarly in 1h-PG and IGR. Improvements in IHL (1h-PG: -35.18% [325.34%], IGR: -33.52% [133.13%], p=0.66) and VAT (1h- PG: -21.93% [26.74%], IGR: -5.29% [24.64%], p=0.75) were also comparable. Post LI, β-cell function (1h-PG: 34005.57 [18639.00], IGR: 24549.97 [16765.08], p=0.013), insulin sensitivity (1h-PG: 19.41 [8.92], IGR: 15.65 [9.78], p=0.035) and glucose regulation (fasting PG: p<0.001, 60 min PG: p=0.018, 120 min PG: p<0.001) were better in 1h-PG than in IGR. Remission to complete normoglycemia occurred more often in the high 1h-PG group compared to IGR (2.18 [1.13 - 4.28], p = 0.021). Risk of T2D during 12-years follow-up was reduced by 80% (37 - 96 %, p = 0.005) in the high 1h-PG group compared to the IGR group.

**Conclusion:**
LI was more effective in reducing risk of incident T2D in people with high 1h-PG and NGR than in IGR when β-cell function, insulin sensitivity and IHL were less impaired. High 1h-PG serves as an early indicator of metabolic risk, allowing for optimized LI timing to more effectively prevent T2D.

**The incidence of recent-onset diabetes in pancreatic cancer: a sys- tematic review and meta-analysis**

Y. Jin

**Background and aims:**
Information on the clinical profile of recent- onset diabetes mellitus (DM) before diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) is limited. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the incidence of recent-onset diabetes (<5 years) before diag- nosis of PC and insulin-treated diabetes, and compared the incidence of DM among PC patients according to the duration of DM.

**Materials and methods:**
We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for relevant studies published between August 1948 and October 2022. Crude incidence data were extracted and analyzed using Stata 17 for meta-analysis.

**Results:**
A total of 40 relevant studies with 28,192 participants were included. The incidence of recent-onset diabetes mellitus was 20.2% (95% CI, 18.0%-22.6%) before diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The prevalence of insulin use was 22.7% (95% CI, 20.7%-24.8%) among patients with recent-onset diabetes. We estimated that the incidence of DM within 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years prior to PC was, respectively 9.7% (95% CI 8.4-11.1%), 18.1% (95% CI 15.4% - 20.9%), 18.6% (95% CI 15.4% - 21.7%), 19.5% (95% CI 14.4% - 24.6%) and 20.4% (95% CI 16.4% - 24.5%). Meta-regression analysis was per- formed to assess the effects of age, sex, BMI, the proportion of patients with smoking etiology and site of tumors. Age had positive effect on the studied outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
Patients developed recent-onset diabetes (<5 years) prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis with a frequency of about 20.2%. This meta-analysis highlights the clinical significance of recent-onset DM, particularly new-onset diabetes, as a potential marker for early PC detection. These findings suggest that new-onset diabetes may serve as a valuable clinical indicator for early detection of pancreatic cancer in high-risk populations.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a major risk factor for the develop- ment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, recent evidence from large population-based studies in high-income countries suggest that diag- nosed T2D-incidence is decreasing, while BMI levels are increasing. We aimed to describe the trajectories of blood glucose and anthropo- metric measurements in annual cross-sectional datasets over 18 years.

**Materials and methods:**
We used data from the Västerbotten Inter- vention Programme (VIP) - a population-based cohort that invites all adults from Västerbotten County at 40, 50 and 60 years of age. We included data from first-time participants between 2003 and 2020 without T2D and with complete data on socio-demographic informa- tion, blood glucose, and anthropometric measurements. We calculated smoothed moving average curves for fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2h-glucose, BMI, and waist circumference for the whole population, by age-group, sex, and educational level.

**Results:**
In this study population (n=44,827; mean age: 45.1 ± stand- ard deviation: 7.4 years; 51% men), mean FPG was 5.8 ± 0.6 mmol/L in 2003 and 5.1 ± 0.7 mmol/L in 2020. The values for 2h-glucose were 6.8 ± 1.4mmol/L in 2003 and 6.2 ± 1.6 mmol/L in 2020. Mean BMI was 26.1 ± 4.2 kg/m in 2003 and 26.9 ± 5.4 kg/m in 2020, while mean waist circumference was 90.5 ± 11.9 cm in 2003 and 92.5 ± 14.6 cm in 2020. Smoothed moving averages of FPG decreased between 2003 and 2020 while smoothed moving averages of BMI increased in the same time period (Figure). The same trend was observed for 2h-glucose and waist too. This phenomena, which was independent of education level, was observed in all age-groups, and both sexes.

**Conclusion:**
There appears to be an uncoupling of obesity and glucose whereby improvements in population level glucose correspond with declining or stable T2D -incidence. Further studies exploring what factors (eg: increased physical activity and favourable dietary intake and medication use) could be modifying the relationship obesity and glucose leading to this uncoupling should be explored.

3. Catholic University of Korea, Suwon-si, Republic of Korea, The

**Background and aims:**
Studies using systematic approaches which can assess multiple risk factors of type 2 diabetes (T2D) simultaneously are scarce. Here, we aimed to comprehensively identify risk factors associated with incident T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 377,909 unrelated participants of white British descent from the UK Biobank for 190 risk factors were included in the discovery set. We conducted an exposome-wide asso- ciation study (EWAS) of incident T2D. Then, we selected risk factors in each domain using elastic net regularization, and generated Cox regression models by combining selected risk factors in each domain. We estimated the potential impact of risk domains on incident T2D in the validation set.

**Results:**
In total, 142 out of 190 risk factors were significantly associ- ated with incident T2D. The top 5 detrimental risk factors included body fat percentage, major dietary changes in the last 5 years, whole body fat-free mass, whole body water mass, and waist circumference. The top 5 protective risk factors included usual walking pace, health satisfaction, coffee type (ground coffee), tea consumed, and average total household income before tax. In subgroup analysis, while age, sex, and body mass index showed significant interaction between fac- tors in several domains and incident T2D, polygenic risk score showed significant interaction only between factors in physical activity, physi- cal measure, socio-economic status categories, and incident T2D. The physical measure domain contributed most to the incidence of T2D among the different domains.

**Conclusion:**
Multidomain risk factors are associated with incident T2D. Our findings suggests the possibility that improvement in multi- domain risk factors can prevent the incident T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Physical inactivity is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. It is therefore essential to understand the association between physical activity and age at diagno- sis of type 2 diabetes to inform preventative efforts in individuals with early-onset type 2 diabetes (diagnosis <40 years) who are at a higher risk of complications.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study utilised pooled data from studies undertaken at the Leicester Diabetes Centre, Eng- land. Physical activity was measured via wrist-worn accelerometery for 7-14 days and type-2 diabetes status and demographic informa- tion were self-reported. Using generalised linear models, we predicted differences in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and likelihood of meeting physical activity guidelines (150mins MVPA/ week) between individuals with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes vs individuals without diabetes, across age categories (<40, 40-59 and ≥60 years), adjusted for sex, season of accelerometer wear and number of valid wear days.

**Results:**
In total, 1,817 individuals were included (49.3% women; 62.9% with type 2 diabetes; mean age [SD] 55.3 years [13.7]). In individuals without diabetes, an older age was associated with lower MVPA. In individuals with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, MVPA was more stable with age, but consistently lower than in individuals without diabetes ( ): -21.0 minutes/day (95% CI: -33.8, -8.3) at age <40 years, -15.0 minutes/day (-22.6, -7.4) at age 40-59 years, and -17.7 minutes/day (-29.6, -5.9) at age ≥60 years. Individuals with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes were similarly less likely to achieve recommended levels of MVPA than individuals without type 2 diabetes across all age categories ( ): relative risk with vs without diabetes= 0.62 (0.40, 0.95) at age <40 years; 0.75 (0.61, 0.93) at age 40-59 years; 0.63 (0.44, 0.90) at age ≥60 years.

**Conclusion:**
Newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes is associated with low physical activity regardless of age at diagnosis. This is of par- ticular concern for individuals with early-onset type 2 diabetes who are at higher risk of complications as compared to individuals with later-onset.

**Background and aims:**
Steroid use is well known to induce hyper- glycemia, increasing the risk of diabetes mellitus (DM). Concurrently, the use of local glucocorticoid injections (LGCIs), including epidural glucocorticoid injections, for managing joint and spinal pain has sig- nificantly increased in South Korea, coinciding with a rising prevalence of DM in the aging population. Given these trends, this study aimed to evaluate the association between LGCIs and new-onset diabetes mel- litus. Utilizing a propensity score-matched analysis, we compared the incidence of new-onset diabetes in patients who were non-diabetic at baseline and subsequently received LGCIs to matched patients who had never been exposed to steroid injections.

**Materials and methods:**
This nested case-control study used data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS). Steroid-naïve adults without diabetes from 2002-2015 were identified. Participants exposed to LGCIs (intra- articular, intramuscular, or nerve and joint injections) between 2016 and 2018 constituted the case group, whereas non-exposed individuals served as controls. Propensity score matching (1:2) based on age and sex yielded 13,080 cases and 26,160 controls. Diabetes was defined as fasting blood glucose levels >126 mg/dL or a diagnosis using ICD-10 codes E11, E12, or E14. Logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between steroid injections and diabetes. Statistical sig- nificance was set at P<0.05.

**Results:**
The incidence of new-onset diabetes was significantly higher in the LGCI group (3.8%) compared with the controls (2.8%). The crude OR for developing diabetes was 1.37 (95% CI 1.22-1.54, p<0.001), which remained significant after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and clinical confounders (adjusted OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.19-1.51, p<0.001). Moreover, the mean duration from LGCI exposure to diabetes onset was significantly shorter in the incident diabetes group (173.5 ± 110.7 days) than in the non-diabetic group (191.1 ± 108.6 days; t-test, p=0.009).

**Conclusion:**
Local corticosteroid injections significantly increase the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus. Given their widespread use, par- ticularly among aging populations, clinicians should carefully evalu- ate metabolic risks before administering corticosteroids and monitor glucose levels in at-risk patients.

2. Mergentheim, Germany, German Diabetes Center, Düsseldorf,

**Background and aims:**
Inflammation is discussed as a common bio- logical framework linking diabetes and depression. However, a compre- hensive understanding of the complex network between inflammation and depressive symptoms is missing. This analysis aimed at identify- ing central biomarkers of inflammation among a list of 76 biomarkers regarding their importance within an inflammation-depression network.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional analysis combined data from five studies in which biomarkers of inflammation and depressive symptoms were assessed. Serum levels of 76 biomarkers of inflam- mation were quantified with proximity extension assay technology. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemio- logical Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and symptom cluster scores for affective, somatic and anhedonia symptoms were calculated. In a first step, separate linear regression analyses were conducted to ana- lyse which biomarkers were significantly associated with at least one depressive symptom cluster (controlled for demographic, anthropomet- ric and medical variables). In a second step, only biomarkers with sig- nificant associations were included in a network analysis together with the three depressive symptom clusters (standardised scores). Measures of centrality were calculated that indicate the importance of a variable within the network. Separate networks for type 1 and type 2 diabetes were calculated.

**Results:**
Data from 1,160 participants (60.9% type 1 diabetes, age: 44.9±13.9 years, 52.7% female, CES-D total score: 21.9±11.1) were analysed. 23 biomarkers of inflammation showed significant associa- tions with depressive symptom clusters. In the type 1 diabetes sam- ple, the network achieved a high correlation stability coefficient of 0.751. Biomarkers with the highest strength (=importance) were CCL1 (chemokine), LIF-R (leukemia inhibitory factor), and CD5 (cell surface molecule). For the depressive symptom clusters, the affective subtype showed the highest strength. In the type 2 diabetes sample, the net- work achieved a slightly lower correlation stability coefficient of 0.672. LIF-R, CD5, and IL.18R1 (interleukin) were the most important bio- markers. The affective subtype showed the highest strength among the depressive symptom clusters. Network comparison test showed that global strength of the networks did not differ between type 1 and type 2 diabetes (p=0.51), but the network structure was significantly dif- ferent (p=0.009).

**Conclusion:**
Results suggest two distinct networks of the association between inflammation and depressive symptoms for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This may indicate different pathways for both diabetes types. LIF-R as well as CD5 were among the most important biomarkers within the inflammation-depression network, suggesting a key biologi- cal role.

**Novel pharmacokinetic assay for measuring SAB-142, a fully human anti-thymocyte globulin**

H. Wu

**Background and aims:**
In developing a pharmacokinetic (PK) assay for monitoring the fully human Anti-thymocyte globulin (hATG), SAB-142, in clinical trials, several challenges arise due to its fully human nature and the difficulty in distinguishing it from native poly- clonal human immunoglobulins. Here, we present a novel assay that was developed and validated for the quantitative measurement of the multi-targeted SAB-142 in human serum samples from SAB-142 Phase 1 clinical study with low-dose SAB-142 administration. This assay effectively overcomes these challenges through innovative approaches.

**Materials and methods:**
This is a flow cytometry-based PK assay that utilizes pooled human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), specifically gated for lymphocytes, as the targeted cell populations to measure the concentration of unbound free SAB-142 in the serum of study participants infused with SAB-142. The assay was validated for suitability and performance characteristics, including accuracy, precision, selectivity, and range, to ensure accurate quantification of SAB-142 in human serum. The validated assay has been employed to quantitatively measure the SAB-142 in human serum samples from participants in SAB-142 Phase 1 clinical study (SAB-142-101).

**Results:**
This assay was validated with a linear range between 80 μg/ mL and 0.25 μg/mL and ­R value of 0.9998. In the Phase 1 study (SAB-142-101) the ­C and AUC​ (Area Under the Curve from time zero to the last time point with measurable concentration) values of SAB-142 in human serum increased in a dose proportional manner across the 0.5 (Cohort 3), 1.5 (Cohort 4), and 2.5 mg/kg doses (Cohorts 5 and 5N) (Figure 1). Although systemic exposure to SAB-142 was limited for Cohort 3 at 0.5 mg/kg, the ­C values ranged from 0.679 to 1.01, 1.04 to 3.00 and 0.99 to 4.32 μg/mL for Cohort 4 at 1.5 mg/kg and Cohorts 5 and 5N at 2.5 mg/kg, respectively, and AUC​ values ranged from 9.15 to 36.0 and 31.7 to 105 h*μg/mL at 1.5 mg/kg (Cohort 4) and 2.5 mg/kg (Cohort 5), respectively. Half-life from Cohort 5 at 2.5 mg/ kg was between 26.4 and 61.6 hours. Although Cohort 5N received a different lot of SAB-142, its PK profile was similar to that of Cohort 5, demonstrating the lot-to-lot consistency of SAB-142 (Figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
The novel SAB-142 PK assay was developed and vali- dated with a Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) in human serum of 0.25 μg/mL. This assay has been utilized for monitoring PK in a first-in-man, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I study (SAB-142-101). Results from this study demonstrated that the overall drug exposure of free SAB-142, as assessed by ­C and AUC​ from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg.

**Specimen quality for multicenter clinical trials: comparing novel blood preservation methods to cryopreserved PBMC**

E.S. Sandhurst

**Background and aims:**
Standardizing sample collection, processing and, storage for a multi-site clinical trial is a challenging endeavor. Trial complexity increases when sample collection includes peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The established method of isolat- ing PBMC from whole blood (WB) using density gradient centrifuga- tion requires substantial training, specialized equipment, large blood volumes, and shipping logistics. WB preservation is an alternative to freezing isolated PBMC and has many advantages. Freezing WB retains the complete subsets of immune cells, requires less sample volume, and reduces training requirements. The preservation method is critically important as it can modify epitopes which could affect antibody recognition. This study compares novel WB preservation methods, fixatives, freezing temperatures, and processing times, to determine their impact on cellular epitopes. The goal was to identify the most-user friendly method which would optimally maintain the sample quality.

**Materials and methods:**
Peripheral whole blood was collected from three apparently healthy donors and processed at 3- or 30-hrs post- collection. Four different preservation methods were compared: PBMC isolation, Cytodelics (CT), Smart Tube Proteomic Stabilization Buffer (ST), and Cryostor CS10 (CS). PBMC and CS samples were stored in ­LN , CT tubes were stored at -20°C (CT-20) and -80°C (CT-80), and ST at -80°C. After thawing, the integrity of 25 cell surface antigens were evaluated in an immunophenotyping spectral cytometry panel that assessed the relative percentage of 20 T cell subsets. A visual inspection of the gated data was conducted to evaluate the resolution of each subset.

**Results:**
PBMC preparations were similar at 3- and 30-hrs post-col- lection. All methods were therefore compared to PBMCs processed at 30 hrs which is more logistically feasible. The CD3, CD4, CD8, and Treg cell populations were sufficiently resolved in each test matrix with comparable resolution in the corresponding gates. For CD4 and CD8 naïve and memory T cells, CS had similar resolution to PBMC isolation, but the resolutions of CT and ST were low. For ­CD4 stem cell memory (TSCM), CS, CT, and ST resolution was comparable to PBMC across all donors. Results were similar for ­CD8 TSCM except one donor consistently had lower resolution. For the ­CD4 exhaus- tion markers (PD-1, TIGIT, and KLRG1), CS provided comparable resolution to PBMC followed by the CT-20. For the ­CD8 exhaus- tion markers, CT-20 and CT-80 provided comparable resolution to the PBMC group.

**Conclusion:**
T cell subtype profiles were the most similar in CS com- pared to PBMC. Because the fixation of the CT and ST samples may alter epitopes, select monoclonal antibodies for the panel should be re- titered to increase resolution of the lower frequency populations. Inter- estingly, granulocytes, which are removed during PBMC processing, were preserved in CT and ST, but not CS, resulting in contamination of the lymphocyte gate. Thus, for CT and ST, this panel would benefit from the addition of a granulocyte marker as an exclusion marker to improve the specificity of the lymphocyte gate. For broader phenotyp- ing panels, the presence of granulocytes would be an advantage. The results for one donor were often different than the other two donors in terms of phenotype resolution, which highlights the importance of evaluating several donors for this type of feasibility study.

**Background and aims:**
Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are fermenta- tion products of dietary fibres, usually regarded as beneficial microbial metabolites due to their anti-inflammatory properties and metabolic benefits. However, the relationship between faecal SCFAs and glycae- mic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes is unknown.

**Materials and methods:**
In a cross-sectional cohort of 398 individuals with type 1 diabetes from the GUTDM1 cohort (64% female, mean age 42 ± 15 years, mean BMI 25±4 kg/m2, median diabetes duration 15 years [IQR 6-29]), we measured faecal short chain fatty acids (butyrate, acetate, propionate) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics. Using a logistic regression model, adjusted for BMI, we asso- ciated SCFA concentrations with time in range (TIR), expressed as in (≥70%) or below (<70%) the guideline target.

**Results:**
The median concentrations (μmol/g dryweight feces) of fae- cal SCFA [IQR] were 24.3 for butyrate [9.3-50.8], 72.2 for acetate [39.6-133.9] and 23.5 for propionate [13.1-43.5]. The median time in range in our cohort was 66[52-80]%. Lower butyrate levels were associated with a higher TIR (OR for TIR ≥70%: 0.77[0.61-0.95] and a lower TAR (OR 0.75 [0.59-0.93] per 177 μmol/g (1 SD) butyrate. The other SCFAs did not show an association with CGM-parameters. Adjusting for BMI as a potential confounder did not alter the effect of butyrate (OR 0,79 [0.62-0.98] for TIR). A higher faecal butyrate level was weakly correlated to a higher CRP (Spearman ρ = 0.10, p=0.09), but we found no associations between SCFAs and fibre intake, sys- tolic blood pressure, leucocytes, insulin units per kg bodyweight and triglycerides.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings indicate that higher faecal butyrate levels are associated with lower time in euglycaemic range. Further mecha- nistic studies are needed to disentangle this relationship and ascertain whether enhanced butyrate production in the gut alone contributes to worsening glycemic control or is the result of an overall perturbation of the gut microbial ecosystem.

**Background and aims:**
Avelumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that binds to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and blocks its interaction with the programmed death 1 (PD- 1) and B7.1 receptors. It has been approved for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) which is a rare skin cancer with poor prognosis, high rates of recurrence and has a mortality rate of 30%. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a rare complication of Avelumab, reported in less than 1% of patients in PD-1 inhibitor clinical trial. This case is notable for DKA which is a rare complication in PD-L1 therapy and furthermore for the time of onset , which occurred eight months following commencement of immunotherapy.

**Materials and methods:**
A 65 year old male patient was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of diabetic ketoac- idosis, during Avelumab treatment for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma(MCC). He had no personal or family history of diabe- tes mellitus (DM), while random venous glucose, measured dur- ing therapies was normal. In regards to his oncologic history, he was initially diagnosed with MCC of left forearm and local lymph node infiltration in July 2020, and underwent surgical resection of the tumor and local lymph nodes in August of that year. In 2023 was found a metastatic focus in the body of the pancreas (2 cm). The patient started immunotherapy with Avelumab in February 2024.Eight months later presented at the hospital critically ill. On admission, he had severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as evi- denced by venous glucose of 505mg/dl, pΗ of 7.2, bicarbonate of 9 mmol/L, ketonuria (ketones 40 mg/dl)with accompanying symp- toms of dry mouth, polyuria, polydipsia. The workup revealed no evidence of adrenal insufficiency or abnormal thyroid function. His HbA1c was 8.2% ,anti-GAD antibodies, islet cell antibodies Insulinoma-associated-2 autoantibodies (IA2) and Anti-zinc trans- porter protein 8 autoantibodies (ZnT8)were negative. Serum C-pep- tide were after glucagen test. No evidence of infection. The patient was started on fluid resuscitation and intravenous insulin and was admitted to the intermediate care unit for close monitoring and study of this new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient was discharged home with insulin glargine 40 units nightly and insulin lispro 10 units with meals.

**Results:**
.

**Conclusion:**
This case reports a very rare but significant complication of immune checkpoint inhibitor Avelumab . However healthcare profes- sionals should be aware of this adverse event. With the increasing use of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer management the incidence of this complication is likely to increase.Discussion around the risk of dia- betic ketoacidosis should be routine in patients receiving anti-PD- L1 therapy. Furthermore patients should receive education around symp- toms and signs of hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis to promote earlier presentation and diagnosis. Further investigation and research into the pathophysiology of this condition is required to facilitate identification of potential screening tests for patients at greater risk of developing anti PD -L1 induced DM as well as to guide management or preventative strategies for this complication.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin sensitivity (IS) is associated with a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes (T1D) when adjusted for insulin secretion. This study investigates whether the Matsuda Index, a well-established measure of IS, is associated with the presence and titers of islet autoantibodies (AAbs) in relatives of individuals with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed five islet AAbs—GAD, IA2, MIAA, ICA, and ZnT8—in AAb-positive relatives of T1D patients (n=7,137) enrolled in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study [age: 16.8 (±12.5) years, 51.3% female; T1D Stages: 36.4% Not Staged, 34.8% Stage 1, 21.4% Stage 2, 7.4% awaiting Stage 3 confirmation]. Associations between islet AAb type/titer and Matsuda Index were assessed using linear and logistic regression models, adjusting for Index60 (a marker of insulin secretion) and age.

**Results:**
After adjusting for Index60, the Matsuda Index was inversely associated with the presence of IA2 and ZnT8 (p<0.0001), as well as GAD and ICA (p<0.001). Similarly, it was inversely associated with AAb titers (p<0.0001 for GAD, IA2, and ICA; p=0.004 for ZnT8), except for MIAA, which showed a positive association for both pres- ence (p<0.0001) and titer (p<0.0001). After adjusting for Index60 and age, the positive association with MIAA was no longer significant, whereas the inverse associations for the other AAbs remained robust (presence: p<0.0001 for IA2, ZnT8, and ICA; p=0.001 for GAD; titer: p<0.0001 for IA2, ZnT8, and ICA; p=0.0003 for GAD).

**Conclusion:**
After accounting for insulin secretion and age, higher IS is inversely associated with the presence and titer of most islet AAbs. However, MIAA exhibits a distinct pattern, suggesting a potential age- related influence.

**A time resolved transcriptomic view of the natural progression of type 1 diabetes in alpha and delta cells**

1. Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel, IBM Research,

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from an autoim- mune attack on beta cells leading to near-complete beta-cell loss. In the early phases of disease, HLA class 1 genes are induced in insulin con- taining islets. HLA levels drop as islet cells are destroyed. While alpha and delta cells are not targeted by the immune system, T1D is asso- ciated with glucagon secretion dysfunction. Previous transcriptomic studies have shown alpha-cell de-differentiation and increased HLA class I gene expression in T1D patients and mouse models. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze transcriptomic changes in alpha and delta cells over the course of T1D progression.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed scRNA-seq data from the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP), including 12 T1D and 46 non-diabetic donors, covering 56,701 alpha cells and 6,890 delta cells. A BERT-based machine learning model was trained to classify alpha and delta cells from T1D and non-diabetic donors while minimiz- ing patient-specific biases. We examined model embeddings to gain insights into transcriptomic alterations induced by T1D.

**Results:**
The foundation model outperformed logistic regression in distinguishing T1D from non-diabetic cells. The analysis highlighted B2M, HLA class I and genes of the type 1 interferon response as highly informative in identifying T1D cells in both alpha and delta popula- tions. However, the interferon response was highly variable among donors and in cells of the same donor. The extent of the iterferon response was generally correlated between alpha and delta cells of the same donors.Alpha cells from T1D donors with high interferon response displayed upregulation of , , coding for Chor- mograninA and Glucagon, and genes in protein synthesis and secretion pathways. In contrast, alpha cells from T1D donors with low interferon activity exhibited an upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism of reactive oxygen species pathways but no evidence for alpha cell de-differentiation compared to cells from healthy donors. Similar results were observed in delta cells.

**Conclusion:**
Elevated HLA gene expression in islet endocrine cells is linked to insulin-containing islets and an early stage of T1D. By analyzing the single-cell interferon response, we mapped transcrip- tomic changes in alpha and delta cells over T1D progression. During early disease phases, heightened interferon activity is associated with protein synthesis pathways. As the response declines, metabolic path- way alterations emerge, potentially as a result of hyperglycemia and/or changes in insulin signaling, contributing to alpha cell dysfunction. Our analysis outlines the pathophysiology of T1D in alpha and delta cells, from early disease stages to the elimination of beta cells.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased severity and mortality from respiratory virus infec- tions, including SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination in the general population significantly reduces the risk of severe respiratory viral infection and triggers a strong, polyfunctional and lasting T cell response in healthy individuals. However, vaccine effectiveness in people with diabetes is unclear. Here aimed to study the magnitude and functional character- istics of vaccine-specific ­CD4 and ­CD8 T cell responses to the full vaccination protocol, and the recall response after a third booster dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and compared them to those of people without diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVAC-DM study participants at various time points and analyzed them by flow cytometry using activation-induced markers to identify vaccine-specific T cells.

**Results:**
We found defects in both ­CD4 and ­CD8 T cell memory maintenance and the functionality of the vaccine specific T cells in people with diabetes compared to people without. In those individu- als with diabetes that harbored detectable vaccine-specific T cells, they displayed an unfocused, tolerogenic phenotype characterized by increased expression of IL-13 and IL-10 in T1D and T2D compared to people without diabetes

**Conclusion:**
These results have implications for vaccination strategies for people with diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Inflammation in the early stages of islet trans- plantation is a key factor contributing to islet damage and loss. This may be driven by the Instant Blood-Mediated Inflammatory Reac- tion (IBMIR), a cascade of innate immune responses involving the coagulation system, complement system, platelets, and immune cells. This immunothrombotic environment promotes neutrophil activation, potentially leading to the release of decondensed chromatin in the form of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which amplify inflam- mation. While NETs are implicated in diabetes-related complications, their role in IBMIR remains largely unexplored. This study investi- gates the contribution of NETs to IBMIR and their impact on islet graft survival.

**Materials and methods:**
NET-deficient mice were generated via Padi4 ablation, a key enzyme in chromatin decondensation, using a Cre-Lox strategy. Islets were isolated from wild-type C57Bl/6j mice, and diabetes was induced in Padi4KO and Floxed control mice with a single 175 mg/kg intraperitoneal streptozotocin injection. Bone mar- row neutrophils were isolated via negative immunomagnetic selection, and liver cell suspensions were analyzed by flow cytometry. Gene expression was quantified by qPCR. Syngeneic marginal islet trans- plantation was performed in diabetic Padi4KO and Floxed mice via intraportal injection of 250-300 islets. Citrullinated histone H3 was assessed by western blot. Human peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors. Human islet-conditioned media were collected from islets isolated from heart-beating cadaveric multiorgan donors and purified using the Ricordi automated method.

**Results:**
Conditioned medium from both human and mouse islets, particularly from less pure fractions, induced a marked increase in IL-1β expression in neutrophils. Padi4KO neutrophils, which were transcriptionally similar to Floxed neutrophils, did not release NETs and exhibited significantly lower IL-1β levels in response to islet- conditioned medium. Similarly, human neutrophils treated with a Padi4 inhibitor showed a significant reduction in IL-1β levels. Base- line metabolic characterization confirmed that Padi4 deletion did not affect islet size or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Following diabetes induction, Padi4KO and Floxed mice exhibited comparable blood glucose levels (353 ± 33 vs. 377 ± 17 mg/dl, p = 0.51). Islet transplantation triggered neutrophil recruitment to the liver and was associated with the accumulation of citrullinated histone H3. Nota- bly, diabetic Padi4KO mice that received islet transplants exhibited a sustained reduction in blood glucose compared to Floxed controls (185 ± 21 vs. 235 ± 21 mg/dl, p < 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that NETs contribute to islet loss post-transplantation by intensifying inflammation. Targeting NETs may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance and preserve islet function and improve long-term transplant outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Pancreas transplantation represents a solid approach to restore long-term normoglycemia in diabetic patients by replenishment of beta cell functional mass. To date, the long-term safety and efficacy of pancreas transplant alone (PTA) in T1D are still debated.

**Materials and methods:**
In our centre, from May 1996 to December 2024, 442 pancreas transplants have been performed. Of them, about 25% were PTA. In the present study, we report the outcomes of PTA as performed in our centre, after 20-year actual follow-up. Thirty- nine consecutive patients were studied (re-transplants excluded), having the following clinical characteristics at time of transplant: age: 38 ± 8.5 years; 20 males and 19 females; BMI: 23.9 ± 3.1 kg/ m ; duration of T1D: 25 ± 10.4 years; fasting C-peptide values: 0.1 ± 0.2 ng/ml; insulin requirement: 45 ± 11.8 IU/day; eGFR 104.7 ± 37.6 mL/min/1.73m . PTA was performed with portal-enteric drain- age. The anti-rejection induction therapy included high dose steroids and either basiliximab or anti-thymocyte globulin (in 92.3% and 7.7% of cases, respectively). In the maintenance phase, tacrolimus, mycophenolate and low-dose prednisone were used.

**Results:**
After 20-year actual follow-up, patient survival was 74% (29/39 patients). Based on the “International Pancreas & Islet Trans- plant Association” criteria, death censored pancreas graft function was excellent or good respectively in nineteen (49%) and three (8%) patients. In them, glycated hemoglobin was 5.7 ± 0.7 % and fasting C-peptide was 2.8 ± 1.6 ng/mL. During the follow-up, 9 patients developed end stage renal disease (ESRD) and 4 of them received kidney transplantation. eGFR decline in subjects with functioning graft was about 40% slower than in patients with pancreas graft loss. The average time from PTA to onset of ESRD was 15 ± 4.8 years. The eGFR in the remaining patients was 60.7±19.1 mL/min/1.73m .

**Conclusion:**
These actual 20-yr results show that PTA is an effec- tive and reasonably safe option to cure diabetes in selected cases of T1D patients.

**Background and aims:**
ADO12 is an implantable and fully retriev- able scaffold for islet transplantation without immunosuppression. It is based on a permselective hydrogel film allowing insulin diffu- sion while preventing immune cell invasion and antibody contact. Allogenic transplant of rat islets in immunocompetent diabetic rats has already demonstrated encapsulated islets survival, insulin secre- tion, and glycemic regulation. Compatibility with human islets and scalability to deliver a therapeutic dose were studied to meet require- ments for a first in human study.

**Materials and methods:**
ADO12 is a non-degradable hydrogel cross-linked by bio-orthogonal chemistry. It is reinforced with a sur- gical mesh and sandwiched in a suturable silicon ring. Human islets were encapsulated in ADO12. In vitro functionality was evaluated using perifusion assay or static glucose stimulated secretion assay. In four studies, NXG-mice were implanted in the peritoneum with two implants.

**Results:**
In vitro, ADO12 Human Islets has shown gluco-respon- sive insulin, amylin, and glucagon. Insulin secretion is maintained up to 4 months. In vivo, ADO12 Human Islets was evaluated in immunodeficient mice. Human C-peptide secretion increased dur- ing the first two weeks to reach an average of 707±218 pM that was maintained in 100% of mice until explantation after more than 2 months (20 mice, 4 studies). Moreover, ADO12 Human Islets was shown to regulate mouse glycemia to human levels (10 mice, 2 studies). In vitro, explants (n=15) maintained 100% of secretion indexes and 78% of insulin secretion levels compared to preimplantation values. ADO12 was optimized to fit the cur- rent clinical workflow and timelines. The simple manufacturing could be performed at islet isolation centers. Preliminary data sug- gest that it yields homogenous 3D-distribution of viable islets. ADO12 geometry and high resistance to mechanical constraints are compatible with implantation via laparoscopy, as demonstrated in domestic pig.

**Conclusion:**
ADO12 is suitable for human islets delivery showing no fibrosis and sustained islet functionality.

**Background and aims:**
One-third of chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients who undergo total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplanta- tion (TPIAT) achieve insulin independence. Little is known regarding diabetes (DM) related genetics on TPIAT. Genetic risk scores (GRS) are utilized in type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) DM to predict C-peptide (Cpep) before diagnosis.

**Materials and methods:**
We genotyped 384 patients with CP who underwent TPIAT enrolled in the multicenter “POST” study using the Global Screening Array to assess the influence of T1D and T2D GRS and 14 pre-specified SNPs associated with Cpep preservation on 1 year TPIAT outcomes.

**Results:**
Patients were 30 ± 17 years, 62% female, 92% Caucasian, 13% previously had DM and received 4294 ± 3458 IEQ/kg during TPIAT. One year post TPIAT 80% required insulin, fasting Cpep was 0.98 ± 0.79 ng/mL and insulin dose adjusted A1c (IDAA1C) was 8.4 ± 2.8. Having diabetes before TPIAT was associated with higher T1D GRS1 (mean Z-score 0.27 ± 0.8 vs -0.04 ± 1.0 in non-DM, p=0.03) and higher T2D GRS (mean Z-score 0.52 ± 1.2 vs -0.07 ± 1.0, p=0.003). At 1 year after TPIAT higher T2D GRS was associated with a lower fasting Cpep (β=-0.09 per 1 SD, p=0.04) and higher IDAA1C (β=0.45 per 1 SD, p=0.009). Several pre-selected SNPs had a trend of lower mean fasting Cpep 1 year post TPIAT (Table).

**Conclusion:**
Genetic risk factors for T1D and T2D may impact the risk for DM in CP and insulin secretion after TPIAT.

**Background and aims:**
Total pancreatectomy with autologous islet transplantation (TPAIT) has been proposed as an alternative to high- risk pancreatic anastomosis after pacreaticoduodenectomy for preven- tion of surgical complications, while maintaining low risks to develop brittle pancreatogenic diabetes. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) pro- files and TPAIT outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
Between September 2023 and March 2025, 10 patients with pancreatic neoplasia underwent TPAIT (males/females 5/5, age 60 [IQR 55-68] years, islet infusion 1912 [IQR 1724 - 3074] IEQ/kg) at a University Hospital. At 3 (n=10), 6 (n=8) and 12 months (n=6) after TPAIT, CGM profiles were collected, and islet metabolic function was assessed through the most recent Igls-derived criteria and BETA-2 score. CGM metrics were compared across Igls categories.

**Results:**
Igls criteria layered islet function across available time points (n=24) as optimal (n=10), good (n=6), marginal (n=7) and failure (n=1). BETA-2 score progressively fell across the 4 Igls categories (median [IQR] 19.4 [17.7-19.8], 13.6 [11.8-15.7], 5.3 [2.2-11.9], 1.42, respectively; p=0.001). In CGM profiles, optimal vs good and marginal outcomes showed significantly higher time in range (TIR) and in tight range (TITR) (TIR: 97.0% vs 75.5%, p 0.004, and 70.0%, p 0.005; TITR: 86.5% vs 41.0%, p=0.004, and 40.0%, p=0.005), and lower time above range (TAR) and glycemia risk index (GRI) (TAR: 1.5% vs 24.5%, p=0.003, and 29.0%, p <0.001; GRI: 4.0 vs 22.0, p=0.007, and 32.0, p=0.009). Spearman’s correlation analyses (rho) confirmed inverse associations of Igls stages with TIR and TITR (-0.566, p=0.005 and -0.684, p<0.001, respectively) and positive associations with TAR, CV and GRI (0.598, p=0.003; 0.460, p=0.025; 0.508, p=0.013, respectively). TIR, TITR, TAR, CV and GRI showed consistent asso- ciations also with BETA-2 score (0.813, 0.859, -0.828, -0.688, -0.735, all p<0.001, respectively), and with infused islet equivalents (0.502, p=0.013; 0.586, p=0.003; -0.585, p=0.003; -0.530, p=0.009; -0.456, p=0.026, respectively).

**Conclusion:**
Optimal islet function after TPAIT, as assessed by Igls or BETA-2 score, was associated with longer time spent in euglycemia and lower time spent in hyperglycemia, as documented by CGM. Sev- eral CGM metrics, including TIR, TITR, TAR and GRI, were strongly and consistently related with Igls and BETA-2 score, thereby possi- bly validating their roles of good clinical indicators of islet glucose competence.

**Background and aims:**
Subcutaneous polymeric scaffolds for insulin- producing cell transplantation require a microenvironment that includes supportive extracellular matrix (ECM) alongside a robust vascular network to ensure adequate oxygen, nutrient delivery, and insulin transport. This study evaluated adipose-derived stromal cell (ASC) secretome for fostering such a scaffold microenvironment.

**Materials and methods:**
Rat ASCs were exposed to various cul- ture conditions to determine the alterations in the composition and functional properties of their secretomes. Subsequently, secretome- containing scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in a non-diabetic immunocompromised rat model and on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 the microenvironment was investigated by lectin infusion, gene expression analysis, and histology.

**Results:**
Exposure of ASCs to normoxia, hypoxia, or a combination of hypoxia + high glucose resulted in enrichment of secretome proteins associated with angiogenesis and ECM organization. These conditions also stimulated in vitro endothelial tube formation (number of branch- ing points 1.3-2.4 times higher than the control) and collagen deposi- tion by fibroblasts (1.7-2.2 times increase in collagen staining than the control). In vivo experiments demonstrated that all three secretomes enhanced the formation of a vascular network and ECM deposition within the scaffold. Notably, the most significant improvement was observed with the hypoxia + high glucose-derived secretome. Start- ing from day 14, this secretome significantly increased pro-angiogenic genes like VEGF (1.7-2.5 fold change), Angiopoietin1 (1.3-1.6 fold change), and Ve-Cadherin (1.4-1.6 fold change), and the presence of perfused blood vessels (1.4-5 fold change). Furthermore, the gene expression of several matrix metalloproteinases and the protein expres- sion of Collagen IV and Laminin were improved.

**Conclusion:**
By modifying the ASC secretome, it becomes highly suit- able for engineering a sustainable microenvironment within a subcuta- neous scaffold which might enhance Type 1 Diabetes transplantation outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Islet transplantation is considered to be the ideal solution for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus such as type 1 diabetes mellitus. The current research hotspot is the use of hydrogel to encapsulate islet cells to establish an immune isolation barrier so that the transplanted islet cells remain active and functional. However, traditional hydrogel transplantation requires invasive surgery, which causes large trauma to the organism. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a hydrogel system that can be used for minimally inva- sive transplantation of pancreatic islets.

**Materials and methods:**
In this study, we prepared hydrogel scaffolds based on microfluidic technology and extracted primary pancreatic islets from C57BL/6 mice wrapped in the scaffolds. After that, we prepared self- healing hydrogels based on Schiff base bonding and wrapped HUVECs. The microstructure of the two hydrogels was observed using a scanning electron microscope, and the rheological properties of the hydrogels were examined using a rheometer. The two components of the hydrogels were transplanted into diabetic mice, and the blood glucose of the animals was continuously monitored for 100 days, and the glucose tolerance of the mice was monitored using the IPGTT assay. At the endpoint of the experi- ment, the mice were sacrificed, and tissue sections were taken from the transplantation sites, and HE staining was performed to observe the gross morphology, and immunofluorescence staining for insulin, glucagon, and CD31 was performed to observe the function of the grafts.

**Results:**
Based on the precise and manipulable characteristics of microfluidic technology, we prepared standardized hydrogel scaffolds for islet cell encapsulation, whose compact microstructure can provide mechanical support and immuno-isolation for islet cells. The rheologi- cal properties confirmed the injectability and self-repairing properties of the self-healing hydrogel, while its loose and porous structure con- tributed to the formation of vascularization. The addition of HUVEC can effectively improve islet cell function and promote islet cell sur- vival in vitro. observation revealed that the islet cells in the vascularized hydrogel group had the strongest cell viability and the longest survival time , and were able to effectively reduce blood glucose and restore glucose tolerance. Histology also confirmed that the grafts were capable of sustained insulin and glucagon secretion and improved vascularization of the transplantation sites.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, we constructed an injectable vascularized hydrogel for minimally invasive transplantation of pancreatic islets. Transplantation was effective in improving hyperglycemia and promoting angiogenesis in diabetic animals. This will provide new cell therapy, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine new strategies for diabetes treatment.

**Breaking immune evasion: NK cell surveillance of hypoimmuno- genic pancreatic islets under viral challange**

G. Siracusano, ­Sordi, M. De ­Giovanni, L. ­Piemonti

1. Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, San Raffaele Sci-

**Background and aims:**
Immune-evasive induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived islets are being developed as a promising cell ther- apy for type 1 diabetes (T1D). While abrogation of MHC-I prevents ­CD8 T cell killing, it exposes the graft to natural killer (NK) cell destruction via missing-self recognition. Prior strategies attempted to mitigate NK responses by expressing inhibitory ligands but yielded inconsistent results due to the heterogeneity of NK cell populations. We devised an alternative strategy targeting NK cell activation by geneti- cally ablating B7-H3 and CD155 ligands in MHC-I iPSCs (triple knockout, T-KO). Differentiated T-KO pancreatic islets successfully evaded both T and NK cell-mediated rejection and restored glycemic control in diabetic mice. However, the safety of hypoimmune iPSC- islets in the context of infection remains uncertain. To investigate this, we evaluated immunosurveillance by challenging T-KO islets with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE).

**Materials and methods:**
hIL-15 NOG mice transplanted with lucif- erase-expressing T-KO islets were humanized with NK cells (day 10) and infected with 1x10 ffu/mouse of LCMV-WE (day 24). Non- humanized and uninfected mice were used as controls. Acute infection was assessed by platelet count 7 days post-infection (p.i.), while viral titers, immunophenotyping, and hC-peptide levels were evaluated 3 and 7 days p.i.. Graft survival was analyzed by IVIS and explanted organs examined at the endpoint.

**Results:**
Thrombocytopenia indicated acute LCMV-WE infection. Viral titers were higher in NK-humanized mice compared to controls. Interestingly, hC-peptide significantly decreased in humanized mice, correlating with the bioluminescence decrease of T-KO islets. Impor- tantly, we found that NK cells were responsible for graft rejection, as we detected CD56+ cells at the graft site. Mechanistic evaluations confirmed that NK cell activation and recognition of islet cells were NKG2D-dependent, with LCMV-WE infection causing the upregula- tion of the NKG2D-activating ligands MICA/B and ULBP3 in T-KO islets.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights that the upregulation of activating ligands other than B7-H3 and CD155 enables NK cells to re-engage in missing-self recognition, targeting infected cells. Considering the potential for viral escape, further investigations are warranted using viruses with pancreatic islet tropism to comprehensively assess the safety of hypoimmune iPSC-islets for clinical applications.

**Progression from stage 2 to stage 3 type 1 diabetes in children identified by general population screening**

M. Rewers, K.M. Simmons, A. Steck, B. Frohnert

**Background and aims:**
Stage 2 type 1 diabetes (T1D), defined by islet autoantibodies (IAbs) and dysglycemia, is the indication for teplizumab therapy in persons ≥8 y of age. Currently available risk estimates of progression from stage 2 to stage 3 T1D are largely derived from clinical trials in relatives, ≥8 y of age, of people with T1D. We are reporting the risk of progression and its predictors in children 1-17-year-old identified from the general population by screening for IAbs.

**Materials and methods:**
Between 2017-2025, Autoimmunity Screening for Kids (ASK) screened 36 855 children 1-17 y of age for early pre-symptomatic T1D. Their age, sex, and race/ethnicity reflected the underlying Colorado population. IAbs to insulin, GAD, IA-2, and ZnT8 were measured using both standard radiobinding assay and electrochemiluminescence assay. Screening positive chil- dren were invited to a confirmation visit that included IAbs, A1c, random blood glucose, and detailed review of symptoms. Children confirmed positive for multiple or single IAbs by both assays were monitored for dysglycemia using CGM, OGTT, and A1c as well as received caregiver education on glucometer testing, symptoms, and prevention of DKA

**Results:**
At the initial screening or confirmation, 35 (0.095%) of the children met the ADA criteria for stage 2 T1D. During the follow- up, an additional 98 children progressed to stage 2 T1D. Of the 133 children identified with stage 2 (by A1c or OGTT, ADA criteria), 56% were female, 53% non-Hispanic white, and 81% did not have a relative with T1D. At diagnosis of stage 2, multiple IAbs were present in 56% of the children, the median age was 11 y [IQR 9-14] and A1c was 5.7% [5.6-5.8%]. During a median 15 [4-39] months of follow-up, 44/133 (33%) of the children progressed to stage 3; one (2.3%) had DKA at diagnosis. Progression to clinical diabetes was faster in children with initial multiple IAbs: HR 3.9 (95%CI 1.8-8.6) and higher A1c: HR 1.4 (1.1-1.8 per 0.2%) in a multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity and family history of T1D. The Figure illus- trates progression from stage 2 to stage 3 by IAb status (panel A) and age (panel B). The risk of progression to insulin dependence in 2 years from detection of stage 2 was 52% (41-65%) in children positive for multiple IAbs, compared to 15% (7-29%) in those with a single IAb (p<0.0001). The risk of progression to insulin dependence in 2 years from detection of stage 2 was higher in children younger than 8 y: 54% (34-76%), compared to those 8 y or older: 32% (24-43%) (p=0.022). To date, seven children have received teplizumab infusion, including two younger than 8 y enrolled in the PETITE-T1D trial.

**Conclusion:**
In this population-based screening program, family his- tory of T1D, race/ethnicity or sex of the child did not influence the rate of progression from stage 2 to stage 3. Children positive for multiple IAbs and those younger than 8 y experienced faster progression.

**Factors associated with slower progression to stage 3 type 1 diabe- tes in children with multiple islet autoantibodies**

H. Elding Larsson

**Background and aims:**
Multiple islet autoantibodies, but not yet clini- cal type 1 diabetes, is considered to be an early stage of disease; stage 1 while glucose tolerance is normal, stage 2 if glucose tolerance is impaired. With new screening initiatives for early stages of type 1 diabetes, the need for better prediction of stage 3 type 1 diabetes is increasing, to guide intensiveness in follow up and attempts of preven- tion. The aim of this study was to explore potential factors associated with slower progression to stage 3 type 1 diabetes among children with multiple islet antibodies (stage 1 or 2 type 1 diabetes).

**Materials and methods:**
Two randomized clinical trials, Diabetes Pre- vention Immune Tolerance (DIAPREV-IT) 1 and 2, were initiated at Skåne University hospital in 2009 and 2015, respectively. The studies aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of GAD-Alum on progression to stage 3 type 1 diabetes, both failing to demonstrate a significant treatment effect. In total, 76 children participated in the two trials, 4-17.9 (median 6.4) years of age at inclusion, with at least two islet autoantibodies, of which one was GADA. Children were fol- lowed every ­3 month for a minimum of 2 years. OGTT was performed at baseline, at 6 months and thereafter annually. In 2024, a follow-up study on progression to type 1 diabetes after the initial study follow-up was performed. This study analyzed data from four different timepoints aiming to explore factors associated with non-progression.

**Results:**
During a median follow-up of 12.7 (6.6-14.8) years, 47 of 76 (61.8%) of the children were diagnosed with stage 3 type 1 diabe- tes. The median time of progression was 4.9 (0.03-13. 5) years, and median age at diagnosis 11.7 (5.6-26.7) years. The association between baseline characteristics and time to stage 3 type 1 diabetes was ana- lyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age and sex. A faster progression was associated with higher number of islet autoantibodies (>2 HR 2.5, p=0.019, >3 HR 2.8, p=0.002), presence and titer of IA-2A (HR 2.1, p=0.05, titer: HR 1.6, p=0.004) and the three variants of ZnT8A (ZnT8RA: HR 2.1, p=0.026, titer: HR 1.4, p=0.027, ZnT8WA: HR 2.3, p=0.007, titer: HR 1.3, p=0.049, ZnT8QA HR: 2.2, p=0.010, titer: HR 1.6, p=0.003). A normal neutrophil count (>1.6 ­x10 /L) at baseline was associated with a slower progression (HR 0.62, p=0.014), compared to those with lower neutrophil count. In time-varying covariate Cox proportional hazard models the fol- lowing factors were associated with faster progression: 1) female sex (HR (95%CI)= 2.4 (1.2-4.7) p=0.014), 2) stage 2 type 1 diabetes (2.6 (1.2 - 5.5) p=0.014), 3) higher HbA1c (1.2 (CI 1.0-1.3) p=0.028), 4) higher BMI SDS (1.7 (CI 1.1-2.6) p=0.018). In contrast, an early C-peptide response on OGTT, defined as the difference in C-peptide between baseline and 30 min after intake of glucose, was associated with a slower progression (0.15 (CI 0.05-0.46) p<0.001). The rate of progression was not found to be associated with having a first-degree relative or high-risk HLA DQ-genotype.

**Conclusion:**
Eight factors were associated with a slower progression: 1) male sex, 2) stage 1 type 1 diabetes, 3) normal BMI SDS, 4) low HbA1c, 5) high early C-peptide response, 6) normal neutrophil count at baseline, 7) a lower number of autoantibodies, 8) lack of IA-2A and ZnT8A. BMI SDS stands out as a potentially influenceable protective factor needing further investigation.

**Background and aims:**
The natural history of type 1 diabetes is well characterised in children; those with two or more islet autoantibodies under the age of 5 years have >80% risk of developing type 1 diabetes by the age of 20 years. Yet more than half of type 1 diabetes is diag- nosed in adults and the natural history is under investigated. The Type 1 Diabetes Risk in Adults (T1DRA) study was established to recruit 20,000 UK adults for islet autoantibody screening and monitoring of single and multiple islet autoantibody positive individuals to explore risk of future type 1 diabetes in adults.

**Materials and methods:**
T1DRA study participants consent online and are sent a capillary blood collection kit for remote sampling by post. Serum samples are screened for islet autoantibodies using a Lucif- erase Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS) triplex assay (truncated (t) GADA/IA-2A/ZnT8A)screening followed by testing positives in single assays and a radiobinding assay for IAA. Positive results (>99 percen- tile for all assays) are then confirmed in a separate sample. Participants are provided education about type 1 diabetes and invited to annual follow up.

**Results:**
As of 01 April 2025, 9013 adults between 18 and 70 years (median age 41 years) had consented. Of these, 45% have a relative (first or second degree) with type 1 diabetes. There is a 67% return rate for samples; 7% had serum <15μl requiring a repeat sample. The remainder had serum volumes ranging from 15μl - 450μl with a median of 100μl. To date 5328 results have been reported. Of these, 211 (3.8%) participants have been confirmed positive for islet autoantibodies in a separate sample; 31 (0.6%) are multiple islet autoantibody positive. tGADA are the most prevalent autoantibody and represent 55% of sin- gle autoantibody positives while 13% are positive for IAA and 13% for ZnT8A. Only 3% are positive for single IA-2A. All positive participants have agreed to annual follow up including metabolic monitoring by remote HbA1c.

**Conclusion:**
The adult population harbours single and multiple islet autoantibody positive individuals. tGADA are the most prevalent islet autoantibody; IAA are unexpectedly common. Follow up of all posi- tive individuals will allow risk assessment to be improved in adults.

**Background and aims:**
Paediatric screening programmes are occur- ring globally to identify children with pre-symptomatic Type 1 Dia- betes. Benefits of screening include diabetic ketoacidosis prevention, facilitating entry to immunoprevention trials and access to approved therapies where eligible. In this systematic review, we synthesise the evidence regarding the psychosocial impact, acceptability and ethics of screening for paediatric Type 1 Diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, APA PsychInfo, ASSIA, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus and ref- erence lists for quantitative, mixed methods and qualitative studies until ­22 November 2024. No limits were applied to language or country. Studies were included if the child participated in a paedi- atric T1D screening programme and emotional, cognitive, behav- ioural and social implications or acceptability for the parent and/or child were assessed. We used the mixed methods appraisal tool and critical appraisal skills checklists for quality assessment. We per- formed a mixed methods evidence synthesis, identifying key themes from qualitative data and merging with quantitative data to generate meta-inferences.

**Results:**
Sixty-three articles (10 qualitative, 52 quantitative and one mixed-methods) involving 62,197 parents and 251 children aged 8-18 years were included. Twelve articles (19.0%) met all quality criteria (high quality), 42 (66.7%) met 60-80% of criteria (moderate qual- ity), 8 (12.7%) met 40% of criteria and 1 (1.6%) met 20% of criteria (low quality). We generated five themes and 18 sub-themes. Risk notification resulted in anxiety, which waned over time but could recur. Cognitive implications included initially accurate risk recall but risk underestimation set-in during follow-up. Behavioural strate- gies comprised symptom checking and medical monitoring. Overall, parents valued knowing their child’s risk and perceived benefits to outweigh harms although paediatric sampling was considered chal- lenging. Ethics of screening centred on the right to results disclosure and joint decision-making with the child.

**Conclusion:**
This, the most comprehensive review of the literature to date, demonstrates that despite the emotional, cognitive and behav- ioural implications of screening, parents found screening for paediat- ric type 1 diabetes to be broadly acceptable, and the process ethical.

**Correlation of home monitoring and in clinic C-peptide values in patients with new onset type 1 diabetes**

T. Triolo, Skeens, A.K. Steck, H.W. Davidson

**Background and aims:**
Understanding factors associated with C-peptide (CP) preservation in type 1 diabetes (T1D) may aid inter- ventions in the partial remission period. Fasting and stimulated CP or urinary CP to creatinine ratio (UCPCR) measure residual beta cell function.

**Materials and methods:**
We utilized home monitoring CP collection with volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) and a simplified mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Patients collected fasting and 90 minute CP VAMS after a standardized meal. We characterized cor- relation of VAMS MMTT CP with in-clinic random serum CP and UCPCR.

**Results:**
We enrolled 34 islet autoantibody positive (Ab+) participants within 6 months of T1D onset. Age of T1D was 11.3 ± 3.4 years, 50% were female, 85.3% were ≥2 Ab+ and 14.7% single Ab+. HbA1c was 11.4 ± 2.9% at diagnosis and 6.3 ± 0.9% at enrollment. 53% of patients were diagnosed in diabetic ketoacidosis. Serum CP and UCPCR were collected at initial in clinic visit. Participants completed a VAMS MMTT 10-14 days after enrollment. Random in clinic serum CP corre- lated with home fasting ­(R =0.39, p=0.0005) and stimulated ­(R =0.66, p<0.0001) CP. Random UCPCR did not correlate with serum or VAMS MMTT CP (Figure).

**Conclusion:**
VAMS MMTT home collection correlated with in clinic random CP but not UCPCR, suggesting more standardized collection may be required than used in this study. VAMS home CP monitoring may be useful for longitudinal clinical research studies.

4. Ancona, Italy, Federazione Italiana Medici Pediatri, Naples, Italy, San

**Background and aims:**
The D1Ce Screen pilot study stems from the Italian Republic Law 130/2023 introducing the screening for pre- symptomatic type 1 diabetes (T1D) and/or undiagnosed coeliac disease (CD) in the general paediatric population using autoantibody measure- ment on capillary blood. Early detection aims to mitigate the com- plications associated with late or missed diagnosis of these diseases on affected individuals and the healthcare system.Primary objective is to assess, on a smaller scale, feasibility, acceptability and sustain- ability of a nationwide screening program within the Italian National Health Service.Specifically, D1Ce Screen assesses operational aspects, including the involvement of primary care paediatricians (PCPs), blood sample collection accuracy and acceptability for families measuring anxiety, depression and quality of life through three existing validated questionnaires.

**Materials and methods:**
This is an observational multicenter study to screen a sample of 5,363 children across four Italian regions (Lom- bardy, Marche, Campania, Sardinia), distributed into three classes of age (2-2.9, 6-6.9, and 10-10.9 years), corresponding to reported peaks of seroconversion for these diseases. Screening is conducted by volun- tary PCPs, responsible for recruitment of participants, administration of informed consents and questionnaires, execution of blood drawing by finger prick, capillary blood collection and sample shipment.Spe- cific T1D and CD autoantibodies are measured in capillary samples by ELISA and LIPS, with comparative evaluation. In addition, HLA DQ2 and DQ8 HLA typing for CD susceptibility is performed on dried blood spot (DBS).

**Results:**
PCPs initially accepting invitation to participate were 565, with 428 (75.7%) completing the study. Enrolled children were 5534, with 5044 (91.1%) within the target age range and 490 in other ages (Table 1). The gender distribution was 49.4% females and 50.6% males. Samples suitable for analysis (adequacy for at least one assay) accounted for 89% of the total collected. All DBS samples were suit- able for HLA typing. Questionnaires were administered to more than the 2% target families

**Conclusion:**
The D1Ce Screen pilot supports feasibility of the national program. The active involvement of PCPs, a high participation response by families, and an efficient capillary blood sample collection were the key factors for success. These preliminary results support the potential for large-scale implementation of the paediatric screening program for T1D and CD within the Italian National Health Service

**Background and aims:**
The onset of hypoglycemia as a consequence of impaired insulin secretion might be considered a sign of future impaired glicemia regulation. The aim was to investigate the signifi- cance of autoimmunity in patients with hypoglycemia, and the possible presence of insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS). IAS is commonly present in patients with other autoimmune diseases such as thyroid disease. The role in the development of prediabetes [impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG)] or diabetes (DM) was also studied.

**Materials and methods:**
Non-diabetic patients presenting with repeated hypoglycemias were included in the study. Insulinoma was excluded based on prolonged oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 48-hour fasting test. IGT was diagnosed if 2-hour plasma glucose (PG) concentrations were 7.8 to 11.1 mmol/L and IFG if the FPG was ≥6.1 mmol/L and the 2-hour PG was <7.8 mmol/L. OGTT was performed over an 8-10 mo period during 5 yrs. Antibodies (Abs) to antigens of the pancreatic islet beta cells (ICA), glutamic acid decarboxylase Abs (GAD), thyroid Abs: thyroid peroxidase Abs and thyroglobulin Abs, fasting and postprandial insulin and C-peptide, insulin resistance (IR), and other metabolic syndrome parameters were determined in patients with hypoglycemia. Presence of DM in their relatives was also assessed.

**Results:**
A statistically significant difference was determined in the number of patients with hypoglycemia according to the presence of pancreatic and thyroid Abs. Pancreatic Abs were present in 34 (38.64%) and thyroid Abs in 20 patients (22.73%) of the 88 patients (chi2=4.98; df=1;p=0.0256). Of the total number of patients, both pancreatic and thyroid Abs were present in 12 (13.64%) patients, meaning that 35.29% of patients with pancreatic Abs (N=34), also had thyroid Abs. There was no difference in the presence of DM in relatives according to the presence of pancreatic Abs. A stepwise logistic regression pro- cedure whit the dependent dichotomous variable developed ITG_DM showed that the only statistically significant predictor was postpran- dial C-peptide, OR=2.807 ; 95CI (1.551,5.333) with an area under the curve of ROC 0.747. This indicates that increase in postprandial C-peptide by one unit increases the odds ratio for developing ITG_DM by 2.28 times. No significant difference (p<0.05) was found between the group of patients according to the presence of pancreatic Abs in: body mass index, IR, fasting and postprandial C-peptide and insulin, C-reactive protein, uric acid, high-density and low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides.

**Conclusion:**
The presence of pancreatic and thyroid Abs was observed in patients suffering from hypoglycemia, suggesting the presence of IAS in these individuals. An increase in postprandiale C-peptide emerged as the main predictor for the development of prediabetes and DM.

**Background and aims:**
ICA assays were the original test developed to screen for islet autoimmunity and diagnostically classify type 1 diabetes. Following the identification of humoral autoimmunity to GAD and IA-2 antigens and development of high-performance anti- gen-specific immunoassays, ICA assays were largely superseded. Both GAD and IA-2 have been confirmed as major contributors of ICA reac- tivity, but the contribution of the third major islet antigen in type 1 diabetes, ZnT8, identified in 2007, has never been investigated. We sought to 1) determine the contribution of ZnT8 to the ICA complex and 2) investigate whether the genotype (rs13266634) of the pancreas donor, that determines ZnT8A specificity, can influence ICA reactivity.

**Materials and methods:**
Anonymised sera (<1-yr from diagnosis) from a well-characterised UK type 1 diabetes registry (ADDRESS-2) were selected if single ZnT8A positive by monomeric R325-ZnT8/ W325-ZnT8 RIAs (n=22 with various levels of ZnT8A positivity and specificity). Healthy human pancreas (n=2, O neg blood group; 17/19 years of age, M/F, 4μM sections) were genotyped (rs13266634; RR/RW). Sensitivity of both pancreases was calibrated to the international JDF ICA standard (NIBSC 97/550) and end-point titration results were quantitively expressed as JDF units (JDFu), where ≥20JDFu was considered positive. Quality control samples were run in all assays and sera were run on both pancreases in parallel.

**Results:**
Of 22 single ZnT8A sera, 19 (86.4%) were ICA positive on both the RR/RW pancreases (range 20-320JDFu). This included R325-specific (n=5), W325-specific (n=4), and non-spe- cific (n=10) ZnT8A. The JDFu of selected R325-specific and non- specific ZnT8A varied up to two-fold between pancreas donors, but W325-specific ZnT8A ranged from two-fold up to four-fold. This suggests that there are differences in ZnT8A binding according to the pancreatic genotype, particularly W325-specific ZnT8A. The binding of W325-specific ZnT8A to the RR pancreas donor further supports that non-polymorphic epitopes are important. The 3 sera found ICA negative (0-5JDFu) on both pancreases, were low- level R325-specific (n=2) and W325-specific (n=1) ZnT8A by RIA and therefore, are difficult to detect by immunofluorescence.

**Conclusion:**
For the first time, we show that ZnT8 does contribute to ICA complexes and that genotype could influence both the assay and diagnostic sensitivity of ICA. This is important as ICA assays are still performed in some research and clinical laboratories, includ- ing the UK National Health Service, primarily using primate pancreas (RR ), due to the limited availability of healthy human pan- creas donors. Elucidating the antigenic components measured by ICA remains important for understanding islet autoimmunity.

**Background and aims:**
Proinflammatory cytokines, including Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), Interleukin-1 beta (IL1β), and Interferon- gamma (IFNγ), play a significant role in beta cell apoptosis during type 1 diabetes, with interferon signalling implicated in the early stages of disease pathogenesis. Radical S-adenosyl methionine domain contain- ing 2 ( /Viperin) is an IFN-inducible gene that forms part of the innate immune system and is highly enriched in beta cells exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines or viral infection. However, the role of Viperin in beta cell inflammation is not clear.

**Materials and methods:**
Rat INS-1 832/13 (INS-1) cells were treated with a combination of rat pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα (400U/ ml), IL1β (400U/ml), IFNγ (200U/ml)) over 6-24h, and mRNA or pro- tein levels analysed by qPCR, RNASeq or western blotting. Human islets from two donors (supplied by Islet Core, University of Alberta, under established ethics approvals) were treated with human IFNα (2000U/ml) for 12 hours. Isolated mouse islets were treated with the cytokine mix, and protein levels of Viperin measured by Western blotting.

**Results:**
Pro-inflammatory cytokines significantly enhanced Viperin mRNA in INS-1 cells over 6h (150-fold), 12h (90-fold) and 24h (50-fold) ( <0.0001). Moreover, protein levels of Viperin were enhanced at all time points (20-fold at 24h; <0.0001) in INS-1 cells and isolated mouse islets at 24h (10-fold; <0.01). Treatment with stressors including tunicamycin (ER stress), streptozotocin (oxida- tive stress) or palmitate (lipotoxic stress) failed to induce Viperin, indicating a specific response to cytokines. Human islets showed an 86-fold induction of Viperin mRNA by IFNα. Induction of Viperin expression by cytokines is inhibited by the anti-inflammatory JAK (Janus Kinase) inhibitor Baricitinib (1μmol) (Fig.1), or the tyros- ine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor Deucravacitinib (1μmol), in INS-1 cells ( <0.0001 & <0.01, respectively). Knockdown of Viperin in INS-1 cells significantly impaired the cytokine-induction of genes containing an antioxidant response element (ARE) ( <0.0001), along with basal NRF1 ( ; NFE2 Like BZIP Transcription Factor 1) protein levels, while NRF2 protein levels were unchanged, suggesting that Viperin promotes antioxidant gene expression via NRF1 Knockdown of Viperin protected INS-1 cells from cytokine- induced apoptosis ( <0.05), but reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ( <0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Viperin is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines in rat INS-1 cells, mouse islets and human islets, an effect which is blocked by JAK or TYK2 inhibition using the anti-inflammatory drugs Barici- tinib or Deucravacitinib. Knockdown experiments suggest inhibition of Viperin may confer beta cell protective effects, but at the expense of insulin secretory function.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), an autoim- mune disorder driven by genetic and environmental factors, is char- acterized by progressive destruction of insulin-producing β-cells. With over 2 million cases in China and rising global incidence, T1DM imposes a heavy societal burden due to lifelong insulin dependence, early-onset complications, and unclear pathogenesis. Emerging evi- dence links T1DM to gut dysbiosis, particularly reduced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, which may exacerbate auto- immunity via intestinal barrier disruption and immune dysregulation. Our prior clinical studies identified altered gut microbiota and SCFAs deficiency in T1DM patients, correlating with autoantibody levels. However, whether microbiota directly drives pancreatic immune injury remains unknown. This study investigates the mechanistic role of dys- biotic microbiota and metabolites in T1DM pathogenesis using multi- omics and humanized fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) models.

**Materials and methods:**
Clinical Cohort: We analyzed glycemic pro- files (HbA1c, FPG), immune markers (T-cell subsets, cytokines), gut microbiota (16S rRNA sequencing), and fecal metabolites in healthy controls (HC, n=21), autoantibody-positive (T1DP, n=22), and autoan- tibody-negative (T1DN, n=21) T1DM patients. Multi-omics integra- tion revealed microbiota-metabolite-immune crosstalk. FMT Mouse Models: Antibiotic-treated C57BL/6JGpt and NOD mice received FMT from HC, T1DP, or T1DN donors. Metabolic parameters (weight, FPG, OGTT, insulin secretion), intestinal permeability (FITC-Dextran, tight junction proteins), pancreatic histopathology (HE staining, islet quantification), T-cell infiltration (flow cytometry), and microbiota/ metabolite profiles (SCFAs) were assessed over 16 weeks. Multivariate analyses linked microbial taxa to immune phenotypes.

**Results:**
Clinical Findings: T1DM patients exhibited elevated HbA1c ( <0.05), impaired β-cell function ( FCP), Th1/Th17 skew- ing ( Th1/Th17, Treg/Th2), and reduced SCFAs-producing taxa (e.g., ). Fecal metabolites (branched-chain amino acids, long-chain fatty acids) were depleted, strongly correlating with T-cell imbalance. Animal Models: C57 mice showed no significant differences in fasting blood glucose, OGTT, or serum insulin concen- trations among three groupse. Fecal microbiota from the three human cohorts were successfully colonized in corresponding mouse groups. T1DP-FMT NOD mice showed hyperglycemia ( FPG, OGTT-AUC), insulin secretion, fewer islets ( <0.05), and increased lymphocytic infiltration. Intestinal barrier integrity was compromised ( ZO-1/ Occludin, <0.05). T1DP/T1DN-FMT mice displayed pancreatic CD4+ T and Treg cells, CTLA-4+ CD8+ T cells, and reduced fecal SCFAs (acetate, butyrate). Dominant taxa shifted to (T1DP) or (T1DN), with specific taxa-T-cell correla- tions ( <0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Dysbiotic microbiota cannot independently drive the pathogenesis of T1DM.Deficiency of SCFAs-producing bacteria and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may contribute to pancreatic immune injury in T1DM by inducing Treg cell-mediated immune tolerance imbalance and diminishing CD8+ T cell exhaustion.

**Modelling alpha cell dysfunction in type 1 diabetes with reaggre- gated primary human islet and proinsulin-specific cytotoxic T lym- phocyte co-cultures**

**Background and aims:**
The pancreatic α-cells play a crucial role in glucose homeostasis by secreting glucagon in response to low glucose levels, thereby preventing hypoglycaemia. In individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), this counterregulatory glucagon response is impaired, increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. The mechanisms underlying this dysfunction remain incompletely understood, partly due to the poor translatability of rodent models and the limited availability of human islets from individuals with T1D. To address this, we developed an T1D model of α-cell impairment in which the primary target of the autoimmune attack remains the β-cell, while α-cells are exposed to the inflammatory environment and resulting disruptions in α-β cell interactions. For this purpose, we co-cultured standardized reaggre- gated human islet microtissues (MTs) with cytotoxic ­CD8 T lympho- cytes (CTLs) that specifically target and kill pancreatic β-cells.

**Materials and methods:**
Islet MTs were generated through gentle dissociation, scaffold-free, high-throughput reaggregation of primary human islet cells. For T1D modelling, islet MTs were cultured for three days with CTLs that specifically recognize a preproinsulin (PPI) peptide presented on HLA-A2 molecules. At the end of the co-culture, α- and β-cell functions were assessed by sequential glucose-dependent hormone secretion assays at 2.8 and 16.7 mM glucose, followed by quantification of insulin and glucagon secretion. The cells were then lysed for the measurement of intracellular insulin, glucagon, and ATP contents. α- and β-cell death and survival, as well as T cell infiltration, were assessed by 3D microscopy using nuclear markers aristaless- related homeobox (ARX), NK6 homeobox 1 (NKX6.1), and cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), respectively.

**Results:**
As previously described, the CTL attack on the islet MTs led to increased basal and decreased glucose-stimulated insulin release, as well as reduced intracellular insulin content. 3D microscopic analy- sis revealed a significant decline in NKX6.1-positive cell count and fraction that correlated with the T cell count used for the co-culture. Interestingly, glucagon secretion from α-cells, particularly at 2.8 mM glucose, and glucagon content of the islet MTs were significantly reduced. 3D microscopic analysis further revealed a small loss of ARX-positive cells following co-culture with higher counts of T cells.

**Conclusion:**
Although β-cells were specifically targeted in this model, collateral damage to α-cells resulted in functional disruptions similar to those observed in individuals with T1D. The described biomimetic human islet-immune assays thus represent valuable tools for studying α-cell dysfunction and exploring potential therapeutic approaches at scale.

**Background and aims:**
Antiviral response and immune signaling is crucial in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity, pancreatic inflammation and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Genetic variants in the interferon induced helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1) which result in the reduction of the viral RNA sensor melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and regulates antiviral responses protect from T1D. IFIH1 expression is highly upregulated in β-cells in the T1D pancreas. The Hippo pathway with its downstream activator Yes-associated Protein (YAP) has shown dual roles in inhibiting as well as promoting antiviral responses, auto- immunity and pancreatitis. We hypothesized that its expression is regu- lated in response to coxsackievirus infection (CVB3 and CVB4) and is modulated by IFIH1 in the NOD mouse during diabetes progression.

**Materials and methods:**
Pancreatic tissue sections were obtained from 10-12-week-old male and female WT and NOD mice, which were IFIH1 heterozygous ­(IFIH1 ), IFIH1 knockout ­(IFIH1 ), or had an in-frame deletion within the ATPase site of the helicase 1 domain of MDA5 (ΔHel1). Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to assess pancreatic total YAP expression and the percentage of ­YAP / CD45 immune cells.

**Results:**
YAP expression was increased in hyperglycemic NOD mice compared to WT controls, this was seen throughout the whole pancreas and around islets and correlated with insulitis. CVB infection further significantly increased YAP expression in infected NOD mice (mean of 2.8-fold increase by CVB3 and CVB4, compared to uninfected NOD controls; <0.05). This was significantly prevented in ­IFIH1 , ­IFIH1 and in ΔHel1 NOD mice (mean of 2.4-fold reduction, com- pared to respective infected NOD WT controls; <0.05). In correlation with the expression of YAP, the severity of insulitis was markedly induced in CVB-infected mice and reduced in ­IFIH1 , ­IFIH1 and in ΔHel1 NOD mice, compared to wild-type NOD mice, where the pro- portion of islets with severe insulitis (score 3) was significantly lower, with a higher percentage of islets showing mild or no insulitis (scores 0-1). Thereafter, we analysed the number of ­YAP immune cells, which were mostly around the islets but also spread throughout the pancreas. This revealed that YAP was not only expressed in acinar cells, but 3.5% ­CD45 cells were also positive for YAP in NOD mice. The per- centage of ­YAP CD45 cells were significantly higher in CVB3 and CVB4-infected NOD mice (2.6- and 2.8-fold increase, respectively, compared to uninfected NOD controls; <0.05). In line with the total YAP expression in the pancreas, the number of ­YAP CD45 cells were reduced by a mean of 38% in CVB3 and CVB4 infected ­IFIH1 mice, compared to infected WT NOD mice ( <0.05).

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that YAP is hyperexpressed in the pancreas of NOD mice. IFIH1 regulates its expression in the whole pancreas as well as in areas of insulitis during CVB infection. YAP may therefore be an important target which influences pancreatitis, viral replication and immune responses in T1D.

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic beta cells initially synthesize insulin as the precursor protein proinsulin, which is subsequently processed into mature insulin by prohormone convertases PC1/3 and PC2, as well as carboxypeptidase E. Studies in individuals living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have demonstrated persistent secretion of proinsulin, indicating a potential impairment in its processing. We hypothesized that circulating proinsulin:C-peptide ratios increase prior to the onset of diabetes in NOD mice, while beta cell expression of Pc1/3 decreases.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate changes in circulating pro- insulin and C-peptide, blood samples were collected every 4 weeks from wildtype female and male NOD mice until diabetes onset or 30 weeks of age (n=14-15 per group). In a separate cohort, beta cell Pc1/3 levels were assessed by immunofluorescence in female non-diabetic NOD mice at 6, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age, and in male non-diabetic NOD mice at 6, 8, and 20 weeks of age (n=4 per sex at each age). Plasma proinsulin and C-peptide levels were quantified by ELISA in both cohorts.

**Results:**
Female NOD mice that developed diabetes exhibited a 1.73- fold increase in plasma proinsulin and 1.66-fold higher proinsulin:C- peptide ratio compared to non-diabetic mice, 7-10 weeks prior to dia- betes onset. Notably, this early increase in plasma proinsulin appears to serve as a predictor of diabetes development, with proinsulin levels significantly elevated at 8 weeks of age (p=0.004) in female NOD mice that developed diabetes before the study’s median age of onset. These changes were not observed in male NOD mice. In the second cohort, female non-diabetic NOD mice showed a 1.7-fold reduction in beta cell Pc1/3 immunofluorescence intensity between 6 and 16 weeks of age (p=0.04), while plasma proinsulin levels increased 16-fold (p=0.03). The proportion of Pc1/3 beta cells remained sta- ble in female NOD mice throughout this period. There were minimal changes in beta cell Pc1/3 levels and plasma proinsulin in male non- diabetic NOD mice.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that early increases in plasma proin- sulin and proinsulin:C-peptide ratio could serve as predictive biomark- ers for the development of T1D. Furthermore, elevations in plasma proinsulin and loss of beta cell Pc1/3 occur before diabetes onset in NOD mice. While the overall abundance of Pc1/3 decreases in beta cells with disease progression, the proportion of beta cells that express Pc1/3 remains stable. This suggests that elevated proinsulin levels arise from decreased Pc1/3 within individual beta cells, rather than a reduc- tion in the number of beta cells that express it.

**Beta cell stress triggers formation of hybrid insulin peptide through granular pH modulation**

T. Delong

**Background and aims:**
The Eisenbarth model of type 1 diabetes (T1D) describes a linear decline in pancreatic beta cells but fails to explain the variable disease progression in at-risk individuals. Hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) have emerged as potential disease triggers or major drivers of beta cell destruction. HIPs form when proinsulin pep- tides link to other beta cell protein fragments, creating peptides not expressed in the thymus. This allows HIP-reactive T cells to escape negative selection, potentially contributing to beta cell destruction in T1D. We investigated HIP formation by cathepsin D (CatD), a protease that creates disease-relevant HIPs in beta cells. While HIPs are con- sistently detectable in murine islets, their detection in human islets is sporadic. We hypothesized this difference is due to varying pH optima for CatD activity between species. Murine CatD forms HIPs below pH 6.0, while human CatD only forms HIPs at pH 5.0 or less. We proposed that treating human islets with stressors such as the cytokine IL-1beta, which has been shown to reduce lysosomal pH, could have the same effect in the insulin granule and activate HIP formation.

**Materials and methods:**
Human islets were treated with varying IL-1β concentrations (0-10pg/mL) or C381 (0-100 μM), a compound that boosts vATPase activity and was shown to lower lysosomal pH. Samples were then lysed, fractionated, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

**Results:**
We detected formation of a HIP (GAGSLQPL-TPIESHQV) in islets treated with 10pg/mL IL-1beta or 100 μM C381. The peptide’s identity was confirmed by comparison to a synthetic HIP, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.987 and a retention time deviation of 0.02 min.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that HIP formation occurs under specific stress conditions, such as in the presence of pro-inflamma- tory cytokines, which can decrease granular pH. These HIPs may then become targets for the adaptive immune system, mediating beta cell destruction in T1D. Thus, the diverse environmental exposures throughout a human’s lifetime could explain the highly variable disease progression observed. This research may provide a modification to the Eisenbarth model and offer new insights into T1D progression. Future studies will explore how stressors affect immune targeting of HIP-con- taining beta cells and whether this leads to gradual beta cell depletion.

**MiR-155 is upregulated in the pancreas in type 1 diabetes**

K. Maedler, J. Mistry, S. Geravandi

**Background and aims:**
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), vital regulators of gene expression, are important biomarkers and modulators of autoim- mune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Elevated serum levels of miR-155 and miR-146 are associated with T1D, where they control inflammatory pathways and immune cell activation, especially through modulating antiviral responses. Dysregulation of these miRNAs can disrupt immune tolerance, promoting chronic inflammation and con- tributing to T1D pathogenesis. A precise balance between miR-155 and miR-146 is essential for immune homeostasis: miR-155 drives immune activation, while miR-146 provides a counter-regulatory effect. Their imbalance may foster chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. This study analyzed miR-155 and miR-146 expression in human islets and in the whole pancreas.

**Materials and methods:**
A miRNA qPCR array (miRCURY LNA™, covering 753 miRNAs) was performed on human islets from four independent isolations infected with CVB4 (MOI of 5) for 24 hours, comparing infected to uninfected islets. Findings were validated by RT-PCR on islets and exosome-derived miRNAs. Exosomes from CVB-infected CM9 beta cells were isolated and transferred to human islets and monocytes derived from PBMCs, followed by apoptosis and inflammatory marker analysis. miRNA-scope was used to identify expression differences and localization in pancreas tissues from con- trols, Aab+ and T1D organ donors (nPOD cohort).

**Results:**
49 were downregulated and 19 upregulated following CVB3 infection. Notably, miR-155 and miR-146b showed 3.3-fold and 1.9- fold upregulation, respectively, in infected islets compared to con- trols. In CVB4-infected islets, miR-155 and miR-146b expression in exosomes increased 5- and 8-fold, though expression in whole islet lysates remained unchanged. Visualization by the View-RNA Cell Plus Assay confirmed miR-155 and miR-146b expression in infected islets. Exosome transfer from infected beta cells to islets or monocytes influenced enterovirus-induced beta cell death and inflammation, with marked induction of interferon response mark- ers (e.g., IFNβ, CXCL10). Further analysis indicated potential viral contamination in exosomal fractions, suggesting exosomal effects may partly derive from residual enteroviral particles during isola- tion. Previous studies have mainly focused on circulating miRNAs as biomarkers in T1D, while studying miRNA expression within pancreatic tissues posed challenges due to miRNAs’ short length. Here, we successfully optimized a method combining immunohis- tochemistry and in situ hybridization (miRNAscope™) to detect miR-146b and miR-155 alongside insulin in FFPE pancreatic tissues from non-diabetic, T1D-associated autoantibody positive (Aab+), and T1D donors. Quantification and spatial analysis showed signifi- cantly elevated miR-155 expression in the exocrine pancreas of T1D and Aab+ donors (pre-T1D progression) compared to non-diabetic controls, whereas miR-146b levels remained unchanged across both exocrine and endocrine regions.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the importance of examining com- plex miRNA dynamics within the pancreas in T1D. The upregulation of miR-155, together with unchanged miR-146b levels, points to dys- regulation in inflammatory signaling pathways, potentially amplifying pancreatic inflammation and autoimmunity in T1D. Correcting this imbalance may offer a therapeutic approach to mitigate immune-medi- ated beta cell damage in T1D.

**Pancreatic YAP expression induces classical beta cell dedifferentia- tion pathways**

A. Kruf

**Background and aims:**
Enteroviral infections have been associated with an increased risk of developing islet autoimmunity and Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Our previous research has shown that YAP levels are elevated in T1D and Aab+ donor pancreatic tissue compared to non- diabetic control tissues. The same study has demonstrated that YAP upregulation occurs in CVB infections in both the endocrine and exo- crine pancreas, where it promotes inflammation and viral replication. This aberrant upregulation of YAP is not limited to T1D but is also observed in other pancreatic disorders such as pancreatic ductal adeno- carcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatitis. The common upregulation of YAP in T1D, pancreatitis and PDAC suggests that it may play a central role in the pathogenesis of pancreatic disorders. This study aims to eluci- date the relationship between YAP-mediated inflammation, subsequent cell dedifferentiation, and the switch towards a progenitor-like state in enteroviral and viral-like infections of human islets.

**Materials and methods:**
Human pancreatic islets and endocrine-exo- crine co-cultures from organ donors were exposed to enteroviral CVB3 and 4 infections and various pro-inflammatory conditions and YAP, CTGF and Sox9 protein and RNA levels analyzed by western blotting, immunocytochemistry (ICC), qPCR and RNAscope.

**Results:**
YAP and its downstream target CTGF were highly and signifi- cantly increased in CVB-infected human islets and human endocrine- exocrine co-cultures at RNA and protein levels (from 0% to a mean of 2.3% ­CTGF cells within islets; n=3, p<0.05). In addition to CVB infec- tion-induced upregulation of YAP and YAP’s classical target CTGF, we also observed the induction of SOX9 expression by YAP-overexpression, CVB4 infection and under pro-viral conditions of polyI:C transfection and IFNα treatment in human islets and in the INS-1 beta-cell line, sug- gesting that YAP might be involved in the regulation of SOX9 expres- sion, dedifferentiation and impaired insulin secretion.

**Conclusion:**
Increased expression of YAP, CTGF and the transcription factor SOX9 in response to inflammation and viral infection in beta cells indicate that YAP not only exacerbates inflammation but also promotes beta-cell dedifferentiation into a progenitor-like state. YAP may play a central role in pancreatic dysfunction in T1D and other pancreatic diseases by driving both inflammation and cellular plasticity.

**Background and aims:**
Mutations in are a well-established cause of monogenic diabetes, typically inherited dominantly. How- ever, a patient carrying a recessive p.A251T variant responded to insulin therapy after initial misclassification. This case suggested an alternative inheritance mechanism, prompting investigation of the functional impact of p.A251T in β-cells. Using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and CRISPR-engineered SC-β cell models, we aimed to determine how this variant affects β-cell func- tion and insulin secretion.

**Materials and methods:**
Functional in vitro assays DNA binding, and transactivation activity were performed using standard techniques. Patient fibroblasts were reprogrammed using OCT4, SOX2, C-MYC, and KLF4 plasmids. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was performed using Alt-R CRISPR HDR technology to introduce the p. A251T mutation and create hemizygous and null cell lines, confirmed by Sanger sequencing and Western blotting. Human stem cells were differentiated into β-like cells over 27 days. Insulin secre- tion was measured using a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay. Ca² dynamics were monitored using Cal-590 and spinning-disc microscopy. Immunofluorescence assessed β-cell markers, insulin, and glucagon-positive cells. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0.

**Results:**
DNA binding activity (~50%; n=9; p=0.1) and transacti- vation (~10%; n=27, p=0.1) tended to be reduced in the p. A251T variant compared to wild-type protein. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was decreased in iPSC-derived SC-β A251T cells compared to healthy donor-derived SC-β cells (16.7 vs 3.3 mM, n=9, p=0.0003). When exposed to high glucose and the GLP-1 receptor agonist Exendin-4, or Glibenclamide (GLB), A251T cells exhibited higher insulin secretion compared to high glucose alone (Exendin-4: 0.1% vs 0.3% total, GLB: 0.2% vs 0.3%; both p < 0.001). A higher pro- portion of glucagon-positive cells in A251T SC-β cells (19.4% ± 2.2%) compared to controls (13.6% ± 1.4%, n=9; p=0.04) suggested a shift towards an α-cell fate. In iPSC-derived recessive A251T variant cells, glucose-induced Ca² responses tended to be lower (n=15; p=0.3). In genome-edited SC-derived hESCs, at 16.7 mM glucose, MEL-1 (WT ; +/+) cells secreted 37.3% total insulin/30 min., hemizy- gous null (+/−) cells secreted 25.0%, and A251T (A251T/−) cells secreted 17.0%. null (−/−) cells secreted 10.8%. Glu- cose (16.7 vs 3 mM) prompted Ca² increases in (+/-; n=3, p=0.006) but not in A251T hemizygous cells (n=3, p=0.04).

**Conclusion:**
We provide a detailed analysis of a recessive vari- ant associated with monogenic diabetes. Our data are consistent with the view that that the A251T variant leads to mild loss of function, leading to impaired Ca² dynamics, and consistent with the observa- tion of diabetes only in homozygous carriers. Importantly, defective glucose-induced insulin secretion from patient-derived SC-β cells was partially rescued with exendin-4, suggesting that GLP-1R agonists may be useful therapeutically.

**Targeting to turn human alpha cells into insulin producers**

C. Renaud

**Background and aims:**
The reprogramming of α-cells into insulin production is a promising approach to treat diabetes. We have shown that human α-cells can secrete insulin in response to glucose by forcing the expression of and (PM). Although converted α-cells retained the α-cell transcriptomic signature, they restored euglycemia when transplanted into diabetic mice. We hypothesize that silencing the transcription factor key for α-cell identity maintenance, will foster the reprogramming of human α-cells by reducing their α-cell profile.

**Materials and methods:**
We have generated five Cas9-medi- ated homozygous knock-out subclones using mouse αTC1.9 cells. We have also optimized a protocol for the Cas9-mediated deletion of in isolated purified primary human α-cells. The impact of loss was assessed at functional and transcriptomic levels.

**Results:**
In murine α-cells (αTC1.9 cell line), loss led to reduced glucagon secretion at low glucose. Bulk RNA-sequencing revealed that the functional phenotype was associated with decreased α-cell identity and changes in secretion-associated processes. In human α-cells, loss decreased their α-cell identity and promoted the acquisition of β-cell identity traits, such as the expression of the β-cell genes and .

**Conclusion:**
These preliminary observations suggest that decreasing α-cell identity fosters α-cell plasticity and facilitates the PM-driven conversion of human α-cells.

**Background and aims:**
Monogenic diabetes accounts for 1-5% of dia- betes cases and is associated with pathogenic variants that frequently disrupt endocrine pancreas development and/or mature β-cell func- tion. Some underexplored genes, putatively linked to monogenic dia- betes, could unveil novel pathogenic mechanisms. encodes the moonlighting protein pterin-4α-carbinolamine dehydratase, which is involved in tetrahydrobiopterin recycling and also functions as a cofac- tor for HNF1A/HNF1B. Recessive pathogenic variants in have been identified in patients with an HNF1A-MODY-like phenotype; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesize that loss-of-function variants disrupt HNF1A/HNF1B activity, impair pancreatic endocrine differentiation, and contribute to mono- genic diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We generated CRISPR/Cas9-edited human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) carrying clinically relevant var- iants to mimic patient genotypes. These hPSCs were differentiated into pancreatic progenitors, endocrine progenitors, and β-like cells using stepwise differentiation protocols. We evaluated differentiation efficiency and β-cell marker expression through transcriptomic analysis and immunostaining, while glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assays assessed functional outcomes.

**Results:**
-mutant hPSCs exhibited a significant reduction in key endocrine transcription factors during the pancreatic progenitor stage compared with isogenic controls. Transcriptomic profiling revealed downregulation of HNF1A/HNF1B target genes, indicating disruption of their regulatory network. Furthermore, islet-like organoids at the β-like cell stage showed a reduced number of insulin- and glucagon- expressing cells, suggesting that PCBD1 loss-of-function impairs endo- crine pancreas development.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrate that PCBD1 is critical for proper endocrine pancreas development, likely through its interaction with HNF1A/HNF1B. Ongoing studies are further elucidating its role in HNF1A/HNF1B-mediated gene regulation. These results support the involvement of PCBD1 in monogenic diabetes pathogenesis and may inform future precision medicine approaches.

**Re-evaluating KLF11 in human endocrine pancreas development: implications for monogenic diabetes pathogenesis**

1. IIBm Sols-Morreale (CSIC/UAM), Madrid, Spain, CIBER de Diabe-

**Background and aims:**
Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is driven by mutations specific genes. MODY7, in particu- lar, has been associated with variants in , a transcription factor whose role in diabetes pathogenesis remains still unclear. Some studies have questioned its candidacy as a monogenic diabetes driver due the relatively high prevalence of these variants in the general population. Moreover, previous animal model studies have yielded inconclusive results regarding the role of KLF11 in the endocrine pancreas, high- lighting the need for research in a human context. This study aims to elucidate the function of KLF11 during human endocrine pancreas development and in mature β-cell function, to clarify its contribution to MODY.

**Materials and methods:**
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) were used in differentiation protocols to model human endocrine pancreas development. We generated loss-of-function hPSC lines, as well as lines carrying single-nucleotide variants identified in MODY7 patients, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Endocrine differentia- tion efficiency, transcriptional profiles, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were assessed to determine the impact of KLF11 alterations.

**Results:**
Comparative analyses between -edited lines and isoge- neic controls revealed no significant differences in endocrine differen- tiation. No significant differences were observed across endocrine dif- ferentiation between -deficient and control lines. Transcriptional profiling and functional assays demonstrated that disruption did not impair the formation of insulin-producing cells or their capacity for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings indicate that is not a key regulator of endocrine pancreatic development nor essential for the formation of functional β-cells. These results support current recommendations to exclude as a primary causative gene for monogenic diabetes. However, the potential for to interact with other genetic fac- tors in an oligogenic form of diabetes cannot be completely ruled out.

**Background and aims:**
Glucokinase (GCK) catalyzes the phospho- rylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate during the glycolytic path- way in pancreatic β-cells. This reaction represents the rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism, enabling them to respond to variations in blood glucose levels. Mutations in the gene can lead to either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. A heterozygous loss-of-function mutation is responsible for maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY2), whereas a homozygous inactivating mutation results in permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). The mechanisms by which mutations contribute to the development of diabetes are not yet fully understood, due to the absence of human models. This study seeks to investigate the impact of mutations on pancreatic β-cells, by uncovering the molecular mechanisms linked to the defects associ- ated with mutations through the utilization of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models.

**Materials and methods:**
In the current study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the blood cells of two patients diagnosed with heterozygous and homozygous L146P mutations in the gene. The presence of these mutations in the patients’ samples was confirmed through whole exome sequencing (WES), followed by Sanger sequencing. We established three iPSC lines from each patient and extensively characterized them using various approaches. To evalu- ate the effects of the mutations, we examined the folding ability, ther- mal stability, and equilibrium binding capacity of GCK. Additionally, an in-silico study was performed to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of the GCK protein and to predict the impact of the GCK mutation. A CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in approach was employed to cor- rect the mutation, thereby generating isogenic controls. Furthermore, a CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out approach was used to create knockout models, which aid in understanding the role of GCK in insulin secretion from beta cells. All generated iPSCs were differentiated into pancreatic line- ages to investigate the effects of GCK mutations on the development diabetes.

**Results:**
Our findings indicate that the generated iPSC lines exhibit pluripotency characteristics, differentiate spontaneously into the three germ layers, and display normal karyotypes. All generated models were confirmed through Sanger sequencing. The analysis of the thermal sta- bility and folding ability of GCK suggests that the mutated GCK pro- tein is less stable compared to the wild type (WT) controls, despite both proteins being correctly folded. Furthermore, the equilibrium binding assessment indicates that the mutated GCK protein exhibits a greater binding capacity and affinity for glucose. Furthermore, in silico analy- sis indicates that this GCK mutation may influence its binding affinity with the glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). All generated iPSCs, along with their isogenic controls and knockout models, were success- fully differentiated into pancreatic β-cells. Additional functional studies were conducted on these cells to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the defects associated with mutations.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, these human iPSC models may offer signif- icant insights into the fundamental mechanisms of monogenic diabetes, paving the way for personalized treatment approaches.

**EPDR1, an obesity-induced protein, support autophagy and func- tional maturation of beta cells**

F. Munoz

**Background and aims:**
Ependymin-related protein 1 (EPDR1) was first identified as a batokine, but we recently reported that EPDR1 is also expressed in human pancreatic β-cells. EPDR1 expression is elevated in islets from obese and type 2 diabetic (T2D) donors, correlating with donor BMI. Additionally, we showed that EPDR1 is required for proper mitochondrial metabolism and glucose stimu- lated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, whether it has a role in β-cell differentiation and adaptation to metabolic stress remains unknown. Autophagy and mitophagy are key cleaning and recycling mechanisms for maintaining cellular and mitochondrial homeostasis under metabolic stress and along β-cell differentiation. We propose that EPDR1 expression is induced both during the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into β-like cells and in response to metabolic stress. In both cases, EPDR1 upregulation facilitates autophagy and mitophagy, promoting β-cell maturation or preserv- ing β-cell function.

**Materials and methods:**
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and the pluripotent stem cell line HUES4 were treated with human recombinant EPDR1 protein (hEPDR1, 2.5 μg/mL) during the last 17 days of the differentiation protocol to generate human β-like cells. RNA-seq and pathway enrichment analysis were performed in KD INS1 832/13 cells. Autophagy flux and autophagy/ mitophagy-related proteins were assessed by immunoblot. For GSIS assays, Insulin quantified by ELISAs. Gene expression analyzed via qPCR.

**Results:**
EPDR1 levels increased at the end of β-cell differentia- tion in both hiPSCs and HUES4 cells, and treatment with hEPDR1 improved differentiation outcomes. EPDR1 expression was also upregulated in response to chronic metabolic stress induced by elevated palmitate 500uM in INS1 832/13 cells (+30%, ). RNA-seq analysis revealed autophagy as one of the significantly altered pathways in KD cells. Interestingly, EPDR1 expres- sion was consistently responsive to autophagy flux as it increases in response to autophagy-inducing conditions (Rapamycin (+25%), serum deprivation (+10%)) and decreases in response to autophagy- blocking conditions (chloroquine (-37%, )). This pattern was observed at both mRNA and protein levels in INS1 832/13 and EndoC-βH1 β-cell lines. Silencing β-cells resulted in reduced autophagic flux (-42%, ) and basal p62 levels (-40%, ) whereas in an increase of mitochondrial complex subunits and PINK1(+96%, ) suggesting an accumulation of mitochon- dria tagged for degradation but not efficiently cleared. -KD cells also displayed elevated expressions of early autophagy media- tors ( ) (+78%, ), suggesting an attempt to compensate for impaired autophagy. Autophagy induction in -KD cells rescued insulin production and partially restored GSIS (+33%, ).

**Conclusion:**
In line with its upregulation in human islets with obesity, EPDR1 levels rise in response to metabolic stress. This includes its upregulation during the differentiation of human pluripotent cells into β-like cells and under lipotoxic conditions. EPDR1 expression is regu- lated by autophagy to support efficient autophagy flux in β-cells. EPDR1 treatment may support autophagy to help β cells cope with metabolic stress during differentiation and obesity-related energy-overload to pre- serve or improve their functional maturation. The above-mentioned find- ings support EPDR1 as a promising target in diabetes research.

**Roles of zinc depletion in the protective effects of SLC30A8 vari- ants in human beta-like cells**

3. sity, New York, NY, USA, Imperial College London, London, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) affects over 10% of the worldwide population, with genetic predisposition playing an key role in T2D risk. Loss of function variants of the gene, encoding the zinc transporter ZnT8 located in the insulin granule of the pancreatic beta cells, are associated with protective effects against zinc depletion, a condition also associated with T2D development. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which protection is conferred are unclear. Previous studies have indicated that inactivating variants increase cytosolic zinc levels (Firth et al, , 2023). The present study therefore sought to determine whether forced changes in intracellular ­Zn in human pancreatic beta-like cells, imposed using the zinc chelator Tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), affect cell survival and function. The interaction with a protective inac- tivating allele of was also explored.

**Materials and methods:**
Unmodified INS(GFP/w) human embry- onic stem cells (MEL1) or a CRISPR/Cas9 engineered subline bearing the loss of function R138X variant were differ- entiated into pancreatic beta-like cells. Treatment for 48 h with TPEN (1 μM) was used to deplete intracellular zinc. mRNA and protein levels were assessed by RT-qPCR and immunostaining respectively and apoptosis using TUNEL assay. Glucose-stimulated intracellular ­Ca dynamics were also evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using the calcium probe Cal590, and rapid spinning disc microscopy (Zeiss AxioObserver, Z1). Statistical comparisons were made using student t-test and one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test (GraphPad Prism). Results are from three independent differentiations.

**Results:**
Zinc depletion of wild type beta-like cells with TPEN treatment induced apoptosis, as evidenced by TUNEL staining (p=0.007). Immunostaining revealed that the treatment led to a significant reduction in apparent insulin protein (p=0.009), but no change in insulin mRNA levels. NKX6.1 mRNA levels were decreased (p=0.04) though protein levels were unaltered. Somato- statin gene expression was also lowered (p=0.01). Finally, immunoreactivity showed a strong tendency to decrease after TPEN treatment (p=0.06). The above changes were associated with increased glucose-induced ­Ca dynamics (differences between areas under the curves, AUC; p=0.03 at 11 mM glucose; p=0.002 at 17 mM glucose ) and increased oscillation frequency (p=0.018 at 11 mM; p=0.048 at 17 mM). In the absence of TPEN, R138X cells demonstrated a significant decrease of ­Ca dynamics versus com- mon variant (R138R) cells (p = 0.025 at 17 mM). Interestingly, the protective effects of TPEN were exaggerated in R138X cells versus variant controls (AUC for ­Ca dynamics: p = 0.0076 at 11 mM; p = 0.0004 at 17 mM; oscillation frequency: p=0.0008 at 11 mM; p=0.001 at 17 mM).

**Conclusion:**
These findings demonstrate that depletion of intracel- lular zinc impairs human beta cell identity and function. Our results are consistent with earlier observations demonstrating that inac- tivating variants of , which are protective against T2D, display increased cytosolic ­Zn levels, likely reflecting impaired ­Zn uptake into the secretory granule (Sui et al, , 2023). Low- ered ­Zn levels in common variant carriers are thus likely to promote relatively poorer beta cell survival and function versus carriers of inactivating variants.

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic islets play a central role in nutrient regulation and diabetes. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived β-like cells (iPSC-β) offer promising therapeutic potential and tools for diabetes modelling. Efficient and standardized functional quality controls are needed. We used non-invasive and high-resolution Micro- Electrode Array (MEA)-chips to characterize iPSC-β and evaluate, in a proof-of-concept study, the functional impact of a neonatal diabetes genetic variant in a gene encoding an endoplasmic reticulum protein.

**Materials and methods:**
The iPSC lines 1.023 and Hel115.6 were differentiated into iPSC-β aggregates using a 7-stage protocol. 1.023 iPSC were CRISPR/Cas9-edited to introduce a rare neonatal diabetes- causing mutation. iPSC-β were cultured on-chip in 2D clusters or 3D pseudo-islets, in order to record: (i) single-cell action potentials (APs), and (ii) multicellular and β cell-specific slow potentials (SPs) whose frequency indicates global β cell activity and amplitude reflects β cell coupling.

**Results:**
iPSC-β were sequentially exposed to low and high glucose (2.8 and 16.7 mM), an amino acid mix, and forskolin to mimic incretin stimulation. Comparisons between electrical activity measured on-chip and classical dynamic insulin secretion assay showed that MEA-chips discriminated well between preparations with low (<2) and high (>5) glucose-stimulated insulin secretion index. 1.023 and Hel115.6 iPSC-β generated APs and SPs, indicating that iPSC-β are electrically coupled, similarly to primary human β cells. 1.023 iPSC-β cells were more elec- trically active than Hel115.6 iPSC-β (70 vs 30% of clusters, respec- tively) and had a higher degree of coupling (SP amplitudes: 32.06±6.54 vs 8.62±1.96 μV, respectively). Electrical responses to high glucose were moderate (SP frequency: 0.23±0.02 vs 0.17±0.09 Hz, respec- tively), but they were strongly increased by 16.7 mM glucose and a physiological amino acids mix (0.33±0.27 and 0.24±0.09 Hz) and for- skolin (0.41±0.02 and 0.31±0.09 Hz). Compared to control cells, the neonatal diabetes variant reduced glucose + amino acids stimulated β cell activity (0.27±0.06 and 0.17±0,025 Hz, respectively; p<0.0001; N=4-5 differentiations, n=165-121 clusters). The variant consider- ably decreased β cell coupling (maximal SP amplitude: 21.36±6.98 to 8.53±0.79 μV; p<0.0001). To further standardize the functional quality control, 3D pseudo-islets from Hel115.6 iPSC-β were gener- ated (Φ 95±13 μm). The proportion of electrically active pseudo-islets was higher than that of aggregates (50 vs 25%). Finally, introducing microfluidics into MEA-chip recordings reduced β cell electrical activ- ity at low glucose and considerably increased the stimulatory index induced by high glucose + amino acids (from 1.5 to 37) and forskolin (from 2 to 76.7).

**Conclusion:**
Our dynamic islet-on-chip assay provides efficient iPSC-β functional quality control. It enables to study the impact of genetic vari- ants on human β cell function. In combination with microfluidics, the approach may allow in depth functional analysis and pharmacological screening for therapy.

**Transitioning from 2D to 3D culture enhances differentiation and functionality of iPSC-derived hepatocytes: a better model for liver disease**

S.S. Ghanem

**Background and aims:**
Liver diseases can be studied through better understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver devel- opment and pathogenesis. Despite the valuable clinical insights from traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell lines and murine models, it has still been a challenging task in recapitulating the complex three-dimen- sional (3D) organization of liver. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived hepatic organoids can be used to better model a vari- ety of human liver diseases. In this project, we study hepatic phenotype and metabolism by two distinct approaches, 2D and 3D human iPSC derived hepatocytes.

**Materials and methods:**
A differentiation protocol of human iPSCs was used to generate two different hepatic culture systems, 2D and 3D models. The differentiation outcome of 3D hepatic organoids was used for comparison with 2D cultures. The evaluation was based on spe- cific mRNA expression, protein levels, metabolic activity and hepatic functional assays.

**Results:**
Comparing 2D versus 3D differentiation systems using the same protocol showed significant alterations in the expression of key developmental and functional genes in iPSC-derived mature hepato- cytes (MH). These changes include an increase in the expression of ALB, APOA2, CPS1, and AAT, while genes associated with hepatic progenitors, such as FOXA2, were reduced in MH derived from 3D cultures compared to 2D. Hepatic functional assessments displayed higher levels of urea and glycogen, and lower glucose-6-phosphate in hepatic organoids compared to 2D cultures. This suggests better matu- ration and enhanced liver specific functionality of hepatic organoids compared to 2D culture model.

**Conclusion:**
3D hepatic organoids mark a major breakthrough in liver research and disease modeling. This model provides a more accurate and precise alternative to 2D cultures and animal models, resulting in deeper understanding of liver biology with future promising therapeutic approaches.

4. Italy, V Buzzi Children’s Hospital, Milan, Italy, Dompé Farmaceutici

**Background and aims:**
The IL-8/CXCR1-CXCR2 axis has been dem- onstrated to be impaired in type 1 diabetes (T1D), thus we hypothesize that targeting IL-8/CXCR1-CXCR2 axis may contribute to the expan- sion and differentiation of regulatory B cells (Bregs).

**Materials and methods:**
We profiled by FACS analysis murine and human Bregs (CD19+IL-10+ cells) isolated from patients with T1D as compared to healthy controls (HC) for IL-8/CXCR1-CXCR2 expression under resting/stimulating conditions. We tested the effect of murine Bregs expanded by LPS/rIL-2 in the presence of different titrations of Reparixin (1nM, 10nM and 50nM) in a co-culture assay with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated T cells or with diabetogenic T cells (BDC2.5 stimulated CD4+ T cells), during a proliferation assay.

**Results:**
Our data showed that IL-8 and CXCR2 were found signifi- cantly higher on Bregs and also on non-Bregs (CD19+IL-10- cells) in patients with T1D as compared to HC (p<0.05). While under stimulating conditions (anti-CD40L/LPS), CXCR1 and CXCR2 were found significantly higher on Bregs from patients with T1D as compared to HC (p<0.05). The murine data in NOD mice on Bregs generated under stimulating conditions (LPS/rIL-2) revealed an upregulation of CXCL1 and CXCR1 during the time course of T1D as hyperglycemic NOD mice showed the highest expression while those naturally protected from T1D showed the lowest expres- sion (p<0.05). We next studied the effect of targeting IL-8/CXCR1- CXCR2 during murine Bregs generation. A significant suppression of CD4+/CD8+ T cells effector proliferation in all conditions where Bregs were added as compared to T cells alone (p<0.001). Particu- larly, a reduced T cells response toward islet autoantigens with Bregs expanded in the presence of Reparixin 10nM showed the most potent effect as compared to untreated (p<0.001). Lastly, we confirmed the immunoregulatory capacities of Bregs generated using Reparixin through an inhibition of IFNγ production by diabetogenic T cells (p<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Altogether, targeting IL-8/CXCR1-CXCR2 axis may help to establish a novel tailored Bregs-based immunotherapy in T1D.

**Background and aims:**
Antigen-specific immune tolerance therapy holds promise as a curative approach to restore tolerance to beta-cell autoantigens and halt autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We developed a tolerogenic lipid nanoparticle (tLNP) platform that co- delivers immunomodulators and mRNA-encoded beta-cell autoantigens to induce durable immune tolerance. This study evaluated the efficacy of tLNPs in preventing and reversing diabetes in female NOD mice by attenuating beta-cell autoimmunity.

**Materials and methods:**
To assess whether tLNPs prevent diabetes, we injected female NOD mice every 14 days from 5 to 15 weeks with tLNPs, control LNPs (antigen-only or irrelevant antigen with/without immunomodulators), or buffer, and monitored blood glucose up to 30 weeks of age (diabetes onset defined as two readings > 20 mM). We compared efficacy of tLNP administration routes in the NOD diabetes prevention model and performed immune profiling in blood and spleens by flow cytometry. To test reversal of new-onset diabetes, tLNPs were administered after 2 consecutive blood glucose readings >11 mM, with monitoring twice weekly up to 22 weeks post-onset (diabetes progres- sion defined as 2 consecutive readings > 15 mM).

**Results:**
NOD mice treated with tLNPs had significantly reduced dia- betes incidence vs. buffer-injected controls (p=0.002, n=15/group). Protection was antigen-dependent, as irrelevant antigen with immu- nomodulators in LNPs was ineffective, similar to buffer control. Like- wise, antigen-only LNPs were not protective. Intramuscular (IM) was the most effective route of administration, with 3x IM injections con- ferring 100% protection to 30 weeks (p=0.0106 vs. untreated, n=6-7/ group). IM tLNP injection expanded polyclonal and antigen-specific regulatory T cells in circulation and increased dysfunction markers in CD4+ and CD8+ T effector cells. Remarkably, tLNPs reversed new- onset diabetes in 100% of mice, with treated mice remaining euglyce- mic without supplemental insulin for a median of 87 days (p=0.0067 vs. buffer, n=4/group). Notably, mice that received dual anti-CD3 and tLNP therapy were euglycemic at least 160 days following disease onset compared to a median of 9 weeks with anti-CD3 therapy alone (p=0.0158 vs. anti-CD3 only, n=5-6/group).

**Conclusion:**
Co-delivery of mRNA-encoded T1D autoantigens and immunomodulators using tLNPs effectively prevents and reverses auto- immune diabetes in NOD mice, by a mechanism involving regulatory T cell expansion and induction of T effector-cell dysfunction.

**Exploring an islet-protective role for native human pancreatic mes- enchymal stromal cells in health and in type 1 diabetes**

R.E. Dewhurst-Trigg, Richardson, C.L. Rackham

**Background and aims:**
Culture-expanded mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) reduce immune cell activation and improve islet functional survival. However, little is known about native human pancreatic MSCs (npMSCs) in health or how they are altered in type 1 diabetes. Here, we determined the number, density and islet-protective phenotype of npMSCs in situ in control individuals and those with type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Multiplex immunohistochemistry was used to identify npMSCs (CD90+/CD105+/CD73+/CD31-/CD45-/CD34-) in human pancreas sections from 38 donors (Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes and Exeter Archival Diabetes Biobank). Donors were categorised as either < 13 years at type 1 diabetes diagno- sis ( = 8) or ≥ 13 years at type 1 diabetes diagnosis ( = 11) or were age- and sex-matched individuals without diabetes. Consecutive sec- tions were immunostained with antisera against insulin, glucagon, and the established islet-protective and immunomodulatory factors Annexin A1 (ANXA1) and indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase-1. Whole-slide scans were acquired and npMSCs either inside or at the periphery (within 10 μm) of islets were quantified on an individual-islet basis. We identified 53,375 npMSCs and performed an analysis of 26,376 individual islets. Culture-expanded MSCs were exposed to cytokines and viability and proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry.

**Results:**
npMSC were identified in situ in the human pancreas where they wrap around the islet periphery in an expected spindle-like mor- phology. ANXA1 was expressed by 33.2% of npMSCs and this pro- portion did not differ among individuals with or without diabetes. The density of both intraislet npMSCs and npMSCs within 10 μm of the islet periphery was increased among insulin-containing islets in indi- viduals with type 1 diabetes compared to individuals without diabetes ( < 0.001). npMSC density within 10 μm of the islet periphery was preferentially increased in individuals ≥ 13 years at type 1 diabetes diagnosis compared to children < 13 years at diagnosis ( < 0.001). In type 1 diabetes, npMSC density was reduced around insulin-deficient islets compared to insulin-containing islets ( < 0.001), consistent with an islet-protective role for npMSCs. Exposure of culture-expanded MSCs to a proinflammatory cytokine combination led to their reduced proliferation and loss of viability.

**Conclusion:**
npMSCs express ANXA1 constitutively suggesting an islet-protective role in health. The density of npMSCs was increased around insulin-containing islets and lost around insulin-deficient islets in individuals with type 1 diabetes which aligns with this hypothesis. npMSC density at the periphery of insulin-containing islets was prefer- entially higher in individuals with later onset type 1 diabetes, correlat- ing with a less intense immune cell infiltration. The reduced ability of npMSCs to survive in the more intense pro-inflammatory environment around islets in younger onset type 1 diabetes may contribute to the rapid rate of beta cell loss in these individuals.

**Background and aims:**
The Transmembrane Protein 219 (TMEM219) signaling is a novel death receptor on β-cells that is activated in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Therefore, TMEM219 targeting may serve as a thera- peutic option in diabetes to prevent β-cell loss. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the anti-TMEM219 monoclonal human IgG4 antibody (mAb) Ebrasodebart to block the TMEM219 signaling and in preventing T1D onset in the non-obese diabetic (NOD).

**Materials and methods:**
In vitro: Apoptosis of the human β-cell were evaluated after culture with/without recombinant human IGFBP3 or pooled T1D serum and with/without Ebrasodebart. In vivo: Ebrasode- bart ability to prevent T1D onset was tested in NOD mice and NOD SCID animals, a more stringent model of disease. Immunophenotype and autoimmune response were evaluated as well as insulitis score.

**Results:**
In vitro: Ebrasodebart treatment significantly reduced apopto- sis in human β-cells and in pancreatic islets in the presence of IGFBP3 or of pooled T1D serum. In vivo: Ebrasodebart treatment resulted in significant prevention of diabetes onset in 10 weeks old NOD mice with 90% of animals free from diabetes at 24 weeks of age as compared to untreated controls. While no change was evident in the immunopheno- type at flow cytometry, the autoimmune response analyzed by rechallenging splenocytes with the CD4 and CD8 restricted islet peptides was significantly reduced. Moreover, the insulitis score was also normalized in treated animals as compared to untreated controls. Finally, in a more stringent model, 75% of NOD SCID mice injected with splenocytes obtained from normoglycemic Ebrasodebart-treated NOD mice did not develop diabetes while NOD SCID animals receiv- ing splenocytes from hyperglycemic NOD mice progressed to overt hyperglycemia.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings indicate that direct inhibition of TMEM219 signaling, which is dysregulated in T1D, preserved the beta cell mass and may thus represent a novel therapeutic opportunity for patients with T1D.

**Targeting of the AGE-RAGE axis during prediabetes can restore glucose homeostasis and induce changes to immune phenotype that reduce type 1 diabetes incidence in preclinical models**

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic disease with no cure and rising global incidence that cannot be explained solely by genetic predisposition. Environmental triggers such as increased consumption of ultra-processed foods, may contribute to increases in the body’s burden of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Increases in AGEs such as carboxymethyl lysine (CML) and glycated haemoglobin and the receptor of AGEs (RAGE), are known to associate with T1DM onset and induce inflammation, β-cell dysfunc- tion and insulin resistance. In the present study we explored reducing dietary AGEs and combination therapy with oral RAGE antagonist (oRA) to understand the impact of targeting the AGE-RAGE axis dur- ing prediabetes and offer an alternative therapeutic approach for T1DM prevention.

**Materials and methods:**
Female non-obese diabetic mice (NOD) were fed with either low AGE (LAGE) diet, or high AGE (HAGE, 5 fold higher CML content) diet from day 50 and followed until day 75 (pre- diabetes, n=10-20) where insulin tolerance by intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (i.p.ITT), and pancreatic immune cell infiltrates (insulitis) were assessed, or until day 200 of life to determine diabetes incidence (n=29-34). In a short-term immunological study, NOD mice were fed with HAGE diet from day 35 of age until day 75, ± oRA (daily from day 50, then 3x/week; n=8-12). Immunophenotype was assessed in blood (BLD), spleen (SPL), pancreatic (PLN) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) at the end of treatment using a 34 high-parameter flow cytometry panel. Additionally, immune cells from these mice were transferred into immunodeficient NOD-SCID mice to determine dia- betes incidence (n=5-11).

**Results:**
Low AGE dietary intake reduced the incidence of T1D in NODShiLt mice by 30% (p=0.002). Prediabetic LAGE fed mice had increased pancreatic islet numbers (average islet number/serial sec- tion, p<0.05). Furthermore, LAGE fed mice showed increased plasma insulin (p<0.0001), GLP-1 concentrations (p<0.0001), and changes in insulin tolerance with increased area under the curve following i.p.ITT in LAGE compared to HAGE fed (LAGE: 784.7 ± 169.9 mmol/L x 120min, HAGE: 538.2 ± 102.4 mmol/L x 120min, p<0.001). In com- bination therapy, RAGE expressing T cells (RAGE+CD3+) were reduced in BLD (p=0.062) and PLN (p<0.05) of HAGE + oRA treated mice compared to HAGE mice. oRA treatment increased proportions of regulatory CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ T cells (Treg) in SPL (p<0.05) and PLN ( p<0.05). An elevated expression of CD39+ CD73+ on Tregs in SPL and PLN (p<0.05); and CD39+ CD73+ KLRG1+ on Tregs from the MLN (p<0.05) was also observed with oRA treated mice. These data imply an increase in the activation status of Tregs with oRA. Additionally, NOD-SCID mice that received splenocytes from mice fed with HAGE + oRA therapy showed delay in T1D development (P<0.01) compared to HAGE.

**Conclusion:**
oRA induces changes in T cell homeostasis and regula- tory populations while the LAGE diet improved glucose homeostasis to prevent T1DM. Therefore, disrupting the AGE-RAGE axis by reducing dietary AGE intake or delivery of oRA are safe potential approaches to prevent or delay T1DM onset .

**Hide and seek: protecting human beta cells in type 1 diabetes by modulating their PDL1 and HLA class I expression**

**Background and aims:**
In type 1 diabetes (T1D), β-cells co-orches- trate their own demise by increasing their visibility to the immune system, stressing the importance of studying both the immune and the β-cell components of T1D in tandem. The balance between HLA Class I (HLA-I) and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) expression is par- ticularly critical: in T1D, β-cells overexpress HLA-I, which increases antigen presentation and immune targeting, but also upregulate PDL1, which can provide partial immune protection. Identifying strategies to dissociate these two opposing mechanisms could be key to new T1D therapies. To investigate previously suggested targets (e.g. TYK2, STAT2) and to identify new ones that can decouple HLA-I from PDL1 expression, we developed scalable methods using reaggregated primary human islet microtissues (MTs) and immune cells.

**Materials and methods:**
To enable accurate, high-throughput and long-term studies relevant to T1D pathology, we established three islet-immune injury models. These models involved cultur- ing islet MTs with proinflammatory cytokines (IFNα, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1β), activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or HLA-A2-re- stricted preproinsulin-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Next, we developed a range of biochemical and 3D microscopy based methods to assess β-cell function, β-cell death, T cell infiltration, cytokine secretion, HLA-I and PDL1 expression at single-islet resolution. To modify gene expression in islet MTs, we used shRNAs encoded by adeno-associated viruses delivered to the islets cells during aggrega- tion and achieved significant transduction efficiencies (up to 95%) and stable gene expression regulation for over 28 days in culture.

**Results:**
In the developed stress models, declining β-cell health manifested as increased basal and decreased glucose-stimulated insu- lin release, reduced intracellular insulin, loss of first-phase insulin response, and elevated proinsulin-to-insulin ratios. 3D microscopy revealed increased HLA-I and PDL1 expression on stressed islet cells, extensive T-cell infiltration, and β-cell killing in co-culture models. Liraglutide and HLA-I blocking antibodies demonstrated anti-inflammatory and immune-protective effects, serving as effec- tive controls. Next, we investigated TYK2-inhibitors (TYK2-i) and STAT2 knockdown (KD) as strategies to decouple HLA-I and PDL1 expression and protect islets from cytokine- or immune cell-medi- ated stress. In cytokine induced stress, TYK2i prevented islet cell death (p<0.001), significantly preserved intracellular insulin con- tent (+256%, p<0.001) and improved fold increase in insulin secre- tion (+182%, p<0.001) while decreasing expression of both HLA-I and PDL1 in 2 islet donors. The effects of STAT2 KD on cytokine treated-islet function, viability as well as HLA-I and PDL1 expres- sion were milder and did not reach statistical significance. We are currently evaluating novel strategies in the established islet-immune cell co-culture models.

**Conclusion:**
The described biomimetic human islet-immune assays represent scalable models for long-term and precise studies of early-stage T1D immunopathology and β-cell dysfunction. Our find- ings confirm the anti-inflammatory effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists, effective immune-evasion via HLA-I interference and the potential of TYK2i to protect β-cells during T1D progression.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. Recent evi- dence has implicated hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) as targets of auto- reactive CD4 T cells in human T1D patients and as potentially critical autoantigens recognized by diabetogenic T cells in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. HIPs form through a transpeptidation process in which proinsulin peptides are linked to beta cell protein fragments through cathepsin D (CatD)-mediated processes. Due to the unique composi- tion of these peptides they are likely not present in the thymus, making it plausible for autoreactive T cells that target HIPs to evade negative selection or tolerization in the thymus and enable autoimmune targeting of beta cells. Our study hypothesized that modifying the specific leu- cine residue targeted by CatD in insulin 2 C-peptide could reduce HIP formation and delay disease onset in the NOD mouse model of T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
We employed CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to generate NOD mice with a leucine to isoleucine (L26I) modification in the insulin 2 C-peptide. The research encompassed a comprehensive methodology including mass spectrometry analysis of islet peptidomes, LC-MS/MS detection of HIP formation, T cell reactivity assays using diabetes-triggering CD4 T cell clones, in vitro experiments with human and mouse C-peptides, and a rigorous one-year disease progression monitoring in both modified and wildtype NOD mice.

**Results:**
Genetic modification of the insulin 2 C-peptide produced significant reductions in CatD-mediated HIP formation, including 6.9HIP (p=0.002) and HIP11 (p=0.003) . Detailed analyses revealed substantially lower levels of HIPs in modified mouse islets, accompa- nied by reduced antigenicity of islets for HIP-reactive T cell clones. Most notably, the study demonstrated a significant delay (p=0.042) in diabetes onset, with approximately 43% of modified mice remaining disease-free after one year, compared to only 10% of wild-type mice. The research conclusively confirmed cathepsin D as the primary pro- tease mediating disease-relevant HIP formation in beta cells.

**Conclusion:**
By modifying the specific leucine residue in insulin 2 C-peptide, we effectively reduced HIP formation and delayed T1D pro- gression in NOD mice. These findings offer promising insights into autoimmune diabetes mechanisms, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing or delaying disease onset. The study provides a novel perspective on autoantigen generation and opens new avenues for interventional approaches in type 1 diabetes. Future research should explore modifications to both insulin 1 and insulin 2 C-peptides to comprehensively prevent HIP formation and further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying autoimmune diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) has rising incidence with limited prevention options, with anti-CD3 the only FDA-approved therapy for at risk individuals. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is expressed on islet and immune cells and targeted therapies slow T1DM onset, protect β-cell function and increase protec- tive regulatory T cells (Treg). Small molecules are preferred options for clinical translation, and hence the efficacy of oral RAGE antagonists (oRA) to delay T1DM onset was examined.

Female NOD mice (n=25/group) were randomised to oRA1 or oRA2 (3mg/kg q.d. oral gavage) or placebo (Veh) from day 50-64, then 3x weekly to day 150 of life and followed to day 225 for diabetes incidence or studied prediabetes (N=7-10/group) at day 64 (for immune cell phenotyping in blood and local lymphoid tissues; pancreatic β-cell infiltration and insulin content) or at day 92 (OGTT for β-cell function). Cytokine array and insulin autoantibody (IAA) titres (N=23-25) were assessed in serum. In the accelerated onset model, NOD mice were given anti-PD-L1 intraperitoneally (i.p.) (250ug/mouse; days -5, -3, -1; N=10) before commencing therapy with anti-CD3 or isotype control (i.p.) (5ug/mouse, days 1, 3, 5) alone, or in combination with oRA1 and oRA2 (3mg/kg/daily for 14 days then 3x/ week for 1 week). The incidence of diabetes, flow cytometry analysis and circulating lymphocytes during treatment were assessed.

**Results:**
oRA1 treatment delayed diabetes onset in mice with both low (HR=0.34[0.14-0.88], p=0.0147) or high (HR=0.44[0.18-1.07], p=0.0147) insulin autoantibody (IAA+) titres (p=0.0147) by day 225. At day 64, oRA treated mice had reduced islet infiltration (p<0.001) and higher pancreatic PD-1 (MFI) in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (p<0.05) and elevated expression of PD-1 on CD73+CD8+ T cells (p<0.01) compared to Veh, suggesting anergic transition of proliferating T cells. oRA1 also reduced RAGE+ expression on circulating CD8+ effector T cells (p<0.05). By day 90, oRA1 also consistently improved β-cell first-phase insulin secretion during oGTT (p<0.01). In an acute diabe- tes model using anti-PD-L1, the combination of anti-CD3 with oRA1 or oRA2 delayed diabetes (p=0.0721, p=0.0138) and reduced CD8+ T cells (%, p<0.01) in spleen (SPL) and pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) compared to Veh. In the SPL, compared to Veh and anti-CD3 alone, anti-CD3 + oRA1 had significantly higher CD4+TIM3+ (p<0.05, P=0.078), CD4+TIGIT+ (P<0.05, P<0.01), CD8+PD-1+ and CD8+TIM3+ (p<0.05, p=0.062) T cells. Anti-CD3 + oRA2 showed elevated CD4+PD-1+ (P<0.05, P=0.069), CD4+KLRG1+ (p<0.05), and higher T regulatory cells (Tregs, %; p<0.05) compared to Veh and anti-CD3 alone.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, these data suggest that combination of oRA and anti-CD3 act synergistically to delay accelerated autoimmune diabetes via modulation of T cells, promoting inhibitory molecules related to anergy and improved tolerance. Therefore, RAGE targeting therapeu- tics provide an attractive option for both standalone and combination therapies for T1DM prevention and treatment.

**Background and aims:**
The development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is linked to elevated insulin resistance (IR), with individuals at risk of T1D showing increased frequencies of circulating insulin-specific CD8 T cells. We hypothesized that CD8 T cells from the visceral adipose tis- sue (VAT) of T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients share phenotypic traits indicative of IR.

**Materials and methods:**
CD8 T cells were isolated from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of VAT obtained from T1D patients undergo- ing kidney-pancreas transplantation, obese patients with T2D (OB- T2D) or without diabetes (OB-ND) undergoing bariatric surgery, and lean controls (LC) undergoing cholecystectomy. Single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing (scRNA/TCR-seq) were performed to characterize VAT-derived CD8 T cell phenotypes and TCR clonotypes.

**Results:**
Preliminary analysis identified 18 CD8 T cell clusters in VAT, with memory cells exhibiting cytotoxic and exhausted phenotypes pre- dominating across all groups. Terminally exhausted CD8 T cells, iNKT cells, NK-like cells, and proliferating CD8 T cells were enriched in T1D patients, whereas OB-T2D samples showed higher frequencies of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic CD8 T cells. TCR sequencing revealed a more heterogeneous repertoire in T1D, with expanded clonotypes in transitional and polyfunctional CD8 T cells. Database searches for TCR antigen specificity identified public clonotypes predominantly specific to viral antigens, with no matches to islet autoantigens.

**Conclusion:**
Preliminary findings indicate an altered CD8 T cell profile in the VAT of T1D patients, characterized by expanded transitional and polyfunctional subsets. The absence of islet-specific public TCR clonotypes and the predominance of virus-specific clonotypes suggest that viral antigens may play a significant role in shaping the T cell repertoire within VAT.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes is typically found in young individuals but can also manifest later in life, particularly in the form of LADA(Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults). This study aims to describe the clinical and biological aspects of type 1 diabetes in adults over 30 years old, as well as the associated autoimmune diseases.

**Materials and methods:**
This is a retrospective and descriptive study involving 79 patients with type 1 diabetes, aged over 30 years, who were hospitalized in the Department of Diabetology, Endocrinology, and Nutrition at a University Hospital Center. The following param- eters were collected: clinical presentation, metabolic and biological profile, and autoimmune context. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 21.

**Results:**
The mean age of our series was 37± 9.3 years (30 to 78 years), with a sex ratio (M/F) of 0.7. Among our patients, 53.2% had a family history of type 1 diabetes. Additionally, 39.2% were hospitalized for an inaugural diabetes, while 60.8% had long-standing and poorly con- trolled diabetes, with an average duration of 3.7± 3.2 years. In terms of clinical evaluation, regarding body weight, the majority of patients were underweight (44.5%), followed by those with a normal body mass index (30%), 20% were overweight, and only 5.5% had grade I obe- sity. The mean HbA1c was 9.9 ± 2.5% (ranging from 5.4 to 15.8%). HyperLDLemia was the most frequent lipid abnormality, observed in 37.8%, followed by hypertriglyceridemia in 24.1%, and hypoHDLemia was present in 14% of the cases. Regarding degenerative status, diabetic nephropathy was observed in 20.2% of cases, diabetic retinopathy in 12%, and diabetic neuropathy in 10%.Regarding associated autoim- mune diseases, autoimmune thyroiditis was present in 6 patients, with anti-TPO antibodies positive in 6 patients (7.6%) and anti-TG anti- bodies positive in 5 patients (6.3%). Celiac disease was present in 4 patients, with anti-transglutaminase (IgA) antibodies positive.

**Conclusion:**
Type 1 diabetes presents unique aspects in adults: a pro- gressive nature with the potential for degenerative complications, and insulin resistance often associated with specific autoimmune mecha- nisms (LADA). Early diagnosis and rigorous follow-up are crucial for the management of this condition.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune condition marked by selective destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to insulin deficiency. At diagnosis, ~70-80% of β-cells are lost or dysfunctional. Nevertheless, residual insulin secretion often persists for years, and some individuals with long-standing T1D still exhibit detectable C-peptide, suggesting β-cell survival. This highlights β-cell resilience and has spurred interest in identifying factors sup- porting persistent β-cells in T1D. In this study, we aim to characterize resilient β-cells in long-standing T1D pancreata using spatial transcrip- tomics to identify survival-associated molecular pathways.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed FFPE pancreatic sections from 4 non-diabetic (ND) islet autoantibody-negative donors (age: 51 ± 13.9 years; 3F/1M; BMI: 30.8 ± 11.0) and 2 donors with long-standing T1D (age: 60 ± 29.8 years; 2F; BMI: 27.8 ± 4.0; disease duration: 21 and 45 years). Tissue quality was evaluated via H&E and insulin/glucagon immunofluorescence. RNA was extracted from serial FFPE sections and evaluated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer; samples with DV200 >30 were used. Spatial transcriptomics was performed using Visium CytAs- sist (10X Genomics) on 4 sections from ND and 4 from T1D (2 per donor). Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Data were demultiplexed using bcl-convert, and processed using Spac- eRanger. Low-expression spots (<10% of UMI counts) were excluded. Normalized data were clustered using unsupervised methods, followed by data integration and spatial projection. Differential expression was assessed using a Wilcoxon test (Log2FC ± 0.8, FDR<0.05) on endo- crine clusters.

**Results:**
Median detected genes per spot was 3,328 (ND) and 3,228 (T1D). Clustering on the 3,000 most variable genes identified 14 dis- tinct cell clusters. UMAP projection revealed good overlap across sam- ples, confirming reproducibility. As expected, CD8-positive immune spots were more frequent in T1D endocrine regions, with sparse islet infiltration. Endocrine cluster analysis, corresponding to insulin-pos- itive islets, revealed 168 differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05) between ND and T1D: 37 downregulated (Log2FC < -0.8), 131 upreg- ulated (Log2FC > 0.8). INS, IAPP, REG1B, and VGF were among the most downregulated in T1D. GO terms for these genes included glucose homeostasis and glycolytic regulation. Upregulated genes included TMSB4X, EGFL7, and MYO10, linked to cell growth and survival. GO terms enriched in T1D endocrine cells highlighted cell plasticity and survival pathways (e.g., regulation of Erk1/2 signaling, morphogenesis, and TGF-β signaling).

**Conclusion:**
Our data provide novel insights into the molecular pheno- type of persistent β-cells in long-standing T1D. Spatial transcriptomics revealed a distinctive transcriptional program suggestive of adaptation and survival. Further studies on recent-onset T1D and larger cohorts are required to validate these findings and understand the functional roles of the identified pathways.

**Background and aims:**
A systematic review on economic evaluations of pre-symptomatic Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) screening reveals that cost- effectiveness of existing T1D screening models depend on the extent of decrease in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events and the consequent improvement in long-term glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Fur- ther research concerning the impact on quality of life (QoL), is essen- tial to understand the value of screening. We seek to address these gaps and assess the impact of these elements on cost-effectiveness.

**Materials and methods:**
The EDENT1FI consortium established a diverse subgroup of stakeholders interested in health economic evalu- ations who met bi-weekly to refine assumptions, incorporate broader benefits, and enhance data inputs for an improved health economics model for T1D using literature. Based on these inputs, an early cost- effectiveness model for pre-symptomatic T1D screening was developed in Microsoft Excel® and associated key features were identified.

**Results:**
Our model for pre-symptomatic T1D screening has features beyond traditional economic models. Screening can be linked to an immediate short-term HbA1c improvement at stage 3 T1D onset, which subsequently reduces the risk of long-term complications. Pre-sympto- matic screening results, whether positive or negative, can significantly influence health-related QoL by impacting the emotional and psycho- logical well-being of both children and their parents, highlighting the importance of addressing these dimensions in early diagnosis. Parents of children diagnosed with T1D events like DKA can face income loss due to the sudden onset and lack of preparation time. Early identifica- tion of T1D through screening enables targeted education and monitor- ing, which can lead to better HbA1c control before stage 3 onset—a "soft landing." The interventions are less effective when applied after onset in unscreened individuals, underscoring the value of early detec- tion and intervention. The model also outlines the organisational impact of different screening strategies, offering insights into how healthcare systems can better manage T1D screening programs. While the model is promising, it requires validation and endorsement by the group to populate evidence and determine the magnitude of effects.

**Conclusion:**
This enhanced model offers a comprehensive under- standing of the health economic impact of T1D screening. Next steps involve aligning on hypotheses and evidence inclusion. Additional work is required to integrate the value of combining screening for other diseases, like celiac and thyroid, as practiced in some regions within EDENT1FI.

**Background and aims:**
Proper diagnosis of diabetes type is of para- mount importance for the optimal choice of the antihyperglycemic therapy. Diagnosing type 1 diabetes in adult individuals is particularly challenging due to variability in autoantibodies titres and varied clini- cal presentation at diagnosis. With growing incidence of autoimmune diabetes worldwide the issue of optimal set of autoantibodies to be assessed at the diagnosis is of increasing importance. We conducted the study to evaluate autoimmune profiles of newly diagnosed adult type 1 diabetes individuals for 6 months after the diagnosis.

**Materials and methods:**
50 individuals aged ≥18 years with newly diagnosed diabetes, which had typical clinical presentation of type 1 diabetes were enrolled into the study. The following autoantibod- ies levels were determined in all patients at the moment of diagnosis and 3 and 6 months thereafter: glutamic acid decarboxylase antibod- ies (GADA; IU/ml), insulin antibodies (IAA; COI), zinc transporter 8 antibodies (ZnT8; AU/ml), thyrosine phosphatase antibodies (IA-2; IU/ml) and serum C-peptide level. The tests were performed using the chemiluminescence method (CLIA) labelled with acridinium ester on the i-Flash 1800 YHLO Biotech analyzer using reagent kits offered by Biomaxima S.A.

**Results:**
Full data were obtained in 44 patients. At the diagnosis mean age (±SD) of all individuals was 30.9±8.7 yrs (range 18-59), BMI 24.2±5.9 kg/m2 (18.2-37.5), HbA1c 11.0±2.6% (4.9-15.8), pH 7.317±0.081 (6.99-7.39). No statistically significant differences were found between GADA, IA-2 and ZnT8 titres at the diagnosis and after 3 or 6 months after the diagnosis. However, IAA titre doubled (p<0.01) within the first 3 months since the diagnosis (Table 1). Six patients were GADA negative throughout the study period, however they were ZnT8 and IAA positive. Four patients were GADA nega- tive at the diagnosis, and they conversed to be GADA positive after 3 and 6 months. No statistically significant differences in clinical or autoimmune variables were found between GADA negative or posi- tive patients, those aged < or ≥35 yrs or with HbA1c < or ≥11.0% at presentation. C-peptide level remained stable during the follow-up and was 1.64±1.5 at the diagnosis, 1.99±1.52 after 3 and 1.78±1.27 after 6 months (p>0.05).

**Conclusion:**
GADA are absent at the diagnosis in almost 25% of adult type 1 patients, therefore assessing ZnT8 and IAA may be used to confirm type 1 diabetes in these cases. Autoimmune profile of newly diagnosed adult type 1 diabetes patients remains largely stable for 6 months after the diagnosis, with the exception of IAA, which titre increases after the diagnosis. As autoimmune profile is independent of clinical characteristics for 6 months after the diagnosis, therefore the recommendation to assess autoantibodies in all patients with newly diagnosed diabetes seems warranted.

**Evaluation of clinical, laboratory and immunological characteris- tics in the early onset (diagnosed age < 30 years old) patients with type 2 diabetes**

T. Oh

**Background and aims:**
The classification of early onset (< 30 years old) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) as either type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be a challenge due to their similar overlapping phenotypes. In our present study, we attempted to utilize various clinical and laboratory characteristics in combination with immunological factors in the blood to determine whether it would be possible to distinguish and more accurately characterize our patients as T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Electronic medical records were evaluated to obtain information categorized as either early onset patients with DM (n=102) and patients with T1D (n=89). Using the stored serum from these patients, autoantibodies of anti-IA2, anti-ZnT8 and anti-GAD were measured.

**Results:**
In the clinical characteristics, early onset patients with DM (n=102) were younger (p < 0.01), more overweight (p < 0.05), shorter duration of diabetes (p < 0.01) and a more prevalent family history of diabetes (p < 0.0) than patients with T1D. The laboratory values from early onset patients with DM exhibited lower HbA1c and glucose levels (p < 0.01, respectively) with conversely higher C-peptide levels (p < 0.01). Measurements of immunological factors, demonstrated that the prevalence of anti-ZnT8 (2%) and anti-GAD antibody (2%) in early onset patients with DM was significantly lower (p<0.01) compared to patients with T1D (13% for anti-ZnT8 and 38% for anti-GAD). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, C-peptide level (B 4.453, P < 0.001) was the strongest independent factor to distinguish early onset patients with DM as T2D. After adjusting C-peptide level, family his- tory of diabetes (B 0.830, P = 0.048), BMI (B 0.111, P = 0.004) and the relative negative status of anti-GAD (B -2.041, P < 0.001) were determining factors in our analyses.

**Conclusion:**
In this study, our findings suggested that early onset patients with DM may be more accurately diagnosed as T2D if they have a compilation of elevated C-peptide levels, higher BMI, more prevalent history of familial diabetes and the absence of detecting anti- GAD antibodies.

2. UK, EpitogenX Ltd., Aberdeen, UK, NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Despite the well-established role of autoan- tigens (IAA, IA-2, GAD65, and ZnT8) in the development of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), a single, all-encompassing serological assay remains unavailable, impacting effectively the screening of high-risk individuals and delaying significantly diagnosis. The existing diagnostic platforms are unable to integrate all key autoantigens and incorporate into one test the immunodominant linear epitopes. Hence, there are limitations regarding the sensitivity of the assay. Our aim is the development of a comprehensive platform for conclusive serological screening of T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Our approach combines two innovative technologies. Firstly, EpitoPredikt™, an AI-driven platform that identifies immunodominant epitopes “hotspots” within islet autoan- tigens. Secondly, Epitogen® Scaffold technology, which enables the efficient expression of multiplexed linear epitopes, large conforma- tional epitopes, subunits, and full antigens. Previously validated in developing a multi-antigen Lyme disease assay, this platform is now being re-purposed towards the diagnosis of T1D. Immunodominant regions of islet autoantigens were identified, cloned into the scaffold system, and expressed through E. coli. The recombinant epitopes were screened for IgM, IgG, and IgA using samples from T1D, T2D, and assigned-healthy subjects to confirm antigenicity and specificity. The most prevalent epitopes will be multiplexed into mosaic antigens to create a highly sensitive and specific screening test.

**Results:**
We are an accurate and one-step serology-based diagnostic test for T1D. Our platform integrates all immunodominant islet autoan- tigens into one test to enhance sensitivity and specificity.

**Conclusion:**
This novel technology has the potential to improve early detection and classification of T1D, providing a more reliable and effi- cient diagnostic tool.

3. betes and Regeneration Research, Neuherberg, Germany, Fondazione

**Background and aims:**
The progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and ultimately to overt diabetes is associated with morphological and functional alterations in pancreatic islets. The insulin receptor (IR) and its downstream signal- ing in beta cells play a crucial role for the compensatory adaptations occurring during prediabetes. Recently, a negative regulator of the IR, named inceptor (insulin inhibitory receptor; IIR; ELAPOR), has been identified. Knockout models for inceptor have demonstrated increased insulin secretion and enhanced beta cell proliferation. Aim of this study was to characterize inceptor expression in human islets in the progres- sive stages of diabetes development.

**Materials and methods:**
First, we analysed transcriptomic and pro- teomic data on inceptor in human islets from the HumanIslets.com portal. Subsequently, we obtained pancreatic tissue samples from indi- viduals who had undergone comprehensive metabolic phenotyping and pancreatic surgery. These samples were processed for immunofluores- cence staining for insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and inceptor. Slides were imaged at confocal microscope. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ and Qupath.

**Results:**
Our findings indicate that inceptor is expressed in all endo- crine cells within the human pancreas, with the highest mRNA levels detected in alpha cells. No significant differences in inceptor gene expression or protein abundance were observed in islets across differ- ent stages of diabetes development (p=0.673; p=0.075). Immunofluo- rescence analysis revealed a predominantly perinuclear localization of inceptor, consistent with its primary localization is in the trans Golgi network (TGN). Inceptor was detected in insulin-, glucagon- and soma- tostatin- positive cells. Inceptor intensity in islets was not significantly different in subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes mellitus (DM) (p=0.344). When specifically analysing beta cells, we found lower inceptor intensity in IGT individuals compared to NGT and DM (p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Inceptor is primarily localized in the TGN of pancreatic endocrine cells. Its gene expression and protein abundance are stable across the natural history of type 2 diabetes, from NGT to DM. How- ever, in beta cells, inceptor levels appear to decrease in IGT, suggesting potential dynamic changes of inceptor in response to increased beta cell workload during prediabetes.

**Exposure to maternal gestational hyperglycaemia impacts pancre- atic islet morphology and beta cell function in mice offspring**

1. University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands, Nestlé

**Background and aims:**
Maternal hyperglycaemia is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the offspring. Imprinting of metabolic changes in the offspring due to in utero expo- sure to diabetes is, however, poorly understood. As disturbed pancreatic islet function plays a pivotal role in the development of T2DM, we investigated the impact of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy on offspring’s pancreatic β-cell function, islet morphology and glucose tolerance using a mouse model of maternal gestational hyperglycaemia.

**Materials and methods:**
Maternal hyperglycaemia was induced in C57BL/6N female mice by short-term high-fat (HF) diet and low-dose streptozotocin injections before mating. Prior to mating, animals were screened for pre-gestational diabetes (PDM), while gestational diabetes (GDM) was confirmed on gestational day (GD) 15. Control dams either received HF or low-fat (LF) diets. Offspring were fed a high-fat high- sucrose diet from weaning and β-cell function, islet morphology and glu- cose tolerance were assessed in the offspring around postnatal day 100.

**Results:**
In female mice, glucose tolerance was impaired in offspring of PDM dams compared to LF and HF dams (glucose AUC; LF 439 ± 21 vs HF 485 ± 21 vs GDM 494 ± 27 vs PDM 585 ± 14, p<0.05). At 10 minutes after the oral glucose bolus, blood insulin levels were increased in LF and HF offspring (p<0.01), but not in GDM or PDM offspring. Beta-cell func- tion was decreased in female offspring of PDM compared to LF dams (delta insulin/delta glucose; LF 0.100 ± 0.014 vs HF 0.069 ± 0.023 vs GDM 0.050 ± 0.019 vs PDM 0.012 ± 0.011, p<0.05). In the GDM and PDM offspring, beta-cell area was decreased (beta-cell area %; LF 0.75 ± 0.07, HF 0.64 ± 0.05, GDM 0.47 ± 0.06, PDM 0.44 ± 0.08, p<0.05) and more alpha-cells were present in the islets compared to LF offspring (alpha-cell/ islet area (no./mm ); LF 946 ± 121 vs HF 1132 ± 179 vs GDM 2065 ± 332 vs PDM 2014 ± 157, p<0.05). Male offspring showed similar results. The changes in pancreatic morphology of offspring correlated with the sever- ity of maternal hyperglycaemia at the end of gestation (r=0.33, p<0.05). RNA sequencing data on isolated islets confirmed increased expression of glucagon and decreased expression of insulin in GDM offspring.

**Conclusion:**
Hyperglycaemia in pregnancy significantly impacts the pancreatic islet composition and glucose tolerance in offspring, with effects corresponding to the severity of the maternal hyperglycaemia. Thus, in utero exposure to hyperglycaemia influences islet develop- ment, which could predispose offspring to develop T2DM.

**Does in utero gestational diabetes exposure impair circadian meta- bolic rhythms in the offspring?**

1. University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, Physiology and

**Background and aims:**
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), one of the most common complications of pregnancy, significantly increases type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in the exposed offspring. Recent studies show that GDM exposure impairs insulin secretion in young- adult offspring; however, the mechanisms that drive pancreatic beta cell impairment, and ultimately T2D risk in GDM-exposed offspring remain poorly understood. Recent evidence highlights an integral role for the circadian clock timing system in the control of insulin secre- tion and glucose homeostasis, with an ever-growing body of evidence supporting circadian disruption as a strong contributor to T2D risk. Here, we hypothesized that GDM exposure disrupts circadian rhythms in the offspring, impairing glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and conferring greater T2D risk.

**Materials and methods:**
To induce GDM, C57BL6/J female mice were fed a high-fat and -sucrose (HFS) diet for 6 weeks, while control females were fed a chow diet. All females were bred with healthy male mice and pregnancy established. Pregnant dam blood glucose was tracked each tri- mester to monitor for hyperlycemia and GDM development. At 3 weeks of age, all offspring were weaned onto a standard chow diet and assessed at 4-6 weeks of age for various aspects of circadian activity and circadian cycles of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion capacity.

**Results:**
GDM exposure altered offspring whole-body metabolic cycles, in a sex-specific manner, whereby male GDM-exposed off- spring showed dampened carbohydrate metabolism in the dark/ active phase of the day. Importantly, GDM-exposed offspring dis- played abnormal rhythms of glucose tolerance, with significant glu- cose intolerance observed in the dark/active phase of daily cycle. Alterations in glucose tolerance were accompanied by changes in daily cycles of insulin secretion capacity, revealing significantly dampened insulin secretion in the dark phase of the daily cycle in GDM-exposed offspring. Notably, this dampened insulin secretion in GDM-exposed offspring was restored by treatment with Nobiletin, a flavonoid that targets the circadian clock and “boosts” rhythms.

**Conclusion:**
Our studies suggests that GDM exposure sig- nificantly impacts several aspects of circadian metabolic rhythms in the offspring, including daily cycles of insulin secretion and glucose tolerance, providing mechanistic insight into how GDM exposure increases T2D risk in offspring. Moreover, our data demonstrates that there is a differential impact of GDM exposure on male and female offspring. These emergent findings suggest that explora- tion of circadian-based interventions (e.g.., intermittent fasting) in a sex-specific manner are warranted to reduce T2D risk in GDM- exposed offspring.

**Background and aims:**
Calorie restriction (CR) can improve meta- bolic metabolism and may lead to longevity of cells. In the pancreas, CR modulates connectivity, identity, survival, mitochondrial struc- ture-function, and insulin release of beta cells. Although the effects of CR are known, the function of how insulin release is altered was not explored yet. Previous studies revealed higher mitochondria density in cells with denser cristae. Furthermore, long-lived cells are more abundant in islets from CR mice. Based on these findings, we hypoth- esized higher metabolic capacity of CR islets due to higher cytosolic [cAMP]. Moreover, we wanted to explore whether the improved insulin reactivity might be caused by higher functional connectivity between the cells due to longevity.

**Materials and methods:**
FVB-mice were either fed ad libitum (AL) or put on a 20 % calorie restricted diet. We prepared acute pancreatic tis- sue slices. Slices were incubated with a low-affinity calcium indicator. We performed high-frequency confocal imaging while perfusing the slices with physiological solutions and different pharmacological com- pounds (acetylcholine (ACh), epinephrine (Epi)). Events were extracted from the ­Ca traces after imaging. EM images were done using elec- tron tomography (ET). We did ET to evaluate CR ER morphology. Net- works were constructed as an undirected graph as nodes representing cells being connected if functional correlation was observed. We used standard network parameters to compare islets between the groups.

**Results:**
Our results show that CR beta cells react with faster oscilla- tions to increasing levels (6 mM, 8 mM, 10 mM) of glucose while fre- quency stays the same in fast and slow oscillations. When dampening cell activity by Epi application, resulting in lower [cAMP], CR islets showed higher baseline activity, indicating higher metabolism or basal [cAMP]. Surprisingly, ­EC is lower and Hill coefficient is higher in CR islets. CR islets also displayed a longer pause in oscillations while Epi treatment, suggesting a possible shift of pathways. In contrast, simulating high [cAMP] by stimulating with ACh, we observed better stress resistance in CR beta cells based on the times needed to exhaust the islet. Although CR beta cells need longer to exhaust the ­Ca stores, we saw higher frequency of events, confirming previous findings in stimulating glucose conditions. Surprisingly, networks of CR islets were less correlated, contrasting our initial hypothesis.

**Conclusion:**
We show that CR enhances glucose homeostasis at both the organismal and organelle levels. We suggest that [cAMP] and ­[Ca ] are increased, reflecting the changes in mitochondrial metabo- lism. Although islet cells are in a community for longer in CR mice, the network connectivity shows the opposite. Speculating, it might be that the cells imprinted the behavior of neighboring cells, so less crosstalk is needed during secretion. All in all, we show and provide valuable evidence that CR improves beta cell function. However, the change in pathways, proposed by the event pause in Epi, needs to be investigated further in future experiments.

**Background and aims:**
Reduced pancreatic β-cell mass (BCM) is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Since therapeutic strategies for diabetes to maintain BCM by stimulating β-cell replication are desir- able, elucidating the mechanisms involved in β-cell proliferation is war- ranted. Activating transcription factor 6α (ATF6α), a membrane-bound transcription factor, is essential for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Based on single cell RNA-sequencing of islets from c57BL/6 mice undergoing partial pancreatectomy (PPTx)-induced β-cell pro- liferation, we previously reported transient upregulation of ER stress response-associated genes in β-cells during pseudo-time course from matured to proliferating status. Particularly, we confirmed increased expression of ATF6α in early response to PPTx in mouse islets. How- ever, its significance remains unclear in vivo. Therefore, we explored the role of ATF6α in the regulation of BCM and β-cell proliferation.

**Materials and methods:**
RIP-Cre;ATF6α (ATF6α ) mice with β-cell-specific ATF6α deletion were established, and ATF6α lit- termates were used as control. 60 kcal% high-fat diet (HFD) and preg- nancy were employed as inducible β-cell proliferation models in vivo. Body weight and non-fasting blood glucose levels were measured weekly under normal diet (ND) or HFD feedings. Intraperitoneal glu- cose tolerance tests (IPGTTs) were conducted in HFD-fed mice at 6 (baseline) and 18 weeks of age. BCM, BrdU-positive and TUNEL- positive β-cell rates were Immunohistochemically analyzed at 26 weeks (ND or HFD-fed) and 12-14 weeks (pregnant and non-pregnant). Addi- tionally, ATF6α knockdown (ATF6αKD) by siRNA was performed in ­MIN6 cells (an in vitro β-cell model under chronic ER stress), and unstressed MIN6 cells. Proliferation was assessed by gene expressions of proliferation markers, Ki-67 staining and MTT assay, while apopto- sis was evaluated by TUNEL staining and active/full-length caspase-3 protein ratio.

**Results:**
ATF6α mice exhibited significantly higher non-fasting blood glucose levels than controls after 8-week HFD feeding (p < 0.05). Consistently, HFD-fed ATF6α mice showed glucose intoler- ance in IPGTT at 18 weeks of age. Immunohistochemistry revealed sig- nificantly reduced BCM (p < 0.05) as well as lower BrdU-positive (p < 0.05) and higher TUNEL-positive (p < 0.05) β-cell rates in both HFD- fed and pregnant ATF6α mice, while no differences were observed in ND-fed and non-pregnant conditions. ATF6αKD ­MIN6 cells displayed significantly decreased Pcna expression (p < 0.01), lower Ki-67-positive (p < 0.05) and higher TUNEL-positive (p < 0.001) rates compared to control cells, whereas unstressed MIN6 cells showed no differences. Moreover, ATF6αKD ­MIN6 cells displayed signifi- cantly attenuated time-dependent proliferation in MTT assay (p < 0.01) and increased active/full-length caspase-3 protein ratio (p < 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
In multiple β-cell proliferation models, β-cell-specific ATF6α deletion reduced BCM via decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, highlighting an important role of ATF6α in the regulation of BCM and β-cell replication in adult.

**The metabolic key enzyme ALDOB is upregulated in cell clusters in pancreatic islets of human living donors with type 2 diabetes**

**Background and aims:**
Previous studies reported a significant upregu- lation of Aldolase, Fructose-Bisphosphate B (ALDOB) mRNA and protein expression in laser-capture microdissected (LCM) pancreatic islets from metabolically profiled living donors (LD) with type 2 dia- betes (T2D). However, due to the lack of antibodies capable of reli- ably distinguishing ALDOB from other aldolase isoforms, its cellular origin and distribution within islets remained unclear. To overcome these limitations, including stress artefacts induced by enzymatic islet digestion for conventional single-cell sequencing, we employed spatial single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses .

**Materials and methods:**
Utilising the novel Xenium 5k platform, we developed and implemented an screening approach to spatially resolve the expression of 5,101 genes at subcellular resolution in for- malin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pancreatic sections from LD classified as non-diabetic (ND), with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or with T2D. Proteomic analyses of spatially enriched alpha and beta cell pools from comparable samples of the same LD were conducted using the Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) workstream, incorporating AI-based single-cell segmentation and classification via immunofluo- rescence imaging, automated LCM, and high-sensitivity mass spec- trometry (MS).

**Results:**
Among thousands of detected gene products, we success- fully quantified all three aldolase isoenzyme transcripts at the single- cell level in both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic cells, as well as at the proteomic level in LCM-enriched alpha and beta cell samples. Both datasets demonstrated a significant and progressive upregula- tion of ALDOB expression corresponding with increasing glycaemia, whereas ALDOA and ALDOC expression levels remained stable. Tran- scriptomic analysis revealed a log fold change (log FC) > 4 in islets, primarily driven by hyperactivated clusters of beta cells. Proteomic data showed a log FC of 2.3 in enriched alpha cell samples and 3.9 in enriched beta cell samples.

**Conclusion:**
This study provides the first evidence that ALDOB, but not other aldolase isoforms, is progressively upregulated in pancreatic islet cell clusters—particularly of beta cells—during the progression to T2D. Elevated ALDOB expression in beta cells may contribute to dys- regulated cell physiology by altering metabolic fluxes, AMPK/mTOR- mediated gene regulation, and the dissolution of ­mRNA / G3BP1/2 condensates.

**Serum pancreatic regeneration protein Iα tendency in acute pan- creatitis to post pancreatitis diabetes acute: comparative analysis and distinction from type 2 diabetes**

Z. Shu

1. Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, Zhongda

**Background and aims:**
Reg Iα (Regenerating Protein I α, Reg Iα), an acute-phase protein primarily produced by acinar cells, is upregu- lated in response to pancreatic injury, leading to increased serum levels. This protein promotes islet cell regeneration and prolifera- tion, inhibits pancreatic stellate cell activation, and contributes to the protection of endocrine function and prevention of pancreatic fibrosis. Our previous study showed a positive correlation between serum Reg I levels, the duration of Type 2 diabetes, and glycated hemoglobin. This study aimed to measure the serum reg I levels of pancreatitis and PPDM-A (diabetes after acute pancreatitis, ppdm- a) at different stages and compare them with the levels of type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
This study compared serum Reg I levels and tendency among 89 patients across six groups: 20 healthy con- trols (male 10 cases), 20 patients with new onset T2DM (male 10 cases), 14 patients with long-term T2DM (male 7 cases), 15 patients with acute pancreatitis (male 9 cases), 9 patients in AP remission (male 5 cases), and 10 patients with PPDM-A(male 5 cases).Col- lected data included age, gender, serum Reg Iα, and CRP. Differences in serum Reg Iα between groups were analyzed using t-tests and non-parametric tests.

**Results:**
Serum Reg I α levels were as follows: healthy controls, 16.20 [12.60, 19.80]; new onset T2DM, 16.39 [11.38, 21.40]; long- term T2DM, 36.62 [23.72, 49.51] ; AP, 74.63 [53.58, 95.76] ; AP remission, 83.96 [64.89, 103.00] ; and PPDM-A, 51.55 [41.61, 61.47] ng/ml.Statistical analysis revealed that serum Reg I α levels in the long-term T2DM group were significantly higher than those in the healthy control and new onset T2DM groups (P < 0.01). No significant difference was observed between the AP and AP remis- sion groups; however, AP remission groups had significantly higher levels than the PPDM-A group (P<0.01). Additionally, the PPDM- A group had significantly higher levels than the long-term T2DM group (P < 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
This study revealed that serum Reg I α levels in newly diagnosed T2DM patients were similar to healthy controls, sug- gesting unchanged Reg I α secretion in early diabetes. In contrast, long-term T2DM patients exhibited elevated Reg I α, potentially due to chronic pancreatic injury stimulating islet cell regeneration and anti-fibrosis. Acute pancreatitis patients showed a sharp increase in Reg I α secretion in response to pancreatic injury, promoting repair. Post-pancreatitis remission, sustained high Reg I α levels indicated ongoing pancreatic repair. PPDM-A patients had higher Reg I α lev- els than T2DM patients, possibly due to severer pancreatic lesions and endocrine dysfunction from exocrine injury, though the exact mechanisms require further investigation. The significantly higher Reg I α levels in PPDM-A versus T2DM may serve as a biomarker for differentiating these diabetes types, pending further validation.

**Analysis of publicly available human islet datasets indicates sex differences in resilience to type 2 diabetes**

S.-Y. Chen

**Background and aims:**
Sex differences exist in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is higher in males than females. Prior stud- ies have indicated improved endoplasmic reticulum stress resilience and protein synthesis in female islets, but the implications for islet adaptation to T2D remain unclear. Herein we sought to elucidate the impact of biological sex on T2D-induced changes in human islets using publicly available datasets.

**Materials and methods:**
Gene expression and physiology data from PancDB and Humanislets.com (Hi) were analysed by sex while controlling for age, comparing donors with T2D to control donors without diabetes. Where available, multiple datasets for the same outcome were compared.

**Results:**
Among islets from control donors aged 15-39, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of PancDB beta-cell scRNAseq and Hi bulk RNAseq data showed robust enrichment in female islets of transla- tion-related pathways, e.g. KEGG pathway “Ribosome” (p<0.00004, n=7-18) and Reactome pathways “Peptide chain elongation” and “Formation of a pool of free 40S subunits” (p<0.02, n=7-18), among others. In the bulk RNAseq data, GO cell components “mitochon- drial membrane” and “mitochondrial envelope” were also enriched in female islets (p<0.02, n=8-18). Consistent with the notion of higher translation capacity in females, there was a robust trend toward higher neutral solution-soluble insulin content in control islets from females compared to males (PancDB: 30±4.2 vs 16±3.5 ng/islet, p=0.05, n= 10-12; Hi: 5±0.16 vs 4.6±0.13 arbitrary abun- dance, p=0.05, n=40-77). Among donors with T2D and BMI >30, female islets retained greater total insulin content than male islets (PancDB UPenn: 30±4 vs 7±1.7 ng/islet, p=0.016, n=4-8; PancDB Vanderbilt: 11±1.5 vs 6.5±1.1 ng/IEQ, p=0.025, n=7-14; Hi: 16±1 vs 13±1.4 ng/IEQ, p=0.07, n=11-12). Mitochondrial activity is cen- tral to glucose sensing. Among control donors, female islets had lower spare respiratory capacity than male islets (93±15 vs 143±16 %, p=0.036, n=21-23). However, with T2D, male islets showed a loss of spare respiratory capacity relative to controls (49.5±10.5 vs 143±16 %, p=0.025, n=7-23) that was not observed in female islets (116±25 vs 93.2±15 %, n=13-21). Furthermore, male T2D islets were less able to augment oxygen consumption following high glucose compared to controls (0.0007±0.0089 vs 0.045±0.006 nmol/ min*100 islets, p=0.025, n=7-23), but this defect was not observed among female islets (0.026±0.01 vs 0.036±0.005 nmol/min*100 islets, n=13-22). However, downstream of mitochondrial respiration, high glucose-induced insulin secretion (AUC) was impaired in T2D islets of both sexes compared to controls, in two out of three sets of perifusion data (Males - PancDB UPenn: 18.5±5.5 vs 32.5±4.4, p=0.0055, n=10-40; Hi: 4804±956 vs 7342±423, p<0.0001, n=17- 150; Females - PancDB UPenn: 21.5±2.9 vs 38±4.9, p=0.0011, n=19-32; Hi: 3627±606 vs 6226±393, p=0.0046, n=16-86). In the third set, males showed a significant impairment with T2D (PancDB Vanderbilt: 22.1±6.2 vs 38.6±4.8, p=0.022, n=12-34) but females did not (PancDB Vanderbilt: 25.9±4.5 vs 31.5±3.6, n=16-30).

**Conclusion:**
While further investigation and cross-validation are required, these data suggest that female islets maintain greater function in T2D by retaining insulin synthesis and glucose sensing functions, but not necessarily insulin secretion. Understanding sex differences at the level of the islet is important for considering and developing sex-informed treatments.

**The reduction of pancreatic noradrenergic innervation, conse- quent to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, restores the first-phase of insulin secretion**

A. Avolio, T. Mezza, G. Di Giuseppe, G. Ciccarelli, M. Brunetti, L. Soldovieri, A. Giaccari, F. Cinti

**Background and aims:**
Β-cell dedifferentiation has been recognized as one of the main mechanisms responsible for β-cell failure in T2D and accounts for 30% of β-cell in human type 2 diabetes (T2D). In a previous study, we found that noradrenergic innervation, which inhibits insulin secretion, is significantly increased in the islets of diabetic subjects, directly related to the percent of dedifferentiated cells within the islets, inversely related to β-cell secretion and glu- cose tolerance. Recently, we demonstrated that Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), a widely used bariatric surgery technique, reduces entero-pancreatic noradrenergic fibers, inducing the re-differentiation of β-cells and thereby improving glucose tolerance and leading to TD2 remission.We aimed to evaluate the impact of the reduction of pancreatic noradrenergic innervation, by RYGB, on β-cell function, especially on the first early-phase of insulin secretion, which is usu- ally the first to be lost in the pathogenesis of the disease.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed a glucose tolerance test (GTT) on obese diabetic Zucker FA/FA rats, after 14 hours of fast- ing, before and 6 weeks after the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery or SHAM. Moreover, we quantified noradrenergic fibers by immunohistochemistry and assessed the dedifferentiation score in the pancreas samples.

**Results:**
During metabolic evaluation, we observed a significant reduction in total glucose levels in the RYGB group compared to the SHAM group, as determined by the area under the curve (AUC) (p<0.0001). Additionally, there was a restoration of first-phase insu- lin secretion, assessed as insulin production at 15 minutes, with a 36% increase in insulin production at 15 minutes during the GTT (p 0.0075). We found a significant association between the reduction of the number of noradrenergic fibers/island and the increase in insulin secretion at 15 minutes (p 0.02), suggesting that the reduction of noradrenergic innervation is related to the restoration of the first- phase of insulin production after RYGB.

**Conclusion:**
Noradrenergic fibers might be directly involved in the process of dedifferentiation of pancreatic β-cells. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass induces a significant reduction of pancreatic noradrenergic fibers and consequently the redifferentiation of β-cells, with restora- tion of the early-phase of insulin secretion, which is the first to be lost in the pathogenesis of the disease, and improvement of glucose tolerance.This hypothesis might provide a new potential explanation for the remission of type 2 diabetes, after bariatric surgery

**Delineating the role of CHD4 in pancreatic islet development**

A. Das Sharma, J.M. ­Spaeth

1. Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Indiana University
2. School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA, Department of Pediatrics,

**Background and aims:**
Strategies to increase β-cell mass by direct- ing stem cells toward a β-cell fate are a putative therapy for diabetes. Thus, understanding transcriptional programs governing endocrine pro- genitor differentiation is crucial for these efforts. Previously, we have shown the PDX1 transcription factor, an essential regulator of pan- creas development, interacts with the CHD4 subunit of the Nucleosome Remodelling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex in mature β-cells to maintain glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion . RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq analysis of -deficient β-cells revealed chromatin and gene expression changes, particularly at the locus. Given the role of NEUROG3 in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation, we sought to investigate the role of CHD4 in endocrine progenitor cells, a transient population that relies on PDX1 activity during development. Here, we hypothesize that CHD4 controls chromatin accessibility and gene expression programs essential for endocrine cell development.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed a proximity ligation assay to investigate CHD4 and PDX1 interaction in E15.5 mouse embryos. Then we generated mice with endocrine-progenitor-specific ( - Cre) deficiency ( ). Whole-body metabolic phenotyp- ing, including glucose tolerance, ad libitum-fed blood glucose, and serum insulin/glucagon measurements were taken in postnatal mice. Preliminary histological characterisation of β-cell maturity markers, including, insulin, PDX1, MAFA and UCN3 was performed on the pancreatic tissues.

**Results:**
Proximity ligation assay on pancreatic sections from E15.5 mouse embryos revealed interactions between PDX1 and CHD4 in endocrine progenitor cells. Immunofluorescence staining con- firmed successful CHD4 knockout in the whole islet (n=5). Postna- tally, mice develop severe hyperglycemia starting at 6 weeks of age (n=5, p<0.001), accompanied by pronounced glucose intoler- ance beginning at 4 weeks (n=5, p<0.05) and worsening by 8 weeks (n=5, p<0.001). This is associated with reduced serum insulin levels (n=7-8, p<0.001), while glucagon levels remain unaffected (n=7- 8, p=0.1892). Immunofluorescence imaging shows reduced MAFA expression (n=3, p<0.05) and the presence of insulin- and glucagon- co-expressing cells (n=3) in the islets of 6-week-old mice. By 8 weeks, these mutants display altered islet morphology along with reduced PDX1 (n=3, p<0.01), MAFA (n=3, p<0.001), UCN3 (n=3, p<0.01) and insulin (n=3, p<0.01) levels. Notably, the num- ber of glucagon-positive cells per islet tends to increase (n=3) in 8-week-old mutants.

**Conclusion:**
These preliminary data suggest that CHD4 loss from endocrine progenitor cells significantly impacts postnatal glucose homeostasis. We predict these deficiencies derive from the failed allo- cation of islet cells during endocrine development. To delineate the mechanistic action of CHD4 in modulating the chromatin landscape to permit proper islet formation, single-cell RNA, single-nucleus ATAC- seq and CUT&RUN will be performed on endocrine committed cells from mutant embryos.

**Decoding CHD5: unveiling its role in pancreatic beta cell health and function**

S. Nag, A. Das ­Sharma, A. ­Taylor, J.M. ­Spaeth

1. Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine,
2. Indianapolis, IN, USA, Department of Biochemistry & Molecular

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) is a pivotal transcription factor necessary for pancreatic beta cell development, function, and maintenance. Dysregulation of PDX1 contributes to beta cell dysfunction and the onset of dia- betes. Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein 5 (CHD5), a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, is known to regulate transcription, though its role in beta cells remains poorly understood. Previous findings identified CHD4, another NuRD complex member, as a PDX1-interacting pro- tein in beta cells. Interestingly, CHD4 knockout results in CHD5 upregulation, suggesting a potential compensatory relationship. This study investigates the role of CHD5 in beta cell function and its interaction with PDX1, hypothesizing that CHD5 contributes to maintaining beta cell integrity and insulin secretion.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed Co-immunoprecipita- tion (Co-IP) and Proximity Ligation Assays (PLA) in MIN6 and EndoC-βH1 cell line and mouse islets to investigate CHD5 and PDX1 interactions. Next, we generated a beta cell-specific CHD5 knockout mouse model ( ) utilizing tamoxifen-inducible MIPCre-ER transgenic mice crossed with mice containing loxP sites flanking Chd5 exon 2. Successful CHD5 knockout was confirmed through immunofluorescence staining. To assess blood glucose con- trol, glucose tolerance tests (GTT) were performed on both male and female mice four weeks after tamoxifen treatment. Additionally, protein analysis of pancreatic tissue was conducted to evaluate key beta cell markers, including insulin, MAFA, Urocortin 3, Chromogranin A and B.

**Results:**
Co-IP and PLA confirmed a direct interaction between CHD5 and PDX1, similar to the previously observed CHD4-PDX1 interaction. Immunofluorescence and RNA sequencing showed that CHD5 expression was upregulated in CHD4 knockout mice, indicat- ing a compensatory response (p< 0.05, n=3). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed successful knockout of CHD5 specifically in beta cells (n=3). Glucose tolerance tests revealed significant glu- cose intolerance in both male and female mice (p< 0.05, n=5). Protein analysis of pancreata showed a pronounced downregulation of insulin (p< 0.05), MAFA (p< 0.05), Urocortin 3 (p< 0.05), and Chromogranin A and B (p< 0.05), while PDX1 protein levels remained unchanged (n=3). These findings under- score a critical role for CHD5 in maintaining beta cell function and regulating key proteins crucial for insulin production and secretion.

**Conclusion:**
Our study highlights CHD5 as a critical component of beta cell functionality. The absence of CHD5 leads to beta cell dys- function, characterized by impaired glucose tolerance and reduced expression of essential beta cell proteins. Although PDX1 levels remained unchanged, the reduction in other beta cell markers sug- gests CHD5 may influence downstream gene regulation and chro- matin accessibility. Future studies will explore the broader role of CHD5 in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, and its potential relevance to human beta cell biology and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis.

**Multi-model investigation of pancreatic islet architecture and molecular fingerprint in Hnf1a mice**

U. Larsen, L. Ghila, S. Chera

**Background and aims:**
HNF1A-MODY, the most common form of monogenic diabetes, is caused by specific mutations in Hnf1a, a tran- scription factor essential for pancreatic β-cell development and func- tion. While some Hnf1a mutations are well-established as drivers of diabetes, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain underexplored. Conventional mouse models often fail to accurately mimic the human phenotype due to species-specific differences in islet architecture and gene regulation.To address this, we previously developed two complementary mouse models: (1) humanized condition (in which mouse exon4 of was replaced with its human coun- terpart) constitutively expressing humanized version, and upon cre- recombination expressing the mutant exon4 allele, at endogenous levels under the control of the endogenous regulatory elements in all cells of the body; (2) a conditional knock-out HNF1α (exon4) mouse allowing a timed and cell-type specific HNF1α truncation, hence granting the possibility of studying its specific effects on a certain cell type without the interference of other affected organs or cell populations. Using the Cre/loxP system under the control of the endocrine marker , we selectively targeted the islet endocrine lineages, thus excluding the systemic involvement characterizing the models with full body muta- tion. This approach allowed us to investigate the differential impact of mouse Hnf1a, humanized Hnf1a, and mutant humanized Hnf1a on transcriptional regulation, islet architecture, and β-cell function.

**Materials and methods:**
Over 10 mice from Ngn3cre; HNF1A (exon4- floxed; human-exon4; humP291fsinC-exon4) were analyzed to deter- mine glucose homeostasis and islet morphology by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IpGTT), glycemia measurements, and immu- nofluorescence. Transcriptomic profiling was performed to identify molecular alterations associated with mouse and humanized Hnf1a dys- function, and pathway analysis was used to predict downstream effects.

**Results:**
Immunofluorescence analyses revealed altered endocrine cell composition in the mouse HNF1A model, with an increased propor- tion of glucagon-expressing alpha-cells and reduced insulin-expressing beta-cells compared to controls. For the humanized HNF1A model, the alpha and beta-cell population was instead dynamically affected compared to control mimicking human phenotype. Notably, mutant humanized HNF1A islets did not exhibit significantly higher dys- regulation than the wild-type humanized model. Transcriptomic data indicated metabolic dysregulation in the mutant humanized knock-in model, including downregulation of glucagon and , compensatory mechanisms in glucose transporters and calcium channels.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that Hnf1a dysfunction leads to dynamic endocrine cell remodeling in pancreatic islets, with distinct regulatory differences between mouse and humanized Hnf1a. These results highlight the importance of species-specific factors in MODY pathogenesis and the need for humanized models to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying HNF1A-MODY.

**Background and aims:**
Development, maturation, and function of β-cells requires appropriate transcription of specific gene programs. Transcriptional coregulators, such as the Mediator complex (MED), partner with transcription factors to regulate gene transcription. Mediator subunit MED15 plays important roles in lipid and glucose metabolism across species, suggesting it may be a conserved metabolic regulator. Moreover, we showed that Med15 is required for post-natal maturation of β-cells. However, whether Med15 continues to play a role in β-cell function after maturation is complete is unknown.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate the role of Med15 in β-cells post-maturation, we used male and female knockout (KO; ­Med15 ; Pdx1-Cre ) and control ­(Med15 ; +/+) mice on a C57BLJ back- ground. KO was induced by tamoxifen administration at six weeks age. Mice were assessed for glucose tolerance by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests two weeks after KO (n=8-12). Pancreata were embed- ded in paraffin for immunofluorescence staining and imaged with con- focal microscopy. Islets were isolated for dynamic perifusion to assess insulin secretion (n=2-4) and global transcriptomes were assessed with bulk RNA-sequencing of isolated islets (n=3-5).

**Results:**
Two weeks after Med15 deletion, KO mice developed severe glucose intolerance and elevated fasting glucose levels (AUC p<0.0001 both sexes) despite no changes in insulin-positive or glucagon-positive cell numbers per islet. Insulin secretion was impaired in peri- fusion of KO islets in response to high glucose (AUC; male p<0.01; female p<0.001) and KCl (AUC; male p=0.04; female p=0.023). RNA-seq revealed downregulation of β-cell identity and maturation markers MafA (male p<0.00001 FC=-1.45; female p<0.00001 FC=- 1.06), Ucn3 (p<0.00001 FC=-0.97; female p<0.00001 FC=-1.08), Iapp (p<0.00001 FC=-1.85 female p<0.00001 FC=-2.01), and Slc2a2 (p<0.00001 FC=-1.57 female p<0.00001 FC=-1.86) following KO. Immunofluorescence staining validated downregulation of these mark- ers at a protein level. Gene set enrichment analysis of RNA-seq also showed downregulation of pathways involved in endoplasmic reticulum processes, including the unfolded protein response, stress response, protein processing, and genes required for insulin processing and biosynthesis.

**Conclusion:**
Our results show that loss of Med15 from adult β-cells results in β-cells losing their previously established maturity. Thus, Med15 is required to maintain functional maturity and glucose stimulated insulin secretion in β-cells post-weaning and throughout adulthood.

**Background and aims:**
β-cell compensation in response to metabolic challenges are accompanied by regulation of insulin expression both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play critical roles in regulating protein expression in mecha- nisms including polyadenylation and mRNA stability. Only a few RBPs have been investigated for their role in major β-cell processes such as the production and secretion of insulin. Furthermore, the role of RBPs associated with cytoplasmic polyadenylation, an emerging mechanism affecting mRNA of secreted proteins, remain poorly understood.

**Materials and methods:**
RNAi screening was performed in INS-1E cells to identify regulators of insulin secretion and production. Tran- scriptional regulation of RBPs was examined from islet RNAseq data- sets in pre-clinical animal models ­(Lep , high-fat diet and ­Ins2 ) and INS-1E cells challenged with anisomycin (ribosome collisions) and tunicamycin (ER stress). A doxycycline-inducible system was developed to perform gain-of-function studies of Tent5a in Ins-1E cells. Full-length mRNA sequencing (FLAM-Seq) identified changes in poly(A) tail length, short-read RNA-seq identified differentially expressed genes and immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry identified interaction partners.

**Results:**
Tent5a, a cytoplasmic polyadenylase, emerged as a positive regulator of insulin production. Its expression in islets is positively correlated with normoglycemic obese animal models exhibiting com- pensated β-cell function while negatively correlated in diabetic models of β-cell failure. Ribosome collisions were an early trigger for Tent5a induction, while ER stress and lipotoxic inflammation decreased its expression. Four-fold increase in Tent5a expression elongated the poly(A) tail length of Ins1 and Ins2 from ~100 bp to 154 and 168 bp, respectively (p<0.001), consistent with an increase in mRNA half- life from 26.4 and 23.7 hr to 67.2 and 46.8 hr, respectively (p≤0.01) and a 34% increase in cellular insulin content (p<0.001). Addition- ally, Tent5a activity enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function by upregulating chaperones Pdia4 and Pdia6 expression. Polyadenyla- tion activity and secondary effects on ER function were dependent on Tent5a tethering to the ER membrane through an interaction with the ER transmembrane protein Fndc3b.

**Conclusion:**
These data identified a mechanism by which Tent5a activ- ity increases insulin production while maintaining cellular homeosta- sis and is consistent with its up-regulation in models characteristic of β-cell compensation. Moreover, this work reveals a novel paradigm in which cytoplasmic polyadenylation governs cellular function during metabolic stress.

**Background and aims:**
Increasing evidence highlight the role of miR- NAs in beta cell function, however, the impact of their post-transcrip- tional modifications (isomiRs) remains poorly understood. IsomiRs can arise from nucleotide trimming or extension at the 3’/5’ ends or from nucleotide variations of miRNAs. Inflammation may influence the expression of enzymes involved in isomiR biogenesis, potentially link- ing these molecules to inflammatory processes in beta cells observed in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). This study aims to investigate the relationship between islet inflammation and isomiR expression profiles.

**Materials and methods:**
Three small-RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed to explore the association between proinflammatory stress and isomiR expression: (I) Human islets (n=3), untreated and treated for 48h with IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ; (II) Human islets (n=10), untreated and treated for 24h with IL-1β and IFN-γ; (III) EndoC-βH3 beta-cell line (n=5), untreated and treated for 8h, 24h, and 48h with IL-1β, TNF- α, and IFN-γ, or IFN-α alone. IsomiRs and canonical miRNAs were quantified, and differential proportion analysis was performed to assess changes in proportions across different isomiR classes in response to inflammation. Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA) was con- ducted on TargetScan predicted targets of 3’ trimmed isomiRs. RNA sequencing of cytokine-treated human islets for 24h identified differ- ential expression of 5 exoribonucleases, and RT-PCR was performed on EndoC-βH3 cells after 48h treatment to quantify their expression.

**Results:**
Differential proportion analysis revealed significant (FDR<0.05) 3’ end trimming of miRNAs in all datasets after cytokine treatment. In human islets, 31 and 61 miRNAs at 24 and 48 hours showed increased 3’Trim proportions under inflammation. In EndoC-βH3 cells, 45 miRNAs showed increased 3’Trim at 48 hours, with no significant effects at 8 or 24 hours and mild effects with IFN-α treatment. GOEA showed regulation of immune-related and inflammatory pathways, linked to trimmed miRNAs such as miR- 23a and miR-149-5p, which are already associated with pancreatic islet inflammation. Among the exoribonucleases tested, ISG20 was the most significantly upregulated after cytokine treatment and showed the strongest correlation with 3’Trim proportions, suggesting its role in regulating this process.

**Conclusion:**
These findings highlight that miRNAs undergo consistent 3’ trimming during inflammation in human islets and beta-cell lines, indicating a conserved trimming mechanism in T1D. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind this process may provide insights into islet inflammation and potential therapeutic targets, especially con- sidering the different affinities of 3’ trimmed isomiRs for their targets.

**Deletion of beta cell-specific microRNA-33 improves islet function in mice fed with normal chow or high fat diet**

R. Ortega

**Background and aims:**
We reported increased beta cell mass, insulin content and insulin secretory response in human islets following miR- 33 inhibition; and in islets isolated from global miR-33 knockout (miR- 33 ) mice. However, miR-33 mice are susceptible to diet-induced obesity and develop glucose-intolerance and insulin resistance when fed a high fat diet (HFD). This study investigates the effect of beta cell-specific deletion of miR-33 (miR-33 ) on glucose homeosta- sis, beta cell mass and function in mice maintained on a normal chow or HFD.

**Materials and methods:**
The metabolic phenotype of miR- 33 mice was analysed using glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Plasma insulin levels were measured by ELISA and insulin secretion from islets was quantified by perifusion and radioimmunoassay. Beta cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by insulin and Ki67 immunostaining and detection of caspase 3/7 activities. The same methodology was employed to analyse the effect of miR-33 deletion in miR-33 mice fed with HFD for 8 and 15 weeks.

**Results:**
No changes in body weight were detected between miR- 33 and wild-type (WT) mice at 10 months under chow (AUC, miR-33 vs WT; 1,532±27.7 vs 1,515±20.6, n=54-63, P=0.71) or at 15 weeks under HFD (499.8±13.3 vs 448.9±28.9; n=5-6, P=0.21). Glucose tolerance was not significantly different between miR-33 and WT mice at 2 (AUC; 1,732±125 vs 1,734±146; n=24-30; P=0.98), 4 (1,690±109 vs 1,825±154; n=15; P=0.27), 6 (2,478±201 vs 2,351±231, n=6-10; P=0.71), 8 (3,869±270 vs 4,008±142, n=2-4; P=0.79) and 10 months (2,260±137 vs 2,051±128; n=6-8, P=0.69). However, following HFD feeding for 8 weeks, miR- 33 mice exhibited better glucose handling (AUC: 2,737±243.7 vs 3,589±176, n=4-5, P=0.02), although this benefit was diminished after 15 weeks of HFD feeding. Insulin tolerance was unchanged in chow-fed miR-33 mice (AUC at 8 months; 359±28 vs 357±15, n=2-4; P=0.98) and miR-33 mice under HFD feeding (AUC fol- lowing 8-weeks HFD: 531.5±44.7 vs 501.9±56.4, n=5-6; P=0.96, 15-weeks: 585±63.2 vs 509.8±52.0; n=5-6; P=0.69). Basal plasma insulin levels were similar between miR-33 mice and WT (pM: 111±21.5 vs 120.2±30.0, n=6-8, P=0.80). In 2-6 month-old chow-fed miR-33 mice there were increases in carbachol-induced insulin secretion (AUC: 155.1±16.1 vs 112.5±4.6, n=9-10, P=0.03), beta cell proliferation (ki67+ beta cells: 0.3±0.1 vs 0.0±0.0, n=87-120 islets, P=0.001), beta cell number (149.2±32.3 vs 69.7±8.2, n=45-46 islets, P=0.02) and islet mass (μm : 7,476±1,040 vs 4,358±502, n=88-118 islets, P=0.02), whereas cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis was reduced (luminescence units: 2,827±230.7 vs 3,649±296.1, n=15-17, P=0.01). MiR-33 mice fed with HFD showed increased insulin secretion in response to carbachol (9.8±0.0pg/islet/min vs 5.9±0.0 at T=42 min and 8.1±0.0 vs 5.3±0.0 at T=46 min, n=4-7, P= 0.04 and 0.03, respectively) and reduced beta cell apoptosis (4,760±414.5 vs 6,473±331.9, n=3-4, P=0.02).

**Conclusion:**
Beta cell deletion of miR-33 improves insulin secretion and beta cell mass without affecting body weight, glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. MiR-33 mice presented improved glucose homeostasis, increased insulin secretion and reduced beta cell apop- tosis when fed an HFD. These results suggest that targeting miR-33 specifically in islets could be a promising strategy to improve beta cell function in diabetes.

3. ogy, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands, Inserm

**Background and aims:**
While the human genome encodes ~20,000 protein-coding genes, thousands of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) also contribute to cell functions, often through non-canon- ical translation events. Indeed, microproteins derived from lincRNAs can regulate key metabolic pathways, but their roles in Β cells remain poorly understood. Our goal was to identify and characterize a micro- protein derived from a pancreatic Β cell-enriched lincRNA and to assess its impact on insulin secretion.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed computational analyses to identify human Β cell-enriched lincRNAs and screened their sequences for potential open reading frames (ORFs). Candidate ORFs were then assessed for active translation using both transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and translatomic (Ribo-seq) analysis in the human pancreatic Β-cell model EndoC-ΒH5. To confirm its translation, FLAG-tagged constructs were overexpressed in EndoC-ΒH1 cells, followed by western blot detection. A start codon variant of the candidate ORF (ATG ATT; called null mutant) was generated to assess ORF functionality. Structural predic- tion of the discovered new microprotein was performed in silico, and cellular localization was assessed by immunofluorescence in human EndoC-ΒH1 and HEK293 cells. Finally, we assessed its effect on glu- cose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).

**Results:**
Computational analysis coupled to multi-omics (RNA-seq and Ribo-Seq) led to the identification of a human pancreatic Β cell- enriched lincRNA harboring a 234 nt-long ORF, potentially encoding a 78-amino-acid microprotein. When we overexpressed the wild-type lincRNA in EndoC-ΒH1 cells, this led to the production of a ~15 kDa microprotein, while the null mutant abolished translation, confirm- ing ORF functionality. Structural predictions revealed a disordered N-terminal region, likely mediating protein-protein interactions, and a structured C-terminal domain containing three Β-sheets and two Β-helices, suggesting a role as an allosteric regulator. We next showed that the microprotein was enriched both in the cytoplasm and nucleus in EndoC-ΒH1 cells, whereas exclusively cytoplasmic in HEK293 cells, indicating a potential Β cell-specific nuclear function. The over- expression of the wild-type lincRNA significantly reduced GSIS from EndoC-ΒH1 cells, while the null mutant had no effect, highlighting a direct role of the microprotein in insulin secretion.

**Conclusion:**
We identified a previously unrecognized Β cell-enriched microprotein that negatively regulates insulin secretion, providing new insights into post-transcriptional regulation in Β cells. These findings highlight an untapped reservoir of regulatory microproteins, with potential implications for type 2 diabetes pathophysiology and thera- peutic targeting.

3. China, Innovation Center of Medical Basic Research for Brain Aging

**Background and aims:**
The mitochondrial 3243A > G mutation (m.3243A > G) in the ­tRNA gene is among the most common mitochondrial mutations, leading to various clinical manifestations, especially neurological disorders. However, effective models are still lacking. Here we established the deficient ) that replicates the neural phenotypes observed in m.3243A>G patients.

**Materials and methods:**
RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knock down the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase gene ( ) in to establish an model. Urine-derived stem cells (USCs) with high heteroplasmy levels (Mut-H) were iso- lated from patients with the m.3243A > G mutation for comparative analysis with the model. Acid northern blotting analysis was used to analyze ­tRNA (UUR) charging level in Mut-H USCs and RNAi . Furthermore, we evaluated neural and muscle functions including pharyngeal pumping, locomotion, and mechanosensation in worms.

**Results:**
­tRNA (UUR) charging levels were decreased in both Mut-H USCs and RNAi . In RNAi , an increased proportion of fused or fragmented mitochondria was observed in muscle cells, consistent with the mitochondrial changes observed in Mut-H USCs. Knockdown of significantly reduced the pharyngeal pumping rates, thrashing speeds, and gentle touch responsiveness in the posterior body region of , highlighting the detrimental effects of deficiency on mitochondrial function and neuromuscular behavior.

**Conclusion:**
We stablished RNAi-deficient as a whole-organism model for the m.3243A > G mutation, providing a valuable tool for understanding the mechanisms underlying neurologi- cal and muscular impairments.

**A continuous oxidative phosphorylation is needed to enable depo- larisation-induced insulin secretion**

C. Tappe

**Background and aims:**
The increase of the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio by glucose-driven oxidative phosphorylation is generally regarded as the signal which conveys the state of the energy metabolism to the electrical events which initiate the exocytosis of the insulin granules. The fusion of secretion-ready granules is triggered by ­Ca influx via voltage-dependent ­Ca channels. Here, we tested the energy depend- ence of this late step of insulin secretion by eliciting ­Ca influx with a high extracellular ­K concentration and concurrently inhibiting the mitochondrial ATP synthesis with the specific inhibitor of the mito- chondrial F0 ATPase, oligomycin.

**Materials and methods:**
After collagenase digestion of pancreata from female NMRI-mice, islets were hand-picked under the stereomicro- scope and used either freshly isolated or after culture for 24 hours in RPMI with 10% FBS (5 mM glucose). Insulin secretion was measured by perifusion and ELISA of the fractionated efflux. ATP and ADP were measured by the luciferase method. The cytosolic ­Ca concen- tration ­([Ca ] ) was measured by live cell imaging, using Fura-2, the membrane potential was measured by patch-clamping (perforated patch configuration, current clamp mode).

**Results:**
The islets were perifused with Krebs-Ringer medium (5 mM Glucose). 40 mM KCl was used to stimulate insulin secretion. Oligomycin was added at 4 μg/ml 20 min prior to the KCl stimulus. Irrespective of the use of fresh or cultured islets, the stimulation of secretion was virtually suppressed. This was also true for fresh islets when the exposure time was only 10 or even 5 min, whereas cultured islets showed a moderate reduction of the initial phase, but a growing degree of inhibition with time. From these experiments the half-time of reduction of releasable insulin was calculated to be 1.6 min. At 0.4 μg/ml, 20 min of prior exposure to oligomycin was needed to achieve significant reductions. At 4 μg/ml the 20 min exposure led to an ATP/ ADP ratio of about 1, both in fresh and in cultured islets. The 5 min exposure, however, reduced the ATP/ADP ratio of cultured islets less than the one of fresh islets. The perifusion with oligomycin slowly increased ­[Ca ] which could not be inhibited by D600 or lanthanum. The slow increase did not diminish the peak ­[Ca ] values elicited by the subsequent perifusion with 40 mM KCl. Correspondingly, oligo- mycin did not affect the resting membrane potential nor diminished it the depolarizing effect of 40 mM KCl. The depolarization by 25 mM glucose in contrast was reversed within 3 min.

**Conclusion:**
Even a strong depolarization, which produces initial rates of insulin secretion beyond the extent produced by glucose stimulation, is virtually unable to elicit a secretory response when the ATP genera- tion by oxidative phosphorylation is rapidly inhibited. Apparently, a continuous ATP supply is needed for the secretion-ready granules to sustain their ability to react to a ­Ca increase in their vicinity.

**Implication of spermine oxidase in pancreatic beta cell function**

L. Nocquet

**Background and aims:**
The global prevalence of diabetes is stead- ily increasing. Type 2 diabetes (T2D), the most prevalent form of the disease, arises from dysfunction and/or loss of insulin-producing β-cells, resulting in hyperglycemia and associated complications such as cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Despite signif- icant research, the molecular mechanisms driving this complex disease remain incomplete. Our study aimed to better understand the metabolic pathways regulating pancreatic islet function.

**Materials and methods:**
We first identified a potential metabolic actor in islets of T2D patients using the RNA-seq biobank in our research center. To explore its role in β-cell function, its expression was silenced using siRNAs in rat INS-1 832/13 cells and human islets. Insulin secre- tion was measured using commercially available ELISA assay kits, and metabolic function was evaluated by respirometry (Seahorse extracel- lular flux analysis).

**Results:**
We identified elevated mRNA expression of spermine oxi- dase (SMOX) in pancreatic islets of T2D patients (+42%, p<0.01), which positively correlated with insulin expression and negatively with glucagon expression. SMOX catalyzes oxidation of the poly- amine spermine to spermidine. Polyamine metabolism is crucial for β-cell function. Nevertheless, the specific role of SMOX in β-cells is poorly understood. We found that silencing of reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in both of our models (INS-1 832/13 cells: -72%, p<0.01; human islets: -63%, p<0.01). In INS-1 832/13 cells, silencing also impaired insulin secretion induced by other stimuli, such as pyruvate (a metabolic fuel, -70%), to a lesser extent, KCl (a depolarizing agent that induces insulin exocy- tosis, -38%) and IBMX (which increases intracellular cAMP levels and stimulates insulin granule exocytosis, -35%). In the same model, we observed that silencing reduced intracellular insulin con- tent by 52% (p<0.001). This decrease in total insulin was associated with a 37% reduction in its mRNA levels (p<0.001). Moreover, in INS-1 832/13 cells, we found that silencing led to a fourfold decrease in glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption, indicating that the SMOX protein also plays a role in regulating mitochon- drial metabolism in insulin-secreting cells. Finally, INS-1 832/13 cells exposure to high glucose (16.7 mM) and palmitate (0.4 mM), which creates a glucolipotoxic environment mimicking the patho- genic conditions encountered by β-cells in T2D, led to an increase in mRNA expression by 36%, 43%, and 60% after 24, 48, and 72 hours of treatment, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Our study shows that SMOX is involved in regulation of insulin secretion in a clonal rat model and in human islets. Our results suggest that SMOX upregulation in T2D may be a compen- satory mechanism to maintain insulin output under metabolic stress. This effect could result from modulations of both insulin production and mitochondrial metabolism. Interestingly, polyamines have been implicated in oxidative stress, which is known to influence both insulin synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism. Therefore, oxidative stress in this process requires further investigation. A better characterization of SMOX’s impact on β-cell function could contribute to novel thera- peutic strategies for T2D.

**Targeting miR-125b in beta cells: Novel approaches to modulate lysosomal dynamics and lysosomal-dependent processes**

M.W. Paszek

**Background and aims:**
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and are vital for pancreatic β-cell function. Our group has shown that glucose-dependent miR-125b impairs the insulin secretory function of β-cells and identified the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR), a transporter of lysosomal hydrolases, as a down- stream target. Mice conditionally overexpressing miR-125b in β-cells (miR125b-Tg) exhibited enlarged lysosomal structures and reduced Cathepsin D content, a lysosomal hydrolase that utilises the M6PR pathway. We hypothesise that miR-125b disrupts lysosomal function by targeting M6PR and that selective inhibition of this miRNA in β-cells could improve their function and glycaemic control. This study inves- tigates miR-125b’s effect on lysosomal function via M6PR in mouse islets and explores whether these effects are conserved in humans. We also establish strategies to counteract miR-125b’s effects and .

**Materials and methods:**
MiR-125b’s impact on M6PR expression and autophagy was assessed by Western blotting (WB) in islets from miR125b-Tg mice. MiR-125b inhibitors and target-site blockers (TSBs) acting on M6PR were used in MIN6 cells, with target expression evaluated by RT-qPCR and WB. Lysosomal Cathepsin D content and morphology were measured by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively, in EndoC-βH3 and MIN6 cells with siRNA-mediated M6PR knockdown. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was quantified using an insulin HTRF assay.

**Results:**
Short-term miR-125b overexpression (48 h) in miR125b-Tg islets reduced M6PR levels (0.79-fold, p < 0.05, n = 3) but did not affect autophagic flux. In contrast, lifelong overexpression increased p62 and LC3-II levels (1.30 and 1.59-fold, respectively, p < 0.05, n = 4), indicative of a block in the lysosomal degradation pathway. MiR125b-Tg islets remained responsive to the autophagy modulators chloroquine and rapamycin, suggesting that lysosomal dysfunction— rather than impaired autophagy initiation—underlies miR-125b’s effects. We are validating these results via microscopy using islets from miR125b-Tg mice expressing the genetic RFP-EGFP-LC3 autophagy reporter. M6PR knockdown in EndoC-βH3 (0.36-fold, p < 0.05, n = 4) reduced lysosomal Cathepsin D content (0.63-fold, p < 0.005, n = 6) and impaired GSIS (0.79-fold, p < 0.05, n = 4), while insulin content remained unchanged. In MIN6 cells, M6PR knockdown (0.5-fold, p < 0.01, n = 6) caused the accumulation of enlarged lysosomal structures. Collectively, these effects mirrored those observed in miR125b-Tg mice. In MIN6 cells, miR-125b overexpression downregulated M6PR levels (0.62-fold, p < 0.005, n = 4). Treatment with a miR-125b inhibi- tor or a TSB targeting miR-125b’s binding site on ’s mRNA preserved M6PR levels following miR-125b overexpression (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively). We will use the TSB to determine M6PR’s contribution to miR-125b function and assess the effects of these agents on glycaemic outcomes in mice using a β-cell-specific delivery approach.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest M6PR as a downstream effector of miR-125b in regulating lysosomal function and insulin secretion. We also lay the groundwork for exploring miR-125b modulation as a therapeutic approach. Ongoing research will further elucidate M6PR’s role in lysosomal dynamics and β-cell function.

**Functional alpha cell heterogeneity: insights from mice to humans**

J.K. Panzer

**Background and aims:**
Alpha cells are essential regulators of glucose homeostasis, secreting glucagon to counteract hypoglycemia. Emerging evidence suggests that alpha cells are heterogeneous, with distinct sub- populations exhibiting differences in gene expression, hormone secre- tion, and calcium signaling. This diversity implies specialized roles in metabolic regulation, yet the mechanisms governing alpha cell function and glucagon secretion remain poorly understood. In particular, the interplay between alpha cells and neighboring beta and delta cells is crucial for maintaining islet homeostasis, and its disruption contrib- utes to dysregulated glucose control in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).This study aims to define the functional subpopulations of alpha cells and investigate how paracrine signals from beta and delta cells influence glucagon secretion. Understanding these mechanisms will provide criti- cal insights into islet biology and identify potential therapeutic targets for restoring glucose regulation in T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
We initially utilized a mouse model in which alpha cells express the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3, enabling visualization of calcium dynamics across the entire alpha cell population. We now started to extend these studies to human samples using both isolated islets and pancreatic tissue slices from non-diabetic donors and donors with T1D. We assess alpha cell function under three primary conditions: (a) varying glycemic levels, (b) application of ago- nists and antagonists targeting autocrine and paracrine pathways, and (c) stimulation with reference agents such as adrenaline and KCl. Func- tional outcomes are measured using dynamic hormone secretion assays and real-time calcium imaging to evaluate cellular activity.

**Results:**
Our functional studies reveal significant alpha cell heterogene- ity. In mice, where we could visualize the entire alpha cell population, we found that only ~30% of alpha cells respond to glucose changes. Furthermore, we identified three distinct subpopulations: (1) cells that respond to a decrease in glucose concentration, (2) cells that do not respond to glucose at all, and (3) cells that exhibit pulsatile activity independent of glucose levels. Expanding these findings to human islets, we observed similar subpopulations in glucose responses, con- firming the conserved nature of alpha cell heterogeneity. Additionally, we identified subpopulations of alpha cells that could be activated by removing inhibitory signals from beta and delta cells, but even these populations exhibited distinct functional characteristics. Calcium imag- ing and hormone secretion studies further highlighted this heterogene- ity. Specifically, blocking serotonin signaling with a 5-HT1F receptor antagonist nearly doubled glucagon secretion in low glucose, while blocking somatostatin signaling with cyclosomatostatin increased glucagon secretion by ~50%.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings provide strong evidence for functional het- erogeneity among alpha cells, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting differential responses to glucose and paracrine regulation. The presence of alpha cell subpopulations that can be selectively activated by remov- ing inhibitory signals suggests that alpha cell dysfunction in T1D may be restricted to specific subgroups rather than being a uniform defect. Understanding these subpopulations is crucial, as it may enable tar- geted therapeutic approaches to restore glucagon secretion and improve glucose regulation in T1D.

**Role of Stac2 adaptor protein on membrane excitability and hor- mone secretion of endocrine cells**

L.E. Häfele

**Background and aims:**
Stac adaptor proteins (Stac1-Stac3) have been identified as novel regulators of L-type voltage gated ­Ca channel ­(Ca ) expression and biophysical properties. Functionally, it has only been shown in heterologous cell systems or cultured hippocampal neu- rons that Stac2 overexpression abolishes L-type ­Ca channel voltage- dependent inactivation. Here we set to investigate if genetic ablation of the endogenous Stac2 protein alters mouse chromaffin cells (MCCs) or pancreatic β-cells ­Ca channels biophysical properties, membrane excitability, and hormone release.

**Materials and methods:**
For this we used a combination of voltage- clamp, current-clamp, capacitance measurements, and glucose-induced dynamic insulin release.

**Results:**
In MCCs, Stac2 deletion did not alter whole-cell calcium currents amplitude or inactivation kinetics but significantly shifted the voltage-dependence of activation to more hyperpolarized poten- tials. ­Stac2 MCCs did not show altered resting membrane poten- tial or spontaneous action potential (AP) firing frequency. However, the AP depolarization threshold was significantly reduced and step current injection elicited APs with higher initial firing frequency in ­Stac2 compared to WT. Interestingly, Stac2 deletion impaired the time course of MCCs vesicle exocytosis. In pancreatic β-cells, Stac2 deletion caused a significant increase in glucose-induced membrane depolarization. While the AP-train duration and frequency were not affected, the AP threshold was significantly higher in ­Stac2 compared to WT. Contrary to increased excitability, 15 mM glucose stimulation showed an almost complete loss of first-phase insulin release albeit only a trend towards reduced total insulin release.

**Conclusion:**
Cumulative we show that Stac2 is an important regula- tor of endocrine MCCs and β-cell excitability and vesicle exocytosis.

**Insulinotropic nutrient stimuli depolarise single beta cells but not single alpha cells**

M. Parambath

**Background and aims:**
Like beta-cells, pancreatic alpha-cells express glucokinase and ­K channels. However, the increase of glucose inhibits glucagon secretion. It is unclear whether the secretion is regu- lated by alpha-cell intrinsic mechanisms and whether signal recogni- tion by mitochondria plays a role in it. Recently, we observed that in contrast to beta-cells, alpha-cells show only a modest increase in the ATP/ADP ratio in response to glucose and no increase at all in response to alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) or glutamine plus BCH.

**Materials and methods:**
Islets from NMRI mice were isolated and dispersed into single beta- and alpha-cells. The membrane potential of the single cells was measured using the perforated patch technique. Fluo4 AM was employed to assess the cytosolic calcium concentration of single cells while they were perfused on the stage of a patch-clamp microscope. In addition to the cellular capacitance the beta- and alpha- cell identity was checked by immunofluorescence after the experiment.

**Results:**
In the presence of 1 mM glucose single beta-cells had a mem- brane potential of -61mV and reacted within 10 min to stimulation with either 30 mM glucose, 10 mM alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) or glutamine plus BCH (10 mM each) with a depolarization by 28 mV, 21 mV or 14mV, respectively. The depolarization by glutamine plus BCH was much slower than the depolarization by glucose or KIC, so the maximal value was only attained during wash-out and may thus be underestimated. The reaction of the alpha-cells was much more heterogeneous. When only those alpha-cells which responded to argi- nine and stained positive for glucagon were included in the evalua- tion, the following picture emerges: The membrane potential at 1 mM glucose was very noisy and was about -49 mV. The reaction to glu- cose, KIC or glutamine plus BCH led to a depolarisation of 3 mV, 8 mV and 4 mV, respectively. The modest depolarizing effect of KIC on the alpha-cells, which was the only significant effect, was virtually complete after 2 min, the same time as required by the ­K -blocking sulfonylurea tolbutamide to depolarize the alpha-cells by ca. 15 mV. Thus, the depolarization by KIC is likely due to its direct effect on the ­K channels rather than on its effect on the mitochondrial ATP synthesis. The modest depolarizing effect of KIC on alpha-cells was reflected by a much lower increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration than in beta-cells.

**Conclusion:**
Insulinotropic nutrient secretagogues depolarize beta- cells with kinetics which reflect their effect on the mitochondrial oxi- dative phosphorylation. At the best modest effect of these compounds on the membrane potential of alpha-cells fits to their virtual inefficiency to raise the ATP/ADP ratio in these cells. Alpha-cell-intrinsic rec- ognition of nutrients, if existent at all, does not rely on the oxidative phosphorylation.

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic adipose tissue (PAT) has been associated with impaired insulin secretion in individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the mechanisms through which PAT negatively affects pancreatic beta cells remain unclear. This study aims to explore the functional interaction between human pancreatic adipocytes and islets using an in vitro co-culture model.

**Materials and methods:**
Pancreatic stromal vascular fractions isolated from peripancreatic fat biopsies of non-diabetic (ND) and T2D patients (n=3-8) were differentiated to generate PAT organoids. These organoids were co-cultured for 72h with human microislets derived from ND donors. In an alternative approach, EndoC-BH5 (human beta cell line) spheroids were exposed to the secretome of ND-PAT orga- noids for 72h. The measured outcomes included glucose- and incretin- dependent insulin secretion, PAT adipogenesis (RT-PCR) and lipolysis (free fatty acid release).

**Results:**
In comparison to ND-PAT organoids, T2D-organoids showed impaired adipogenesis (significantly lower levels of relative mRNA of PPARG: 0.2±0.04 vs 0.34±0.08 and ADIPOQ: 0.65±0.11 vs 1.006±0.2), increased isoproterenol-induced lipolysis (84.5±22.09 vs 25.8±4.7 nmol FFA/mg protein) and worsened insulin resistance (insulin-mediated inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis: 64 % in ND vs 29 % in T2D). The effects of PAT organoids on cocultured human microislets varied by donor’s metabolic background. Thus, ND- PAT organoids enhanced insulin secretion in response to exendin-4, GIP and tirzepatide (monoculture: 7.1±0.7, 8.5±0.7, 7.5±0.4; cocul- ture: 12.6±2.1, 12.1±0.9; 10.9±0.9 % of content, respectively), while T2D-PAT organoids impaired glucose (monoculture: 0.7±2.1 vs 6.32±0.9; coculture: 2.97±0.6 vs 10.7±3.4 % of content, respec- tively) and exendin-4/GIP-stimulated insulin secretion (monocul- ture: 7.06±0.9, 9.7±0.9; coculture: 8.5±1.87; 8.6±0.9 % of content, respectively). Coculture with human microislets did not affect insulin sensitivity of ND-PAT organoids, but exacerbated insulin resistance of T2D-PAT organoids (insulin-mediated inhibition of isoprotere- nol-stimulated lipolysis: 29% in monocultured vs 15% in cocultured organoids). In EndoC-BH5 spheroids, GSIS and incretin-augmented GSIS were significantly reduced upon inhibition of Gq (YM254890) and of beta-arrestins (barbadin). Exposure of EndoC-BH5 cells to the secretome of ND-PAT organoids restored GSIS in the presence of beta-arrestin inhibition and enhanced exendin-4 and GIP-augmented insulin secretion in a Gq/beta-arrestin independent and dependent man- ner, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
PAT has divergent effects on beta cells, promoting glu- cose- and incretin-augmented insulin secretion in ND individuals while triggering dysfunctional GSIS in T2D. Our observations suggest that PAT interferes with incretin signalling pathways in beta cells, opening new avenues for modulation of insulin secretion.

2. Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea, Division of Endocrinology and

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic surgery is a common treatment for both benign and malignant pancreatic diseases. The extent and type of pancreatectomy can significantly influence postoperative pancreatic endocrine function. While total pancreatectomy inevi- tably results in insulin-dependent diabetes, the effects of partial pancreatectomy on residual insulin secretory capacity remain under-investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of dif- ferent type of pancreatectomy on β-cell function, as assessed by serum C-peptide levels.

**Materials and methods:**
The 489 patients who underwent pancre- atic resection at one hospital between January 2010 and Septem- ber 2024 were reviewed. Among these, 193 patients had adequate postoperative C-peptide data (fasting and postprandial) and were included in the analysis. Patients were categorized into two sur- gical groups: the distal group (distal pancreatectomy, Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy, and spleen-preserving distal pan- createctomy, n=81) and the head group (Whipple’s procedure, and pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, n=112). Impaired insulin secretory function was defined as a post-prandial C-peptide level <1.0 ng/mL. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in each group who developed impaired insulin secretion postoperatively. The secondary outcome was the time to C-peptide decline below 1.0 ng/mL after surgery.

**Results:**
Among the 193 patients analyzed, 39 (34.8%) in the head group and 17 (21.0%) in the distal group developed postoperative C-peptide <1.0 ng/mL (p = 0.053). The mean time from surgery to the first C-peptide <1.0 ng/mL was shorter in the head group (52.6 days) compared to the distal group (82.6 days), indicating earlier decline in insulin secretory capacity following head resection. Kaplan-Meier analysis similarly showed a trend toward earlier C-peptide decline in the head group (p = 0.096).

**Conclusion:**
Despite expectations that distal pancreatectomy would impair insulin secretion more due to loss of islet-rich tis- sue, patients undergoing head pancreatectomy showed a higher and earlier incidence of C-peptide decline. These findings suggest that head resection may pose greater risk to β-cell function, under- scoring the need to consider endocrine outcomes during surgical planning. Postoperative C-peptide monitoring could guide early glycemic interventions. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these observations.

**Gabapentin enhances mouse pancreatic beta cell excitability but reduces KCl-induced insulin release without affecting Ca calcium**

R.S. Taguchi

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic β-cell electrical activity and insu- lin secretion are regulated by High Voltage-gated Calcium Channels (HVCC). Previously, we demonstrated that genetic ablation of the α2δ-1 HVCC subunit reduces β-cell calcium influx by ~60%, severely impairing insulin release causing glucose intolerance. The antiepileptic and analgesic gabapentinoids target α2δ subunits and reduce HVCC calcium currents. However, gabapentinoid use has paradoxically been linked to hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia.To explore this discrep- ancy, we investigated whether chronic gabapentin (GBP) treatment affects β-cell glucose-dependent excitability and insulin release in an HVCC-dependent manner.

**Materials and methods:**
Isolated mouse pancreatic islets were incu- bated with 1mM GBP for 36-40 hours. The effects were characterized at single β-cell level using electrophysiology (voltage- and current- clamp), and at whole islet level using calcium imaging and dynamic insulin release.

**Results:**
Half of the GBP-treated islets exhibited spontaneous calcium transients at subthreshold glucose levels (5 mM), unlike untreated islets, which remained silent. In 10 mM glucose, 66% of the GBP- treated islets showed continuous calcium transients instead of rhyth- mic activity. Consistent with increased excitability, GBP-treated β-cells displayed a higher resting membrane potential and plateau potential. However, KCl-induced calcium transients and dynamic insulin release were significantly reduced. Importantly, these effects were not due to decreased β-cell HVCC calcium influx.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that GBP treatment exerts a bipha- sic effect on β-cell function enhancing excitability at low physiologi- cal glucose levels but impairing insulin secretion under maximal stimulation.

**Background and aims:**
The long-chain fatty-acid receptor FFA4 exerts beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis and is considered a potential therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes. We previous showed in mouse islets that FFA4 activation potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion indirectly via inhibition of somatostatin (SST) secre- tion from δ cells. However, the mechanism of action of FFA4 in human islets remains unknown. Here, we investigated the mechanism of FFA4 action in mouse islets and explored the hypothesis that FFA4 agonists directly stimulate insulin secretion in human β cells.

**Materials and methods:**
One-hour static incubations were performed on isolated mouse and human islets exposed to the selective FFA4 agonist CpdA (20 μM). Insulin and SST were assessed by radioim- munoassay. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Significance was tested using two-way ANOVA with post-hoc adjustment for multiple comparisons.

**Results:**
In mouse islets, CpdA potentiated glucose-induced insulin secretion (2.0 ± 0.3 fold increase vs. glucose alone; n=6; p<0.05) and decreased SST secretion (34 ± 5 pM vs. 58 ± 7 pM in glucose alone; n=7; p<0.001). CpdA did not affect insulin secretion in SST-deficient islets (1.1 ± 0.1 fold increase vs. glucose alone; n=9; ns). As we previ- ously showed that FFA4 does not couple to Gα , we asked whether it couples to Gα in δ cells. CpdA reduced SST secretion in wild-type (19 ± 10 pM vs. 64 ± 33 pM in glucose alone; n=8; p<0.0001), but not in knockout (35 ± 23 pM vs. 47 ± 16 pM in glucose alone; n=8; ns) islets. In human islets, in line with the elevated expression of in beta cells, CpdA potentiated insulin secretion (1.8 ± 0.2 fold increase vs. glucose alone; n=3; p>0.05) but had no effect on SST secretion (67 ± 12 pM vs. 74 ± 14 pM in glucose alone; n=4; ns).

**Conclusion:**
Our data suggest distinct mechanisms of action of FFA4 whereby FFA4-Gα coupling indirectly increases insulin secretion via inhibition of SST secretion in rodent’s δ cells, whereas in humans, FFA4 activation in β cells directly increases insulin secretion.

**Characteristics of berberine effects on insulin exocytosis in pan- creatic beta cells**

H. Wang

**Background and aims:**
The Coptis chinensis is widely used in dia- betes therapies in traditional folk medicine from China for thousands of years. We have previously reported that its main active component, berberine (BBR), acts as an insulin secretagogue through inhibition of the KCNH6 potassium channel. However, the specific actions of BBR on insulin secretory granule (ISG) dynamics are largely unknown. The aim of this project is to compare the different effect of short-term and long-term treatment of BBR on ISG docking and fusion with plasma membrane and to explore the mechanisms.

**Materials and methods:**
For short-term treatment of BBR, islets or cells were incubated with a suitable concentration of BBR directly. For long-term treatment of BBR, mice were gavaged with BBR for 8 consecutive weeks. Glucose tolerance test was employed to assess the invivo phenotype of diabetes. Glucose stimulated insulin secretion assay and cytoplasma calcium concentration assay were conducted to evaluate dynamic of insulin secretion. Number of ISG fusion events and number of docked ISG were analyzed by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy respec- tively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to check the levels of cAMP and insulin. The expression of target gene and pathway-related protein was detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting.

**Results:**
Under short-term treatment, at 8.3 mmol/L glucose, BBR slightly induced insulin secretion with a gradually increasing second phase only, showing an increased number of ISGs fused without pre- docking to the plasma membrane. However, in the presence of 16.7 mmol/L glucose, biphasic insulin secretion by BBR was augmented significantly and showed different dynamics from that by 8.3 mmol/L glucose. The intracellular ­Ca level gradually increased during the second phase by BBR at 8.3 mmol/L glucose, which differs from the ­Ca dynamics with rapidly increasing during biphasic phases at 16.7 mmol/L, suggesting that the difference in ­Ca dynamics contributes to the difference in the dynamics of insulin exocytosis. Under long- term BBR treatment for db/db mice, BBR restored impaired biphasic phases of insulin secretion by recovering the number of ISGs fused with or without predocking to the plasma membrane. In addition, BBR enhanced the docking capacity and increased biphasic ­Ca con- centration after glucose stimulation. Further research revealed that the short-term effect of BBR primarily promoted the fusion of ISGs through blocking KCNH6 channels, while the long-term effect of BBR improved the docking and fusion of ISGs by additional effect on acti- vating the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway.

**Conclusion:**
Short-term and long-term treatment of BBR promoted insulin exocytosis through different mechanisms in pancreatic β cells, in which BBR primarily promoted the fusion of ISGs through block- ing KCNH6 channels under short-term effect, while BBR improved the docking and fusion of ISGs by additional effect on activating the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway with long-term effect.

**Background and aims:**
Curcumin is a natural substance that has been reported to reduce plasma glucose concentration and improve glycated haemoglobin levels, likely through direct insulinotropic and cytoprotective effects on beta cells. However, elucidating the role of curcumin in regulating beta cell function is challenging due to its low solubility and poor bioavailability in the body. Nanocarriers have thus emerged as a potential strategy to facilitate curcumin delivery across biological barriers. We previously found that inhibition or deletion of microRNA-33 (miR-33) promotes insulin secretion, increases insulin content, and expands beta cell mass and there is evidence that curcumin regulates miR-33 expression. We have therefore investigated the effects of a curcumin nanoformulation (Nano-CUR) on miR-33 expression and islet function.

**Materials and methods:**
A Nano-CUR and a blank nanoformulation without curcumin (Nano-BLK) were prepared using a modified thin- film hydration method with DSPE-PEG and Pluronic™ F-127 poly- mers. Isolated mouse islets were incubated with vehicle-supplemented RPMI (control), unformulated curcumin (CUR), Nano-BLK or Nano- CUR for 24 hours. Cell viability was assessed by quantification of ATP synthesis and trypan blue staining; miR-33 expression was analysed by qPCR; insulin secretion and content were evaluated via radioimmu- noassay and islet apoptosis was quantified by luminescent measurement of caspase 3/7 activities.

**Results:**
Mouse islets exposed for 24 hours to control, 5μM CUR, 5μM Nano-BLK, or 5μM Nano-CUR showed no significant difference in cell viability (ATP synthesis control vs CUR vs Nano-BLK vs Nano-CUR; 100±10.5 vs 83.7±8.8 vs 92.1±5.8 vs 67.6±10.5; n=6; P=0.91, 0.99, 0.12) or trypan blue uptake. However, treatment with 15μM CUR and 15μM Nano-BLK, but not 15μM Nano-CUR, resulted in decreased islet cell viability (100±10.5 vs 56.6±6.6 vs 59.4±7.4 vs 72.8±2.5, n=6, P=0.01, 0.02 and 0.32). Nano-CUR (5μM) reduced islet miR-33 expression, but CUR and Nano-BLK had no effect on miR-33 levels (miR-33 expression relative to miR-103: 1.0±0.0 vs 0.8±0.1 vs 0.9±0.0 vs 0.5±0.1; n=6 from 3 experiments; P<0.05). The Nano-CUR-induced miR-33 downregulation was associated with enhanced acute insulin secretion in response to 500μM carbachol (% control: 4,221±633% vs 5,402±1,207% vs 6,245±1,307% vs 8,366±1,873%; n=4-10 from 2 experiments; P<0.05) and increased insulin content (106.5±9.6 ng/islet vs 144.7±14.0 vs 107.1±8.6 vs 153.4±10.2; n=24 islets per group from 8 replicates; P<0.05). No significant effects of 5μM Nano- CUR on cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis were observed (caspase 3/7 luminescence: 8,370±1,379 vs 8,391±1,679 vs 3,444±670.0 vs 9,841±950.3; n=7-16 from 3 experiments; P>0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Exposure of mouse islets to Nano-CUR, but not CUR, reduces miR-33 expression without affecting islet cell viability and enhances insulin secretion and content. However, no effect on beta cell apoptosis was observed. These results highlight the potential of Nano-CUR as a therapeutic approach to improve beta cell function in the prevention and treatment of diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Lipotoxicity mediated β-cell death and dys- function by chronic high-fat feeding is the prime cause for progression to Type2 diabetes. Insulin resistance and aberrant glucose metabolism has been positively correlated with the amount of fat in the pancreas. Our recent findings showed that a high amount of intracellular lipid in beta-cells corresponds to decrease in the insulin level and its secretory ability. The present study investigated the potential cytoprotective role of Kaempferol, a natural flavonoid, against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and death.

**Materials and methods:**
Mice were segregated into four groups. Two groups were maintained under standard diet (SD), containing 57.3% carbohydrate, 18.1% protein and 4.5% fat, and another two under high- fat diet (HFD), containing 32.5% lard, 32.5% corn oil, 20% sucrose and 15% protein, for 12 weeks. Kaempferol was administered daily, orally @50 mg/kg b.w./day, to one each batch of SD and HFD groups until the end of the experimental period. GTT, ITT and HOMA-IR data were recorded every 4 weeks. Pancreas was harvested, subjected to H-E and immunohistochemical staining. Islets were isolated for immunoblot- ting, qPCR and flowcytometric analysis. Serum samples were prepared for lipid profiling and evaluation of diabetogenic parameters.

**Results:**
Kaempferol normalized insulin secretion as depicted by serum GSIS, preserved islet mass by inhibiting apoptosis, and reduction of caspase-3 activation in beta-cells without altering any weight gain in HFD mice. Annexin-V-FITC staining from isolated islet cells also cor- roborated with the above results indicating that Kaempferol reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells. Kaempferol prevented downregula- tion of Pdx1 and BETA2 (insulin gene transcriptors), AMPK activity and GLUT2 levels compared to HFD. Anti-apoptotic markers such as p-Akt and Bcl-2 levels also remain unchanged which was otherwise significantly downregulated in HFD animals. A reduction in the mito- chondrial membrane depolarization was also observed in Kaempferol treated group versus HFDs, which has been associated with preserva- tion of islet-mass. Kaempferol reduced the expression of Nrf2, a tran- scription factor induced due to oxidative stress, in β-cells by abrogat- ing intracellular lipid accumulation. Plasma triglyceride, fetuin-A, and pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α) levels were also remained normal as has been in SD group compared to HFD.

**Conclusion:**
Above data evidently established Kaempferol to be a potent candidate to address lipotoxicity-induced insulin secretory dys- function and β-cell death.

**CD36 inhibition by Salvianolic acid B relieves ER stress and pro- tects beta cell function during hyperlipidaemic condition**

N. Das

**Background and aims:**
CD36, a transporter of long chain fatty acids, mediates free fatty acid (FFA) entry and accumulation of lipids in the pancreatic beta cells leading to lipotoxicity. One of the major mecha- nisms that underpins lipotoxic death of beta cells is endoplasmic reticu- lum (ER) stress. Beta cells possess highly elaborated ER and 50% of its protein synthetic load accounts for insulin synthesis. Salvianolic Acid B (SalB), a polyphenolic compound from , has been shown to be an inhibitor of CD36. The aim of this present investiga- tion is to study the effect of SalB in lipid accumulation and beta cell dysfunction with an emphasis on ER stress pathways.

**Materials and methods:**
For studies, MIN6 (Mouse Insu- linoma) and INS1 (Rat Insulinoma) cells were incubated with Palmitate(0.75mM)+FetuinA(100μg/mL) for 24h-48h with or with- out SalB (100μM) pretreatment for 1h. Expression of ER stress mark- ers and other signaling molecules were assessed through immunoblot and qPCR. Intracellular lipid accumulation was observed by BODIPY staining. Immunofluorescence study was performed to observe insulin content within the cells. Beta cell health was examined through Glucose Stimulated Insulin secretion (GSIS). For initial experiments, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a Standard diet (SD) or High fat diet (HFD) for 4-20 weeks. Islets were isolated and immunoblotting was performed for ER stress markers. Evaluating the results, mice were fed SD or HFD for 12 weeks for second set of experiment. Another group of HFD mice was given SalB (25mg/kg b.w., i.p.) for last 4 weeks of treatment. Islets were subjected to immunoblotting and qPCR analysis for lipid accumulation and ER stress markers. Immunostaining for insulin was done in the pan- creatic sections from the treated groups to assess insulin content. Lipid accumulation in the islets were visualized by Nile Red staining. Insulin resistance and secretion were measured by GTT, ITT and in-vivo GSIS.

**Results:**
SalB pretreatment significantly reduced ER stress markers GRP78 (~1.5 fold) and CHOP (~1.4 fold) expression in Palm+FetA treated MIN6 and INS1 cells. In addition, SalB restored PDX1 and GLUT2, while CD36 expression was unchanged. SalB also abrogated Palm+FetA induced intracellular lipid accumulation as observed by BODIPY staining. Both and models reflected that SalB enhanced insulin content and secretion, as demonstrated by immuno- fluorescence and GSIS, respectively. Interestingly, GRP78 was elevated (~3 fold) in mice islets of 8 weeks and 12 weeks HFD group, implying initial adaptive response to ER stress. However, GRP78 expression decreased in later stages, while CHOP levels remained elevated (~1.8 fold) throughout the treatment period compared to SD fed mice. In the second set of experiment, SalB administration in 12 weeks HFD group suppressed ER stress markers as well as lipid accumulation markers (CD36, SREBP1, SCD1, PLIN2 and PLIN5). Confocal imaging further established higher insulin content along with decreased lipid accumu- lation in the islets of HFD+SalB mice compared to HFD-only group. GTT and ITT showed improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitiv- ity in the SalB treated HFD mice.

**Conclusion:**
These results indicate that inhibiting CD36 with SalB effectively alleviates ER stress by suppressing lipid accumulation, which further aids in functional improvement of pancreatic beta cells.

3. Japan, Autophagy Research Center, Juntendo University Graduate

**Background and aims:**
Autophagy is an intracellular protein degradation system essential for maintaining cellular homeo- stasis, and its disturbance in pancreatic beta cells contributes to the progression of type 2 diabetes(T2D). No drugs activating autophagy are available in clinical practice, though improving autophagic dysfunction in pancreatic beta cells could be a prom- ising strategy in treating T2D. We aim to identify a novel seed drug for T2D treatment by activating autophagy in pancreatic beta cells.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed high-throughput screen- ing of a compound library in MIN6 cells expressing pHluorin- LC3-mCherry reporter, with which pHluorin/mCherry fluores- cence ratio decreases in response to an increase in autophagic flux, to determine agents upregulating the autophagic flux. We investigated whether the identified drug could improve disturbed autophagic flux in MIN6 cells under lipotoxicity and its molecu- lar mechanism regulating autophagy. Finally, we examined its effect on glucose intolerance in diabetic model mice for future application in drug development.

**Results:**
Our primary screening in MIN6 cells expressing pHluorin-LC3-mCherry narrowed down 9600 compounds to 108, among which we performed counter-screening with Atg5 KO MIN6 cells and a secondary screening to evaluate dose responses. We identified four compounds to increase the autophagic flux in MIN6 cells and focused on T-068677 based on its structure and physiological aspects. T-068677 showed a beneficial effect on improving autophagic flux in MIN6 cells under lipotoxic- ity (1.62 ± 0.05 vs. 1.29 ± 0.11, pHluorin/mCherry ratio in 24 hours, mean±SEM, p = 0.052). T-068677 showed no inhibition in mTOR activity estimated by p-4E-BP1/4E-BP1 ratio compared to Torin-1, and no reduction in ULK1 phosphorylation estimated by p-ULK1/ULK1 ratio in western blot. Fluorescent protein-tagged Atg9A and DFCP1 showed puncta formation similar to Torin- 1. A whole proteomic analysis in MIN6 cells demonstrated that T-068677 significantly degrades a representative autophagic sub- strate SQSTM1 (log2Fold Change = -1.41, p = 0.020). Finally, we examined the effect of T-068677 on glucose intolerance in T2D model db/db mice. Twice-a-day intraperitoneal injection of 1.0 mg/kg T-068677 for two weeks significantly improved glucose tolerance evaluated by IPGTT (59117 ± 9745 vs 26179 ± 4923, AUC in IPGTT, mean±SEM, p = 0.024).

**Conclusion:**
Our high-throughput screening successfully iden- tified T-068677, a novel compound that increases autophagic flux in pancreatic beta cells via an mTOR-independent pathway. Our molecular analysis demonstrates that T-068677 activates the canonical autophagic pathway and acts on the formation of ULK1 complex and PI3K complex independently of the mTOR path- way, implying the unknown regulation of autophagy may exist. T-068677 mitigated the impairment of autophagic flux caused by lipotoxicity and improved glucose intolerance in diabetic model mice. Our results suggest that T-068677 is a promising candidate for treating beta cell dysfunction in T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Loss of functional β-cell mass in pancre- atic islets is a key factor in the etiology of diabetes. Therapeutic strategies developed in animal models and β-cell lines are fre- quently not translatable to humans, which has impeded the devel- opment of a cure to this date. Isolated human islets, the current experimental gold standard for islet research, pose experimental challenges due to striking variability in their size, cellular compo- sition, function, and purity, as well as low viability and function- ality in prolonged culture. Additionally, their genetic manipula- tion is difficult due to poor penetration efficiency of transduction reagents, including viral particles. To address these challenges, we developed a scalable adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated transduction methodology to modify gene expression in reaggre- gated human islets, or islet microtissues (MT).

**Materials and methods:**
We developed an optimized dissocia- tion and scaffold-free high-throughput reaggregation protocol for primary human islet cells in the presence of AAVs and screened nine AAV capsid variants encoding eGFP to identify the variant with the highest natural affinity for islet cell transduction. 3D confocal microscopy and automated image analysis were used to quantify viral transduction efficiency, transgene expression, and potential impact of viral transduction on islet cell proliferation. Insulin secretion, insulin content, and ATP levels were assessed for possible negative effects on islet MT function and viability. Using the most efficient AAV variant, we knocked down dual-specific- ity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) and compared its effects to harmine, a known DYRK1A inhibitor, on β-cell proliferation.

**Results:**
Among the screened capsid variants, AAV2.7m8 exhibited the highest transduction efficiency (89.9%) and eGFP expression capacity with minimal effects on insulin secretion, insulin content, and ATP levels. However, it significantly reduced the proliferative capacity of islet cells. At lower titers, AAVKP1 exhibited superior transduction efficiency (+7.5%) and comparable transgene expres- sion compared to AAV2.7m8. AAV9 achieved lower transduction efficiencies (61.6%) and displayed more moderate gene expres- sion than AAV2.7m8 but preserved islet cell proliferative capacity. DYRK1A knockdown via AAV2.7m8 increased total proliferation within human islet microtissues (2-fold) but did not induce β-cell proliferation, likely due to the negative effects of AAV transduction on β-cell proliferation. Harmine effectively induced proliferation in both β- and non-β-cells, as previously described.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, we developed a scalable platform for AAV-mediated gene expression modification in human islets, achieving high transduction efficiencies while maintaining stable islet function. Although the AAVs were mostly inert in their effects on islet function, they negatively affected islet cell proliferation, which should be considered for potential therapeutic strategies with AAVs. Our platform enables the study of putative therapeutic tar- gets directly in human islets, potentially contributing to the future development of effective diabetes treatments.

2. the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czechia, First Faculty of

**Background and aims:**
OMA1 is a metalloprotease localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Its role is mostly considered to be in response to various stress stimuli, typically dissipation of mitochon- drial membrane potential, or elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activated OMA1 then cleaves a specific range of mitochon- drial proteins, such as OPA1 and DELE1, most often influencing cell survival. OMA1 should have a significant influence on mitochon- drial architecture, by cleaving OPA1, an important structural protein of mitochondria, and by associating with complexes important for structure of , such as MICOS. Mitochondria are essential for pancreatic beta-cell function, not only by generating ATP, an essential signaling molecule in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but also by regulating ROS production and calcium homeostasis. Although OMA1 is a key enzyme involved in mitochondrial quality control, its role in beta-cells remains largely unexplored. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of OMA1 on mitochondria functions, including metabolism and survival, within the context of pancreatic beta-cells under physiologically relevant conditions.

**Materials and methods:**
To study OMA1 influence on beta-cells, OMA1 CRISPR knockout was introduced in INS-1E cell line. Respi- ration, insulin, and OPA1 protein expression in INS-1E KO and control cells were measured in high (11 mM) a low (3 mM) concentrations of glucose, mimicking the physiological changes in blood glucose. Respi- ration was measured by Oxygraph 2K, for insulin assay, Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTFR) assay was chosen. For viability assessment, cells were treated with various respiratory chain inhibitors, stained by propidium iodide and measured by flow cytometry.

**Results:**
We’ve observed a steep increase in insulin secretion of INS- 1E OMA1 KO after 2-hour treatment in both high and low glucose. These results were accompanied by an elevation of basal and uncoupled respiration, which together support model where absence of OMA1 increase metabolism by remodeling mitochondrial to be more efficient in oxidative phosphorylation. Further, also survival of pan- creatic beta-cells was changed in absence of OMA1. In presence of respiratory chain inhibitors OMA1 KO cell line had increased survival rate in comparison to control.

**Conclusion:**
The results of this study highlight the importance of OMA1 in regulating metabolism and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells, while also confirming its role in cell survival.

1. University of Dundee, Dundee, UK, The James Hutton Institute,

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic beta cells are critical for glucose homeostasis by sensing nutrients and secreting insulin accordingly, with beta cell failure resulting in diabetes. S-acylation is a post-transla- tional modification involving the addition of free fatty acyl groups onto proteins, which can potentially alter protein structure, function and cel- lular localisation. Whilst several beta cell proteins have been reported to undergo S-acylation in endocrine cells, the role of S-acylation in beta cells has not been systematically investigated, yet these data may yield new insights into insulin secretion.

**Materials and methods:**
INS1 832/13 beta cells underwent an insu- lin secretion assay to confirm functionality, before S-acylated proteins were captured using an acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay and ana- lysed by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. Methodol- ogy using R Studio was developed to analyse these data and identify putative S-acylated proteins.

**Results:**
This experiment identified 4,189 proteins with confidence that reacted with ABE chemistry, of which 17% showed enrichment over negative controls, comprising our putative beta cell S-acylome. From these proteins, gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis revealed 20 proteins throughout the insulin secretory pathway includ- ing glucose transporter 2 (FDR 9.22x10-4), synaptotagmin 7 (FDR 1.26x10-12) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (FDR 1.31x10-6). Additional GO terms in our beta cell S-acylome were exocytosis (P 1.21x10-8) and vesicle docking (P 4.47x10-6).

**Conclusion:**
This study has established proteomic methods to identify a previously unreported beta cell S-acylome, identifying potential new nodes of beta cell regulation. This study will underpin future efforts to investigate the impact of metabolic diseases on beta cell protein S-acylation and function.

**Direct impairment of insulin biosynthesis by glucocorticoids via the GR/JNK pathway in pancreatic beta cells**

Y. Iwamoto, Y. Nogami, M. Shimoda, T. Mune, K. Kaku, H. Kaneto

**Background and aims:**
Glucocorticoids cause steroid-induced dia- betes through a complex mechanism that includes both direct effects on pancreatic β-cells and indirect effects via insulin-target organs. However, the precise signaling pathways altered in β-cells remain inadequately understood. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is essential for the development of strategies aimed at preventing glucocorticoid-induced diabetes and for devising targeted therapeutic interventions. We aimed to analyze the direct effects of glucocorticoids on the function and morphology of pancreatic β cells using mouse and cell experiments.

**Materials and methods:**
experiment, 7-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were orally administered corticosterone (C) or dexa- methasone (D) mixed with their drinking water: Vehicle (V) group, C group (50 μg/L: mixed water), D group (10 μg/mL: mixed water). After 2 weeks of intervention, various metabolic parameters were eval- uated. In addition, mRNA expression was analyzed using qPCR. experiments were conducted using the MIN6 cell line, a mouse pancreatic β-cell line, with GR agonist (D), GR antagonist (RU-486), and JNK inhibitor (SP600125). In addition, GR knockdown using siRNA was also evaluated after administration of D.

**Results:**
experiment, only Group D showed hyperglycemia after 2 weeks of medication. Serum ACTH levels were significantly sup- pressed in Groups C and D compared to Group V (p<0.001). There was no difference in the number of pancreatic β-cells or α-cells in the islets of Langerhans among the 3 groups after medication as observed by electron microscopy. On the other hand, the quality and quantity of insulin granules in pancreatic β-cells were significantly suppressed in Groups C and D compared to Group V as observed by electron microscopy. The mRNA expression of Ins1, Ins2, Pdx1, and MafA in pancreatic islets was suppressed in Groups C and D compared to Group V. And glucocorticoid administration enhanced the expression of Mkk4, Jnk, and c-Jun in pancreatic la islets. experiments were also performed to evaluate the direct effect of GR signaling on insulin biosynthesis in pancreatic β-cells. The results showed that the number of insulin granules, as evaluated by electron microscopy, insulin-related gene expression such as Ins1, Ins2, Pdx1, and MafA, assessed by qPCR, and cell viability were significantly reduced by D administration, while these parameters were maintained by the com- bined administration of D and either the GR antagonist (RU-486) or the JNK inhibitor (SP600125), as well as GR knockdown by siRNA.

**Conclusion:**
Glucocorticoids directly suppressed insulin synthesis in pancreatic β-cells, even in the absence of hyperglycemia. The direct mechanism of action of glucocorticoids on pancreatic β-cell damage was found to be the effect on insulin-related gene expression and the quality of insulin granules via the GR/JNK pathway. Therefore, inhibi- tion of glucocorticoid receptor signaling in pancreatic β-cells acts as a protective effect on the pancreas and suppresses the decline in insulin biosynthesis.

**Identification of irisin receptors on pancreatic beta cells**

**Background and aims:**
Irisin is a myokine secreted by skeletal mus- cle in response to physical activity and a diet rich in saturated fats, derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the membrane protein FNDC5 (fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5). Irisin is known to improve glucose homeostasis and promote energy expenditure by act- ing on various tissues and organs, thereby regulating multiple meta- bolic pathways. We previously demonstrated that irisin increases insu- lin biosynthesis, enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), promotes β-cell proliferation, and protects pancreatic β-cells and islets from lipotoxicity-induced apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo in mice. Moreover, circulating irisin levels are significantly reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) compared to controls, and exogenous iri- sin has been shown to restore β-cell functional defects in these patients. While irisin effects on bone and adipose tissue were reported to be mediated via the αV integrin receptor, the presence of an irisin receptor in pancreatic β-cells has not been investigated.

**Materials and methods:**
Irisin effects on GSIS and irisin intracellular trafficking were investigated in INS-1 rat insulinoma cells. A pull- down/mass spectrometry approach and the novel Ligand-Receptor- Capture-TriCEPS (LRC-TriCEPS) technology were used to identify irisin-associated proteins.

**Results:**
We found that irisin activates intracellular signaling and enhances GSIS also in the presence of specific αV integrin gene knock- down or a chemical inhibitor of integrins (RGDS), thus excluding the involvement of integrin receptors in irisin effects. Additionally, irisin does not activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK), the main intracellu- lar mediator of integrin-activated signaling. Using a pull-down/mass spectrometry approach, we identified 102 irisin interactors in human pancreatic islets, most of which are associated with intracellular com- partments and do not include canonical membrane receptors. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that irisin undergoes endocyto- sis in pancreatic β-cells, and we confirmed this through immunoblot analysis evaluating intracellular proteins and immunofluorescence assays. Furthermore, both nystatin, an inhibitor of lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, and heat denaturation of irisin, a strategy to block protein endocytosis, interfered with irisin internalization in pancreatic β-cells. To investigate the role of endocytosis in irisin biological effect, we used a His-tagged irisin and found that it is not endocytosed and nor does it enhance GSIS in INS-1E cells. Lastly, using LRC-TriCEPS technology, we aimed to identify membrane-anchored proteins that might mediate irisin endocytosis. Preliminary results show that irisin anchors to the plasma membrane of β-cells before being endocytosed.

**Conclusion:**
These findings demonstrate for the first time that irisin effects on pancreatic β-cells are independent of integrin αV receptor engagement. The inability of His-tagged irisin, which is not endocy- tosed, to enhance GSIS, suggests that irisin biological effect on pan- creatic β-cells are dependent on its endocytosis.

3. cine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada, Ionis Pharma-

**Background and aims:**
Increasing functional β-cell mass by promot- ing β-cell proliferation is a potential approach to restore normogly- cemia in patients with diabetes. β-cell proliferation is influenced by various mitogenic stimuli [eg. high-fat diet (HFD), Exendin-4 (Ex-4)] and regulated by the nuclear translocation of Cyclin-CDK complexes. 14-3-3 scaffold proteins can directly influence proliferation by interact- ing with cyclins and CDKs and influencing their compartmentaliza- tion and activity. We previously reported that acute 14-3-3 inhibition promotes β-cell proliferation and that β-cell-specific 14-3-3ζ knockout (β14-3-3ζKO) mice had increased β-cell proliferation. Thus, I hypoth- esize that targeting 14-3-3ζ in β-cells postnatally enhances β-cell pro- liferation and functional β-cell mass.

**Materials and methods:**
To deplete 14-3-3ζ in β-cells, anti- sense oligonucleotides (ASO) conjugated to GLP-1 (GLP- 1-ASO and GLP-1-ASO ) were administered to 12-week- old male C57BL/6J mice ( 1 mg/kg weekly, 4 weeks). The effects of GLP-1-ASO were compared to our recently developed β14-3- 3ζKO mice. To assess if 14-3-3ζ deletion or depletion affects β-cell function or responsiveness to proliferative stimuli, mice were fed a 60% HFD or treated with Ex-4 (10 nmol/kg b.i.d., 7 days). β-cell mass and proliferation were measured by co-immunostaining for insulin and PCNA, Ki-67, or EdU (200 μg/day i.p. for 3 days).

**Results:**
Contrary to our prior finding that β-cell mass between chow- fed control and β14-3-3ζKO mice was not different, despite increased PCNA-positive β-cells ( ), β14-3-3ζKO mice fed HFD for 8 weeks had significant increases in both β-cell mass ( n=3- 4) and PCNA-positive proliferating β-cells ( ), suggesting increased sensitivity of 14-3-3ζ-deficient β-cells to mitogenic stimuli. This was further confirmed with significantly increased Ki-67-positive β-cells ( ) and β-cell mass ( ) in Ex-4-treated β14-3-3ζKO mice . Postnatal depletion of 14-3-3ζ in isolated islets from GLP- 1-ASO -treated mice resulted in up to 90% decreases in mRNA levels of (GLP-1-ASO and GLP-1-ASO ), demonstrating efficacy of this approach. Similar to β14-3-3ζKO mice fed a chow diet, both GLP-1-ASO treat- ments significantly increased β-cell proliferation ( ), without concomitant increases in β-cell mass. Preliminary data from GLP-1-ASO -treated mice fed HFD for 10 weeks showed no increases in β-cell proliferation and mass. Furthermore, GLP- 1-ASO -treated HFD-fed mice had significant glucose intolerance (GLP-1-ASO : GLP-1-ASO : . Transient increases in body weight (13.49%, ) and fat mass (20.96%, ) were observed with GLP-1-ASO - treated HFD-fed mice.

**Conclusion:**
Altogether, acute depletion of 14-3-3ζ via GLP- 1-ASO increases β-cell proliferation. However, the absence of a HFD-induced mitogenic response and negative metabolic phenotypes suggest that this approach is not suitable to investigate the effects of postnatal 14-3-3ζ depletion on β-cell proliferation.

4. Heidelberg, Germany, Institute for Diabetes and Cancer (IDC),

**Background and aims:**
Chronic hyperglycemia leads to pancreatic beta cells death (also known as beta cell exhaustion) via induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, causing insulin deficiency and type 2 diabetes. Previously, we identified evolutionarily conserved TSC22D4 protein as a novel interactor of protein kinase Akt1, which contributed to diabetic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Inter- estingly, high glucose stimulation impairs TSC22D4-Akt interac- tion, which prompted us to address whether TSC22D4 also plays role in pancreatic beta cells, where glucose sensing is key to insulin secretion. Hence, in this project, we aim to understand the role of TSC22D4 protein controlling insulin production and secretion in pancreatic beta cells.

**Materials and methods:**
We received mRNA isolated from tumor- free pancreatic biopsies obtained from Pathology Department at a University Hospital, followed by cDNA synthesis and qPCR analysis. We silenced TSC22D4 gene in rat insulinoma Ins1 cells to perform our functional assays such as glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), induction of ER stress via glucose, palmitate, CPA, and thapsigargin treatments, qPCR analysis for gene expression measure- ments, ELISA to measure insulin levels; as well as co-immunopre- cipitation experiments followed by western blotting to investigate the interaction of TSC22D4 with mTORC1 component raptor.

**Results:**
Our results show that patients with type 2 diabetes have 25% more TSC22D4 expression in their pancreas compared to healthy group (p<0.05). Similarly, in Ins1e cells CPA-induced ER stress or high glucose [20 mM] treatment promoted TSC22D4 gene expression 3-fold (p<0.01). Silencing TSC22D4 reduced the expres- sion of ER stress markers such as Ddit3 (CHOP) and ATF4 also, while increasing the expression of beta-cell identity genes Ins1, Pdx1 and Glut2 2-fold (p<0.0001). Additionally, in the absence of TSc22D4, cells showed impaired mTORC1 hyperactivation upon glucose [20 mM] and palmitate [0.5 mM] stimulation. Silencing TSC22D4 also elevated both intracellular insulin content (p<0.01) and secretion 2-fold upon high glucose stimulations (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). Mechanistically, we found out that similar TSC22D4 interacts with raptor, a critical component of mTORC1 and this interaction responds to nutrient availability and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

**Conclusion:**
Here, we identify TSC22D4 as a novel regulator of beta cell function. Our data suggest that ER stress promotes TSC22D4 expression, which in turn impairs insulin synthesis and secretion; potentially contributing to pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Further- more, TSC22D4 promotes hyperactivation of mTORC1 under glucoli- potoxic conditions, which might be mediated by its interaction with mTORC1 component raptor. Interestingly, both starvation and induc- tion of ER-stress by thapsigargin impairs TSC22D4-raptor interac- tion. In the follow-up experiments, we will extend our studies to the setting by employing the beta cell specific TSC22D4 knockout mice; which is available in our lab.

**Inflammation increases O-GlucNacylation in pancreas**

H. Pahwa

**Background and aims:**
Repeated enteroviral infections particularly by coxsackieviruses B (CVBs) and enteroviral RNA deposits in the pan- creas have been linked to autoimmunity induction and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Enteroviruses modulate the expression of Hippo pathway terminal effector- Yes-associated Protein (YAP), thereby enhancing an antiviral, proinflammatory response in the whole pancreas including both endocrine and exocrine cells. The mechanism of such deleterious pro-inflamma- tory crosstalk in the pancreas and of the activation of YAP is not clear. Here we show that the CVB4 infection machinery and subsequent YAP expression induction is specifically active under hyperglycemia associated O-GlucNacylation.

**Materials and methods:**
Pancreatic endocine-exocrine co-cultures from organ donors were exposed to CVB4, and YAP protein levels analyzed by western blot and immunocytochemistry (ICC). YAP protein was co- immunoprecipitated from control and CVB4 infected primary human pancreatic endocrine and exocrine co-cultures to investigate O-Gluc- Nacylation states.

**Results:**
Viral CVB4 as well as pro-inflammatory conditions simultane- ously increased the total O-GlucNacylation and YAP protein levels in the pancreatic cells within 24 hrs of treatment. In addition, co-immunoprecip- itation experiments suggested that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) bound to YAP and this association increased in CVB4 infected pancreatic cells. YAP-OGT association also correlated with increased association of YAP with TEAD in CVB4 infected pancreatic cells. When CVB4 infected cells were treated with pleconaril to halt viral multiplication, YAP-TEAD binding was reduced inspite of sustained YAP-OGT association.

**Conclusion:**
Our work uncovers YAP O-GlucNacylation as one of the possible mechanisms for YAP hyperactivity in the exocrine pancreas. We also suggest that the pro-inflammatory activity of YAP depends on its tran- scriptional partners. These results show parallels of enterovirus associated autoimmunity and pancreatitis.

**Background and aims:**
T2DM is a severe global health problem that causes prolonged disease exposure and elevated risk for chronic com- plications, posing a substantial health burden. Although therapies, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors, have been success- fully developed, new therapeutic options are still expected to offer bet- ter blood glucose control and decrease complications.The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which TERT/FOXO1 affects HG-induced dysfunction in islet β-cells via the regulation of ATG9A- mediated autophagy.

**Materials and methods:**
HFD-fed/STZ-treated mice or HG-treated MIN6 cells were used to establish T2DM models. FBG and insulin levels in mice, as well as morphological changes in islet tissues, were assessed. Cell proliferation and the apoptosis rate were measured via EdU assays and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression levels of TERT, FOXO1, ATG9A and autophagy-related proteins (LC3B, p62) were analyzed via western blotting. The relationship between FOXO1 and ATG9A was assessed using dual-luciferase reporter gene assays and ChIP assays.

**Results:**
T2DM modeling in HFD-fed/STZ-treated mice and HG- treated MIN6 cells led to elevated TERT and FOXO1 expression and reduced ATG9A expression. Mice with T2DM were found to have decreased body weight, worsened morphology, elevated FBG and suppressed insulin levels. HG-treated MIN6 cells exhibited decreased viability and LC3B expression, in addition to increased p62 expression and apoptosis rates. FOXO1 knockdown both in vitro and in vivo pro- tected mice and cells against islet β-cell dysfunction via the activation of autophagy. The molecular mechanism involved the suppression of ATG9A expression by TERT through FOXO1 transcription activation.

**Conclusion:**
Our results suggested that TERT/FOXO1 inhibits ATG9A expression to decrease islet β-cell function in T2DM.

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic α-cells are resistant to diabetogenic viruses, helping to explain their survival in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Similarly, bats have enhanced viral resistance, suggesting the presence of convergent evolution in antiviral mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we com- pared global gene expression in fibroblasts from the bat exposed to PolyIC (PMID: 37575178) against human α- and β-cells. Moreover, previous studies in bats and murine tissues determined distinct virus resistance and tolerance scores (PMID: 37575178; PMID: 36516834), which were also tested in human α- and β-cells. The aim is to uncover key mechanisms of viral resistance between α-cells and bats that may be used to improve β-cell resistance against viruses.

**Materials and methods:**
Bulk (n=12, FACS-sorted) and scRNA-seq (n=14) datasets of human islets from non-diabetic donors were obtained from the Human Pancreas Analysis Program. DESeq2 was used for bulk RNA-seq analysis, while scRNA-seq data were processed with CellRanger and Seurat. The top 300 α- and β-cell-specific genes were identified based on differential gene expression in bulk RNA-seq. Virus resistance and tolerance scores were compared between α- and β-cells using the Mann- Whitney test. To validate a candidate gene, EndoC-βH1 cells were trans- fected with siRNA-ISG15 and treated with or without IFNα (2000 U/mL, 48h). Primary human islet microtissues (hisMTs) underwent transduction with AAVs encoding a shRNA-ISG15, followed by a 6-day treatment with TNFα (25 ng/mL), IL1β (5 ng/mL), IFNγ (25 ng/mL), and IFNα (10 ng/ mL). Gene and protein expression were assessed by RT-qPCR, immu- noblotting, 3D staining, and imaging, while apoptosis was evaluated via propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 staining, with results analyzed by ANOVA (n=3-6 experiments).

**Results:**
α-cells exhibited greater similarity to the antiviral responses of fibroblasts compared to β-cells (P-adjusted<0.0001). Further- more, α-cells displayed a higher virus resistance score than β-cells (P=0.02), supporting their greater survival capacity during viral infections. ISG15 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15), a key regulator of the antiviral responses in bats was identified as ~2.8-fold more expressed in α-cells than in β-cells (P<0.0001). ISG15 knockdown (KD) in EndoC-βH1 cells led to increased basal and IFNα-induced apoptosis (45% increase, P<0.05), upregulation of HLA-ABC mRNA (126% increase, P<0.05) and enhanced CXCL10 expres- sion and secretion (180% increase, P<0.05). ISG15 KD decreased hisMTs volume and total cell count, together with the NKX6.1 and ­ARX cells, supporting a role for ISG15 in maintaining α- and β-cell integrity. Finally, ISG15 KD sensitized β-cells to cytopathogenic effect induced by infection with the diabetogenic virus CVB1 (~74% increase in cell death; P=0.0002) and increased the viral production by 12x (P=0.015).

**Conclusion:**
Human α-cells exhibit a stronger correlation, as compared to β-cells, with the virus resistance gene program present in bats. The higher expression of ISG15 in α-cells, like observations made in bats, may contribute to their enhanced resistance to viral/diabetogenic stresses.

**Background and aims:**
The early stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are marked by abnormal islet inflammation, influenced partially by the interplay between genetic susceptibility and environmental trig- gers. Genome-wide association studies have identified >70 loci across the human genome associated with the risk of T1D. Of interest, one SNP in the Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 ( ) has been shown to regulate an interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-driven inflamma- tory network (IDIN) in monocytes that may contribute to T1D risk. However, little is known about EBI2’s function in β-cells. To evaluate whether EBI2 plays a role in β-cell responses to "danger signals" and determine the mechanisms involved.

**Materials and methods:**
INS-1E cells were transfected with small interfer- ing RNAs targeting EBI2 and then exposed to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PIC; a synthetic analogue of viral dsRNA) or coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5). Apoptosis was evaluated by DNA-binding dyes. mRNA and pro- tein expression were determined by qPCR and western blot, respectively. Promoter activity was assessed by luciferase assay.

**Results:**
EBI2 knockdown (KD) induced apoptosis under basal condi- tions and further increased PIC- and CVB5-induced apoptosis (p<0.05). Compared to control cells, EBI2-silenced cells exposed to PIC showed higher mRNA expression levels of IRF7 (5-fold; p<0.05), IFNβ (20-fold; p<0.05), CXCL10 (6-fold; p<0.05), and CCL5 (10-fold; p<0.05). Studies of promoter activity showed that EBI2 KD increased PIC-stimulated ISRE activity by nearly 10-fold, while IFNβ activity was 6- to 10-fold higher in EBI2-inhibited cells (p<0.05). To assess whether the viral sensor MDA5 was involved in PIC-induced IFNβ activity, an EBI2/MDA5 double-KD approach was used. After PIC exposure, EBI2/MDA5 double-KD dimin- ished IFNβ activity secondary to EBI2 inhibition. Finally, an EBI2/IRF7 double-KD showed that IRF7 was key to the increase in IFNβ activity in PIC-treated, EBI2-silenced cells.

**Conclusion:**
Our results indicate that EBI2 modulates β-cell antivi- ral responses via MDA5 and IRF7. As EBI2 potentially regulates the IDIN pathway in monocytes, this pathway may be crucial for β-cell autonomous immune response against infections. These findings will be confirmed in EndoC-βH1 β-cells and human islets.

**Lipid droplets and lipophagy are induced by proinflamma- tory cytokines in beta cells: the role of sphingosine-1 phosphate degradation**

E. Gurgul Convey

**Background and aims:**
Proinflammatory cytokines are mediators of beta cell failure during type 1 diabetes (T1D) development. Profound changes of various lipid species, including sphingolipids, were observed in serum of T1D individuals. Sphingolipids have been shown to regulate lipid droplet (LD) formation in various tissues. LD have been shown to regulate cellular energy, oxidative stress and inflammation. Our group has recently demon- strated that human beta cells are rich in sphingosine-1 phosphate (SPL), the enzyme controlling the only exit point of sphingolipid metabolism, and that SPL strongly regulates LD formation in response to fatty acids. Here we investigate the effects of proinflammatory cytokines and SPL on LD formation and lipophagy in beta cells.

**Materials and methods:**
SPL was overexpressed in rat INS1E, which are characterized by a low endogenous SPL expression and suppress in human EndoC-βH1 beta cells, which are rich in SPL. In the model of acute (24h in rat and 72h in human) or chronic (72h in rat and 5 days in human beta cells) cytokine (IL-1β, TNFα and IFNγ) toxicity, formation of LD was assessed by OilRed staining, followed by the analysis of number, size and intracellular distribution. Neutral lipids were stained with LipidTox, cholesterol with filipin, ceramide, GD3 and lipophagy were analyzed by immunofluorescence. The expression of proteins involved in LD formation and lipophagy were measured by qRTPCR and WB.

**Results:**
Proinflammatory cytokines induced formation of lipid droplets via upregulation of Plin2 expression with a parallel increase in the generation of cholesterol and ceramide, particularly in the mitochondrial compart- ment. The cytokine-mediated stimulation of LD formation was stronger upon chronic (72 h, 4-fold) vs. short (24 h, 2.7-fold) exposure to cytokines. The lipophagy was active in INSE-ctr cells exposed to cytokines and Plin5 was colocalized to mitochondria, indicating transfer of lipids from LD into mitochondria. The size of LD in INS1E-ctr treated for 24 h with cytokines was larger than in untreated cells, but was reduced upon chronic cytokine exposure. Interestingly, the expression of Plin2 and other proteins involved in LD biogenesis was significantly lower in beta cells with a high SPL expression. Upon short time exposure to cytokines, no significant increase in LD formation was detected in INS1E-SPL cells. Under chronic expo- sure, a weak formation of LD of smaller size was observed in INS1E-SPL cells as compared to INS1E-ctr cells. INS1E-SPL cells exposed for short time to cytokines were characterized by a reduced intracellular cholesterol and mitochondrial ceramide with a parallel protection against apoptosis. Interestingly, INS1E-SPL cells tended to form large hubs of cholesterol and of GD3 ganglioside on cell membrane suggesting a more efficient for- mation of signaling lipid rafts upon chronic cytokine exposure. The high expression of SPL protected beta cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis under short exposure, but accelerated cytokine-mediated nonapoptotic cell death upon chronic exposure. In human EndoC-βH1 beta cells cytokines stimulated LD formation in a delayed manner. Suppression of SPL led to a faster mode of LD formation and increased LD number and size after exposure to cytokines.

**Conclusion:**
We postulate that lipid droplet formation might be a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of beta cell susceptibility to pro- inflammatory cytokines during T1D development.

**Stressed beta cells degrade the peri-islet extracellular matrix con- tributing to islet death and dysfunction in type 1 diabetes**

N.L. Farnsworth

**Background and aims:**
The peri-islet extracellular matrix (ECM) is com- posed primarily of laminin and collagen IV and provides cues that support islet function and survival. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by auto- immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic islet β cells. In the early stages of T1D, infiltrating immune cells secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that disrupt islet function and lead to β-cell death. While loss of the peri-islet ECM has been well characterized in T1D, contributions from loss of these critical environmental cues on islet function and survival have not been explored in the context of T1D. Additionally, previous studies have shown that loss of the peri-islet ECM correlates with the degree of insulitis. However, more recent studies suggest that stressed β-cells upregulate gene expression of ECM degrading enzymes, suggesting that the β-cell may contribute to loss of the peri-islet ECM in T1D. Finally, inhibition of the ECM degrading enzyme heparinase in the NOD mouse prevents islet dys- function and death. The goal of this study is to determine if stressed β-cells degrade the peri-islet ECM in T1D and if loss of ECM cues contributes to islet death and dysfunction that is observed in early T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Human islets were treated with a 20mM glu- cose or a pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail (10ng/mL TNF-α, 5ng/mL IL-1β and 10ng/mL IFN-γ) for 24h-72h to analyze gene expression of ECM degrading enzymes. Pancreas sections from normoglycemic and diabetic NOD, age-matched NOD-Scid controls, double autoantibody positive organ donors, recent onset (<6 months) T1D organ donors, and healthy controls were stained for matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), laminin, collagen IV, and insulin. Islets from C57Bl/6 mice or human cadaveric donors were encapsulated in a reverse thermal gel scaffold functionalized with laminin or poly-L-lysine as a negative control and treated with a pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail. Viability was assessed with a live/dead stain and regula- tion of pro-survival signaling was determined via western blotting.

**Results:**
Human islets stressed with cytokines or hyperglycemia upregulate expression of ECM degrading enzymes, including MMP3 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 2 motif (ADAMTS2). Loss of collagen IV and laminin in the peri-islet ECM is observed in early stages of T1D in humans and NOD mice and correlates with insulitis. MMP3 is upregulated in β-cells of infiltrated normo- and hyperglycemic NOD islets and correlates with loss of collagen IV independent of insulitis score, suggesting that β-cells contribute to loss of the peri-islet ECM in T1D. Isolated islets encapsulated in a scaffold functionalized with laminin are protected against cytokine-induced death compared to control islets cultured without laminin. Laminin confers protection via upregulation of pro-survival signaling including activation of Akt.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, our results suggest that stressed β-cells degrade the peri-islet ECM leading to a loss of pro-survival signaling that potentially accelerates β-cell death and dysfunction in T1D.

**Background and aims:**
Autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), are often studied from an immune perspective with less focus on target tissue responses. Using RNA seq data, we identified shared inflammatory pathways in both diseases - particularly related to interferon (IFN) signatures - and explored this knowledge to identify therapies to protect β cells. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 inhibitors (FGFR1i) emerged as candidates to counteract immune-induced pathogenic mechanisms. We presently aimed to determine protective effects of PD173074 (PDi), a selective FGFR1i, on human β-cells.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed bulk RNA seq data (T1D: 4 cases vs 12 controls; HT: 15 cases vs 32 controls), single-cell RNA seq data (6 T1D, 2 AAB2+, 9 AAB1+, 15 controls), and our own bulk RNA-seq data from stem cell (SC)-derived islet-like cells or follicular thyroid-like cells treated with IFNα (2000 U/mL) or IFNγ (1000 U/mL) for 24h. Rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO)-RedRibbon pipeline was used to identify similar gene expression signatures between diseases and the top 150 com- monly up-/downregulated genes were analyzed using Connectivity Map to identify candidates for drug repurposing. An IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signature was assessed across diseases. To validate bioinformatic findings, EndoC-βH1 cells were pre-treated with PDi at 1, 5, and 10 μM for 2h, fol- lowed by 24h exposure to IFNα or IFNγ. Gene and protein expression were assessed via RT-qPCR and flow cytometry (FACS). For co-culture experi- ments, SC-derived islet-like cells pre-treated with IFNγ and/or PDi for 24h were cultured for 4h with HLA-A2 restricted pre-proinsulin-specific CD8+ T cells. T cell activation was determined by FACS. Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction (mean ± SEM, n=6-8).

**Results:**
RRHO of bulk RNA seq demonstrated significant transcrip- tomic overlap between T1D and HT, with commonly upregulated genes associated with inflammation (e.g., innate/adaptive immunity, autoim- mune thyroiditis, IFN signaling, and antigen presentation). ISG scores were significantly elevated across both disease states (T1D and HT). FGFR1i emerged as a potential strategy to counteract these inflam- matory transcriptional signatures. IFNα and IFNγ exposure induced upregulation of immune-related genes ( ; 85-90% increase; P<0.001), whereas PDi suppressed IFN-induced pro-inflam- matory gene expression in a dose-dependent manner, with the strongest effect observed at 10 μM (40-50% decrease; P<0.01). PDi preserved IFN-induced protective genes and , and FACS analysis confirmed PDi’s ability to enhance surface PDL1 expression on β-cells (60% increase; P<0.01). In co-culture experiments, IFNγ increased T cell activation in response to SC-derived islet-like cells by 30% (P<0.001) and this was prevented by PDi.

**Conclusion:**
The present findings, based on comparative studies between two autoimmune endocrine diseases, identified PDi as an inhibitor of IFN- induced β-cell inflammation. Importantly, PDi preserves β cell protective gene expression, leading to reduced activation of CD8+ T cells.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune dis- ease characterized by a progressive destruction of pancreatic beta-cells by autoreactive T cells through inflammation, oxidative stress and/or direct cell cytotoxicity. (Tardigrade) is a metazoan showed high resistance to several adverse conditions through synthesizing DSUP (Damage Suppressor protein), responsible for the protection effects. We aim to investigate whether DSUP protects beta- cells from inflammatory and/or oxidative stress.

**Materials and methods:**
MIN6 murine beta-cells were stably trans- fected with His-Tagged DSUP-expressing plasmid or CTR-plasmid, and expression verified using immunofluorescence staining and confo- cal microscopy. Stably transfected, CTR and not-transfected (NT) cells were subjected to inflammatory stress (IL-1β+TNFα+IFNγ) for 24h and 48h, or to oxidative stress (100-250 μM ­H O - 90min, 4h and 12h). Apoptosis rate [pyknotic nuclei (PN+) and Propidium Iodide (PI+)], cell viability (MTT assay) and Glucose Stimulated Insulin Secretion (GSIS) were evaluated to assess DSUP-mediated protection effect on survival and function.

**Results:**
In MIN6 cells, DSUP was successfully expressed and local- ized to the nucleus. Overexpression of DSUP reduced inflammation- induced apoptosis (Untreated: CTR = 2.6 ± 0.9, DSUP = 2.31 ± 0.6; Cytokine-treated: CTR = 6.98 ± 1.8, DSUP = 3.06 ± 0.6; p = 0.04, CTR vs. DSUP). Moreover, DSUP-overexpressing cells were protected from oxidative stress, displaying increased viability (Fold change vs. NT = 1.4, p = 0.04; vs. CTR = 1.7, p = 0.03). GSIS analysis revealed no significant differences in the functional response of DSUP-overex- pressing MIN6 cells.

**Conclusion:**
DSUP protects beta-cells from both inflammatory and oxidative stresses, thus opening a new frontier for a potential thera- peutic strategy against T1D.

**Beta cell death under chronic cytokine exposure is mediated by excessive sphingosine-1 phosphate degradation linked to defective mitochondrial quality control**

M. Majewska

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, char- acterized by a selective death of pancreatic beta cells. Proinflammatory cytokines released by activated immune cells infiltrating islets induce in beta cells a strong stress response leading to mitochondrial damage and death. Human beta cells are characterized by a delayed development of cytokine-mediated toxicity as compared to rodent beta cells. So far the underlying mechanisms making human beta cells vulnerable to chronic, but not to acute cytokine toxicity, remain unclear. Our former studies indicate that the expression of sphingosine-1 phosphate lyase (SPL) is abundant in human vs. rat beta cells; and that ectopic SPL overexpression protects rat beta cells from early cytokine toxicity. In other cell types SPL was shown to regulate cellular lipid composition, autophagy and mitochondrial func- tion. So far no data is available regarding the role of SPL in mitochondrial disturbances and cell death of human beta cells. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of high SPL activity in beta cells upon chronic cytokine exposure.

**Materials and methods:**
Rat INS1E cells (ctr and SPL overexpressing) were incubated with 600 U/ml IL-1β or a cytokine mixture (60 U/ml IL-1β, 175 U/ml TNFα, 10 U/ml IFNγ) for 24 or 72h. Human EndoC-βH1 beta cells (ctr and SPL-suppressing) were exposed to cytokines for 72 h or 5 days. Caspase 3/7 was measured by Flow. Changes of autophagy markers were measured by qPCR and Western blot. The autophagy flux was ana- lyzed by the EGFP-mRFP-LC3-based method. Mitophagy and mitocytosis were assessed by IF. Mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide was measured by HyPer-Mito.

**Results:**
INS1E-SPL cells were protected from cytokine-induced apopto- sis activation upon short exposure, although a lower basal mitochondrial activity, and highly stimulated autophagy flux and mitophagy as compared to INS1E-ctr cells were observed. Upon chronic cytokine exposure INS1E- SPL (i) were more prone to cytokine toxicity as ctr cells (60 vs 90% viability loss), but (ii) were dying in a non-apoptotic cell death mode as revealed by the lack of caspase 3/7 activation. This went along with a dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control, an overestimulated autophagy flux and induction of mitocytosis. The excessive mitophagy in INS1E-SPL cells was documented by a strong colocalization of mitochondria with lysosomes and was independent of Fundc, a mitophagy receptor. This resulted in a strong inhibition of mitochondrial function and loss of mitochondrial network. Moreover, the expression of MnSOD and mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide generation were higher (2 fold) in cytokine-treated INS1E-SPL vs. ctr cells. In parallel cytokines stimulated the expression of mitochondrial UPR pro- tease Lonp1 more strongly in INS1E-SPL vs. ctr cells. The phenoptype of INS1E-SPL cells was partially rescued by an autophagy inhibitor. In human EndoC-βH1 beta cells chronically exposed to cytokines accumulation of lysosomes and mitochondrial fragmentation were observed, together with cell death. Suppression of SPL increased the basal apoptosis rate (140%), but protected against cytokine-mediated toxicity and regulated mitochon- drial network.

**Conclusion:**
We propose that excessive S1P degradation may be involved in the regulation of beta cell sensitivity to cytokines by modu- lation of the mitochondrial quality control.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by T-cell- mediated destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells, accompanied by progressive innate inflammation in the pancreatic islets during disease progression. The latter is characterized by local production of pro-inflam- matory cytokines and chemokines that exacerbates detrimental inflamma- tory processes and enhance immune cell infiltration. We hypothesized that pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death executed by gasdermin (GSDM) proteins and characterized by release of cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, contributes to the exacerbation of islet inflammation. Despite growing evidence supporting the role of pyroptosis in various inflammatory diseases, its contribution to T1D pathogenesis remains insufficiently explored. We therefore aimed to investigate beta-cell pyroptosis focusing on the role of the key pyroptosis executioner GSDMD for beta-cell killing in isolated human islets exposed to T1D-relevant stimuli and its potential contribution to the inflammatory islet environment in T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Pyroptosis gene signatures were investigated using single cell RNA-seq data from HPAP in human beta cells from non-diabetic controls (ND), type 2 diabetes (T2D), autoantibody-positive (AAB+), and T1D, and bulk RNA-seq data from human islets (n=5) and EndoC-βH5 (n=4). Human pancreatic islets were pretreated with IL-1β, interferon-γ (IFN- γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α) for 48h, and subsequently exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which is a bacterial endotoxin and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist, and nigericin for 3h and 1h, respectively. Pyroptotic activation was determined by evaluating GSDMD cleavage, cell death, and secretion of IL-18 by utilizing western blotting, cytotoxicity assay, and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) U-PLEX IL-18 ELISA kit, respectively.

**Results:**
By RNA-seq data we observed that multiple genes associated with pyroptosis were upregulated in beta cells from donors with T1D, as well as in human islets and EndoC-βH5 cells in response to treat- ment with IL-1β and IFN-γ ±TNF-α. Beta-cell gene expression transcripts per million; TPM) was increased in the T1D group com- pared to ND controls(n=10~27, p=0.009). Real-time qPCR confirmed increased expression levels of pyroptosis genes including (n=4, p<0.0001) and caspase-1 (n=4, p=0.0154) and caspase-4 (n=4, p=0.0006). Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting demon- strated increased expression of full-length GSDMD after pro-inflam- matory cytokine exposure in both human islets and EndoC-βH5 cells. Cytokine treatment alone was insufficient to cause cleavage and acti- vation of GSDMD, but primed islets for LPS and nigericin-induced GSDMD cleavage, increased cytotoxicity, and IL-18 secretion.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that beta-cell pyroptosis should be considered a contributory factor to beta-cell death and exacerbation of intra-islet inflammation in T1D. Further studies in T1D-like settings may uncover therapeutic strategies to preserve beta-cell function and reduce islet inflammation.

**ATPIF1 prevents cell death of pancreatic beta cells under stress conditions**

A. Dlasková

1. Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague,
2. Czechia, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague,

**Background and aims:**
ATPIF1 is an endogenous inhibitor of mito- chondrial ATP synthase, a key enzyme responsible for ATP production in beta cells through oxidative phosphorylation. Our previous work demonstrated that ATPIF1 plays a significant role in pancreatic beta- cell metabolism and insulin secretion under physiological conditions. INS-1E cells lacking ATPIF1 exhibit increased cellular respiration and ATP production, leading to enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secre- tion. This is reflected in a leftward shift of the glucose-insulin dose- response curve, indicating greater glucose sensitivity. Mitochondrial impairment is a key factor contributing to beta cell failure and death, particularly in conditions such as type 2 diabetes, where chronic hyper- glycemia and lipid overload lead to oxidative stress. Since ATPIF1 regulates ATP synthase activity, mitochondrial metabolism, and cristae morphology, we hypothesize that ATPIF1 may also play a role in regu- lating beta-cell survival. This study therefore aims to investigate the impact of ATPIF1 on beta-cell death under stress conditions.

**Materials and methods:**
Beta-cell death was assessed using FACS anal- ysis of propidium iodide-stained cells. Respiration in INS-1E cells was measured using Oxygraph high-resolution respirometry. Insulin levels were quantified using an ELISA kit. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on Epon 812-embedded, chemically fixed samples and mitochondrial ultrastructure was subsequently analyzed in Image J (FIJI).

**Results:**
Using an ATPIF1 CRISPR-Cas9 knockout INS-1E cell line, we demonstrated that ATPIF1 prevents cell death in pancreatic beta-cells under stress conditions. The significant protective effect of ATPIF1 was observed particularly under conditions of increased ROS production by the mitochondrial respiratory chain, loss of mitochon- drial membrane potential, and gluco-lipotoxicity. Our data further sug- gest that the protective role of ATPIF1 is likely due to its function in maintaining cristae shape, rather than the regulation of ATP synthase activity.

**Conclusion:**
Given the importance of mitochondrial integrity in beta- cell function and survival, ATPIF1 may represent a potential therapeu- tic target for preserving beta-cell viability in diabetes.

**Integrative AI-driven modelling of full-length HIF-1α: unravelling structural insights to address dysregulation in diabetes**

C.M. González-Casimiro

**Background and aims:**
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) is a central regulator of cellular responses to hypoxia, orchestrating the expression of genes involved in metabolism, angiogenesis, and sur- vival. In the context of diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), dysregulation of HIF-1α has been implicated in various patho- physiological processes, including impaired wound healing and β-cell dysfunction. Despite its significance, obtaining a high-resolution struc- ture of full-length, natively folded HIF-1α has been challenging due to its intrinsic instability and complex domain architecture.​ To develop an integrative, AI-driven computational strategy to predict the full-length structure of HIF-1α, facilitating a deeper understanding of its role in diabetes mellitus and identifying potential therapeutic targets.​

**Materials and methods:**
We employed a multi-faceted approach com- bining:​ Utilizing existing high-resolution structures of HIF-1α domains as templates, we applied deep learning algorithms to model inter-domain linkers and assemble a full-length structural model.​ A deep generative adversarial network (GAN) was trained on a dataset of eukaryotic transcription factors to predict plausible conformations of HIF-1α’s flexible regions. ​ Molecular dynamics simulations, incorporating experi- mental constraints from cross-linking mass spectrometry and small- angle X-ray scattering data, were performed to refine the structural model.​ An iterative reinforcement learning framework was implemented to optimize the model against biophysi- cal and experimental constraints, ensuring structural plausibility and functional relevance.​

**Results:**
The integrative modeling approach successfully generated a full-length structural model of HIF-1α, revealing insights into its domain organization and conformational dynamics. Notably, the model highlighted regions susceptible to post-translational modifications that are dysregulated in diabetes mellitus. For instance, hyperglycemia- induced methylglyoxal accumulation has been shown to destabilize HIF-1α, impairing its transcriptional activity. Additionally, the model identified potential interaction sites with co-regulatory proteins, offer- ing avenues for therapeutic intervention.​

**Conclusion:**
Our novel computational strategy provides a comprehen- sive structural model of HIF-1α, enhancing our understanding of its functional mechanisms, particularly in the context of diabetes melli- tus. This framework not only elucidates the structural basis of HIF-1α dysregulation in diabetic conditions but also paves the way for the development of targeted therapies aimed at stabilizing HIF-1α function, thereby mitigating diabetes-associated complications.

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic β cells dysfunction and apoptosis are important mechanisms involved in developing diabetes. The role of mitochondrial glycerol - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase(mGPDH) in energy metabolism has attracted the attention of researchers, but its specific function in pancreatic β cells remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of mGPDH in pancreatic β cell and its impact on the pathogenesis of diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
mGPDH expression was analysed using population studies and the GEO database. In the db/db and ob/ob mice, the expression of mGPDH was also verified in the pancreas. To further validate this finding, we generated mGPDH knockout mice(mGPDH-KO) and pancreatic β cell specific mGPDH knockout mouse model(βmGPDH-KO). Construction of β cell overexpression mGPDH mouse model (βmGPDH-OE) using AAV-DIO virus.We also performed mGPDH knockdown and overexpression experiments in MIN6 cells to investigate the effects on insulin secretion and apoptosis.

**Results:**
We observed reduced expression of mGPDH in pancreatic islets from diabetic populations and mouse models, and mGPDH-KO showed significant abnormalities in insulin tolerance test (ITT) and glucose tolerance test (GTT) . It was also found that βmGPDH-KO mice had significantly increased glucose levels in the GTT compared to control mice, indicating impaired islet cell function, and in addi- tion, knockout of mGPDH in MIN6 cells resulted in significantly reduced levels of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). On the other hand, βmGPDH-OE mice had significantly improved GTT. The absence of mGPDH was suggested to be closely associated with apoptosis by transcriptome analysis, as demonstrated by both TUNEL staining and flow cytometry analysis. The results of the RNA sequenc- ing analysis of the islets suggested that the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway may play a role in cell survival and apoptosis.

**Conclusion:**
mGPDH deficiency negatively affects the function of pan- creatic β cells, leading to decreased insulin secretion and increased β cell apoptosis. Regulating the expression or activity of mGPDH may open up new avenues for the treatment of diabetic patients.

**Background and aims:**
Defective insulin secretion from β-cells is a key factor in the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and may be due to a reduced number of insulin secretory granules (ISG) and/or impaired ISG function. To address this issue in human β-cells, we used expansion microscopy (ExM) to achieve nanoscale resolu- tion, measured several ISG features, and assessed their correlation with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

**Materials and methods:**
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pancreatic tissue samples from T2D (n=3) and ND (n=3) multiorgan donors were processed with the ’Magnify’ ExM protocol. Following deparaffinization, samples were embedded in a hydrogel with meth- acrolein for direct biomolecule anchoring and expanded isotropically (expansion factor, EF: 3.1 ± 0.4). Immunostaining for insulin and TOM20 allowed quantification of β-cell ISG size and clustering, as well as assessment of mitochondrial morphology. These parameters were correlated with clinical data and ex-vivo islet insulin secretion in response to 3.3 and 16.7 mM glucose.

**Results:**
ExM enabled clear visualization of individual ISGs and mitochondrial structures in situ. Diabetic β-cells displayed signifi- cantly larger ISGs (265 ± 51 nm vs. 231 ± 45 nm in ND, p<0.05) and increased clustering (36.2% vs. 21.4% in ND, p<0.01). Granule size and clustering showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.90) suggest- ing that larger granules tend to aggregate. Moreover, both granule size and clustering negatively correlated with insulin secretion (see Figure). No differences were observed in β-cell number or granule count per cell between diabetic and control samples. Mitochondria in diabetic β-cells showed a 60% increase in circularity (0.50 ± 0.29 vs. 0.31 ± 0.22 in ND, p<0.001), indicating fragmentation and loss of network integrity.

**Conclusion:**
Expansion microscopy reveals ultrastructural remodeling of T2D human β-cells, specifically showing, in this preliminary series of experiments, ISG enlargement and abnormal clustering, rather than a reduction in ISG content. These findings may help identify strategies to improve β-cell function in T2D.

**Dietary interventions reverse beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes**

N. Sinha, Rosengren

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by beta-cell dysfunction, influenced by dietary and metabolic stressors like chronic hyperglycemia and elevated free fatty acids. These stressors overburden beta-cells, causing irreversible damage and disease pro- gression if unaddressed. Existing treatment partially alleviates beta- cell load but fails to stop the gradual beta- failure. A critical gap exists in our understanding of when and how dietary interventions may rescue beta cell deterioration. To investigate the effects of dietary interventions on beta-cell function and metabolic recovery in three mouse models: C57BL/6N, db/db, and fumarase mice.

**Materials and methods:**
The C57BL6/N mice were divided into three groups receiving continuous high-fat diet (HFD) for 25 weeks, HFD for 13 weeks followed by a switch to a chow diet, and continuous chow diet (control). Db/db mice were divided into five groups receiving insulin pellets at 8 or 10 weeks, calorie restriction at 8 or 10 weeks, or no treatment (control). Fumarase mice, which develop reduced insulin secretion because of mitochondrial dysfunction, were divided into three groups: insulin pellets at 8 or 10 weeks or no pellets (control).

**Results:**
C57BL/6N mice on continuous HFD had significantly increased body weight and blood glucose in vivo and impaired glucose- stimulated insulin secretion in vitro compared to mice on a continu- ous chow diet, while those switching from HFD to chow diet showed partial reversal of hyperglycemia and insulin secretion. In db/db mice, calorie restriction at 10 weeks reduced hyperglycemia and enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion, outperforming insulin-pellet interventions. Fumarase mice with insulin pellets exhibited improved glycemic control, though gene expression profiles indicated divergent metabolic adaptations. Gene expression analysis showed downregu- lation of , , beta-cell identity regulators ( , ), and mitochondrial genes ( , ) in C57BL6/N mice on continuous HFD. Switching to a chow diet partially restored the expression of these genes.

**Conclusion:**
These findings underscore the plasticity of beta-cell function and the therapeutic potential of targeted nutritional strate- gies. While dietary modifications improved metabolic control and insu- lin secretion, lingering transcriptional changes highlight the need for early intervention to mitigate irreversible beta-cell damage. This work advances understanding of diet-driven beta-cell adaptation, offering potential insights for T2D management.

**Background and aims:**
Functional loss of human pancreatic islet β-cells is common to both Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Dia- betes (T2D). Calcium signaling is essential to the regulated release of islet hormones. Two main intracellular Calcium release channels, each encoded by three genes, are involved 1) the ryanodine recep- tors ( , , and ) and 2) the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors ( , , and ). We used scRNA-seq to assess the distribution, relative expression, and changes in levels of these ­Ca -release channels in islets from individuals without diabetes (ND), with T1D or T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Expression of the six ­Ca -release chan- nel transcripts ( , ) with pro-hormone transcripts , , and in α, β, and δ cells across ND, T1D, and T2D transcrip- tomes (total n=95532) from 16 publicly available human single-cell RNA sequencing datasets was analyzed. Normalized read counts across all datasets were merged and analyzed for expression level differences in these transcripts. The data were compared by nonparametric analy- sis and significance was reported with adjusted p-values (Bonferroni correction). Splice variant analysis for and in bulk RNAseq datasets will be presented.

**Results:**
In individuals without diabetes, >2.48% (of n=35907) β cells and >24.86% (of n=6074) δ cells express and , whilst >12.45% (of n=40714) α cells expressed . Except for and in α cells, and in β cells, and and in δ cells, all other transcripts showed significant differences in their expression levels (P<0.01). Cross-sectional analyses between individuals without (ND) and with diabetes [Fig. 1] indicated an increased abundance of and transcripts in T2D (P<0.001), especially in β cells (n=35907 vs 1092, P<0.0001). However, in T1D, the abundance decreased in β cells (n=35097 vs 1092, P<0.05). The abundance of also decreased in α, β, and δ cells (P<0.05), but the abundance of and decreased only in α and β cells, respectively (n=40714 vs 1802, P<0.05; and n=35907 vs 1092, P<0.001). Decreases in the abundance of non-lineage specific pro-hormone transcripts ( and in α cells, and in β cells, and in δ cells) were seen in T1D as well as T2D (P< 0.0001).

**Conclusion:**
Our analyses of ­Ca -release channel transcripts at the single-cell level reveal their expression pattern in pancreatic islet cells and help further elucidate the potential roles of the and genes in β cell functional loss in diabetes. Decreased abundance of non- lineage specific pro-hormone transcripts and increased abundance of ­Ca -release channel transcripts indicated β cell stress in T2D. Splice variant analysis will help identify molecules or stressors associated with islet cell functional loss in diabetes.

**SARS-CoV2 NSP1 inhibits insulin granule biogenesis and secretion but not MHC-class I expression and traffic in MIN6 cells**

K.-P. Knoch, K. Ganss, M. Solimena

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the auto- immune destruction of beta-cells of the pancreas. RNA viruses of the enterovirus (HEV) family, such as coxsackievirus B (CVB), are among the candidate environmental factors that trigger and/or accelerate the development of T1D. Recent studies show that the incidence of T1D is also increased in SARS-CoV2 infected subjects and overall. Specifi- cally, new T1D diagnoses are more likely among patients with previous COVID-19 than with other viral respiratory infections. Like HEVs, SARS-CoV2 is also a RNA virus, but with a more complex genome and structure than CVB. In this study, we investigated how SARS- Cov2 nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) affects insulin biosynthesis and beta cell function.

**Materials and methods:**
Mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells were trans- fected with different NSPs. Levels of insulin and other granule car- goes in control and CVB5 expressing cells were assessed by western blotting, ELISA or immunostaining. Luciferase based assays were performed for comparative reporter gene studies. The luminal pH in different compartments along the secretory pathway of living MIN6 cells was measured with several CFP-based reporters by FLIM.

**Results:**
NSP1 blocks the ribosome entry site, leading to a dramatic loss of all tested secretory granule cargoes, with inhibition of SG biogenesis and secretion. Surprisingly, NSP1 expression did not pre- vent IFN-gamma stimulated biosynthesis of H2-Kb and beta-2-mi- croglobulin (b2MG) MHC class I molecules, and their traffic to the cell surface. Reporter gene assays indicated that the 5’-UTRs of both H2-Kb and b2MG form secondary structures similar to the stem loop at the 5-UTR of SARS-CoV2 RNA, thereby enabling them to bypass the NSP1-induced translational blocks. In parallel, NSP1 expression prevented the progressive lumen acidification along the secretory path- way, with the pH in the ERGIC, Golgi and TGN cisternae being 7.2-7.4 as in the ER.

**Conclusion:**
Our data suggest that SARS-CoV2 NSP1 does not affect the expression and traffic to the surface of MHC class I in MIN6 cells. Yet, the MHC class I antigen repertoire may still be affected by the block of protein translation as well as by neutralization of the Golgi complex preventing the otherwise acidification-induced elution of weakly bound peptides.

**Background and aims:**
The activation of islet stellate cells (ISCs) plays an important role in islet fibrosis, which leads to impaired islet function subsequently. While our previous work showed that the expression of gene was significantly increased in activated ISCs, it remains unknown whether is responsible for islet fibrosis. This study was aimed to elucidate its function on islet fibrosis, along with the exploration of the underlined mechanisms.

**Materials and methods:**
Low dose streptozotocin and high fat diet induced diabetic mice were used for in studies, while primary ISCs were used in experiments. Podoplanin (PDPN) expression was manipulated using gene knockdown and overexpression techniques. Beta-cell function was assessed by insulin secretion and glucose tol- erance tests. Islet fibrosis was evaluated by quantifying extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and ISCs activation markers using histo- logical staining and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The effects of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and TGF-β1 on PDPN expression and the corresponding mechanisms of ISCs activation were investigated.

**Results:**
Knocking down PDPN in diabetes mice led to reduced ISCs activation and islet fibrosis, accompanied by improved insulin expres- sion and lower fasting blood glucose (11.20±2.18 vs. 17.53±1.88, P<0.05). AGEs were found to induce the PDPN expression in ISCs. The overexpression of PDPN triggers the activation of ISCs via cell deformation and TGF-β1 secretion. Interestingly, TGF-β1 in turn acti- vates the TGF-β1/SMAD2/3 pathway by binding to TGF-βRI, inducing the expression of PDPN and the activation of ISCs.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrated that PDPN regulates the activa- tion of ISCs through a mechanism involving cell deformation and a PDPN-TGF-β1 autocrine feedback loop, thereby significantly contrib- uting to the development of islet fibrosis in diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
The mechanistic target of rapamycin com- plex 1 (mTORC1) serves as a sensor of extracellular nutrients and intracellular energy status. mTORC1 activation in metabolic organs, such as the liver and the kidney, has been implicated in developing insulin resistance and diabetic kidney disease. However, the meta- bolic effects of intestinal mTORC1 activation have not been well elucidated. Besides, sex differences in mTOR signaling have been indicated in various tissues. In this study, we aimed to clarify the role of intestinal mTORC1 in regulating glucose metabolism and incretin secretion by employing gut epithelium-specific Tsc1 knockout (Tsc1- VKO) mice, in which mTORC1 signaling is constitutively activated in the intestinal epithelium.

**Materials and methods:**
Tsc1-VKO mice were generated by cross- breeding Tsc1-floxed mice with Villin-Cre transgenic mice using the Cre/loxP system. mTORC1 activation in the jejunum was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated S6 (p-S6), a downstream effector of mTORC1 signaling. Oral and Intraperito- neal glucose tolerance tests (OGTT and ipGTT) were performed to evaluate male and female mice’s blood glucose and plasma insulin levels. Incretin (GIP and GLP-1) secretion was examined following an oral glucose load (6 g/kg). To investigate the role of sex hormones in glucose metabolism, gonadectomies (orchiectomy in males and ovariectomy in females) or sham operations were conducted before OGTT.

**Results:**
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed robust p S6 expres- sion along the villus-crypt axis in the jejunum of Tsc1-VKO mice, confirming constitutive mTORC1 activation in the intestinal epithe- lium. Male Tsc1-VKO mice exhibited significantly reduced glucose excursions during ipGTT compared with controls (AUC: Tsc1-flox 27,725 ± 4,030 vs. Tsc1-VKO 22,674 ± 1,585 mg/dL·min; p = 0.02) with elevated plasma insulin levels (AUC: Tsc1-flox 63.7 ± 3.5 vs. Tsc1-VKO 89.4 ± 17.4 ng/mL·min; p = 0.03). During OGTT, glucose excursions were similarly reduced (AUC: Tsc1-flox 22,775 ± 1,559 vs. Tsc1-VKO 16,430 ± 1,156 mg/dL·min; p < 0.01), despite compa- rable insulin levels. Notably, the insulin-to-glucose ratio at 15 minutes trended higher in Tsc1-VKO mice (p = 0.056). Moreover, Tsc1-VKO mice showed a marked high GIP secretion (AUC: Tsc1-flox 14,760 ± 1,474 vs. Tsc1-VKO 38,177 ± 2,134 pmol/L·min; p = 0.0003), while GLP-1 levels remained unchanged. In contrast, female Tsc1-VKO mice had no significant differences in glucose or insulin levels, although their GIP secretion was similarly elevated (AUC: Tsc1-flox 7,852 ± 1,398 vs. Tsc1-VKO 22,879 ± 7,313 pmol/L·min; p = 0.0003). Further- more, orchiectomy partially attenuated the better glucose tolerance in male Tsc1-VKO mice (AUC: Tsc1-flox sham 30,509 ± 2,105, Tsc1-flox orchiectomy 25,093 ± 1,376, Tsc1-VKO sham 20,781 ± 1,077, Tsc1- VKO orchiectomy 24,747 ± 1,775 mg/dL·min), whereas ovariectomy in females had no significant effect.

**Conclusion:**
These findings demonstrate that intestinal mTORC1 acti- vation promotes GIP secretion and ameliorates glucose tolerance in a male-specific manner, potentially mediated by testicular function.

**Background and aims:**
GLP-2 is a gut-derived hormone secreted postprandially, playing a key role in intestinal growth, gastrointestinal motility, blood flow regulation, and bone metabolism. Here, we inves- tigated the metabolic, cardiovascular, and appetite-regulating effects of GLP-2 infusion in carriers of in vitro-confirmed, loss-of-function (LoF) variants from the Danish population-based Inter99 cohort and matched control individuals.

**Materials and methods:**
In a randomized, single-blind, placebo-con- trolled, crossover study, we subjected 10 (5 men, 5 women, age and BMI (mean±SD): 70±7.7 years and 26±2.88 kg/m ) heterozygous car- riers of LoF variants (V230A, R261C, T287M or W340F) and 10 age- and gender-matched controls (age and BMI: 69±5.5 years and 28±3.92 kg/m ) to three experimental sessions: a liquid mixed meal test of 1,894 kJ (MMT), iv. infusions of GLP-2 (2 pmol/kg/min) and saline, respectively. Throughout all sessions, participants rated their subjective sensations, including hunger, satiety, well-being and nausea, using visual analogue scales at predefined time points. At the end of the two infusions, we conducted an meal test.

**Results:**
The GLP-2 infusion resulted in plasma GLP-2 concentra- tions of (mean±SEM): 354±7.3 pmol/l (LoF) and 374±8.8 pmol/l (controls), with stable blood glucose at 5.4±0.03 mmol/l (LoF) and 5.4±0.04 mmol/l (controls). In LoF carriers, GLP-2 infusion had no significant effect on blood pressure, whereas in controls, it lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by ~13 mmHg (p=0.05) and ~8 mmHg (p=0.002), respectively, compared to saline. Additionally, in controls, GLP-2 infusion increased incremental GLP-1 levels by ~1.5 fold (p=0.02) as well as prospective food consumption scores while reducing satiety. However, food intake remained unchanged between the two infusion conditions in both groups. During the MMT, blood glucose levels were similar between the two groups (p=0.23), however, LoF carriers showed a blunted decrease in diastolic blood pressure (p=0.0006) and a reduced compensatory increase in heart rate (p=0.07) compared to controls. Moreover, LoF carriers reported greater hunger (p=0.02) and lower satiety (p=0.03) during the MMT compared to controls (Figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
Compared with matched healthy controls, LoF variant carriers exhibit an impaired blood pressure response to GLP-2 infusion, diminished postprandial hemodynamic adaptations and altered appetite sensations.

**Exploring associations between GLP-1, PYY and GIP levels with eating behaviour and hypothalamic volume in humans**

C. Bannon, P. ­Fletcher

1. Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge,
2. UK, Department of Psychiatry, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, University

**Background and aims:**
The hormones Glucose-dependent insu- linotropic polypeptide (GIP), Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptideYY (PYY) are secreted from enteroendocrine cells found scat- tered within the intestinal epithelium. GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists are now regularly used in weight management and PYY-based weight loss therapies are being developed. Receptors for these hormones are expressed in the hypothalamus, and the inferior tubular region, including the arcuate nucleus, has been established as a key brain area of satiety signalling in preclinical stud- ies, but limited data are available from human subjects. This study aimed to explore how gut hormone levels and volume of hypothalamic regions are related to eating behaviours in humans.

**Materials and methods:**
Fifty volunteers (n=27 lean, n=23 obese sub- jects) were recruited into the “Studying the Psychological and Intero- ceptive Contributions to Eating” (SPICE) study. Initially volunteers underwent bodyweight measurements and had blood samples taken before and 30 min after a solid ad libitum meal. Plasma PYY, inactive GLP-1 and GIP were measured via immunoassay (MSD). On a separate visit, participants underwent a 3Tesla MRI scan. ­T -weighted whole brain acquisitions were pre-processed and segmented to extract the whole hypothalamus and hypothalamic nuclei using an automated tool based on a deep convolutional neural network in FreeSurfer develop- ment version 7. Hypothalamic volume data were normalised to intrac- ranial volume (ICV). Subnuclei per hemisphere were segmented and labelled as the following: anterior-inferior, anterior-superior, posterior, tubular inferior and tubular superior. Psychometric questionnaires were taken to assess participant scores for emotional eating and cognitive restraint. Correlation analysis was assessed using spearman rank cor- relation coefficients.

**Results:**
Both fasting PYY and inactive GLP-1 levels showed a posi- tive correlation with cognitive restraint (p<0.05), but did not show significant association with BMI or emotional eating scores. Both normalised volumes for left and right tubular inferior hypothalamus, showed negative correlations with increases in total GIP and inactive GLP-1 in response to the meal (p<0.05). Both normalised volumes for left and right posterior hypothalamus positively correlated with BMI, but not gut hormone levels (p<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights an association between anorexigenic gut hormones GLP-1 and PYY in cognitive restraint, but not emotional eating behaviours. Further work is needed to explore the pathways involved in emotional eating and to further explore the observed rela- tionship of hypothalamic region volumes and postprandial gut hormone (GIP and GLP-1) excursions.

**The effect of GLP-1 receptor antagonists and agonists on islet func- tion in non-diabetic subjects with the GLP1R polymorphism at rs3765467**

1. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA, University of Padova, Padova,

**Background and aims:**
Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) interacts with its β-cell transmembrane receptor (GLP1R) to produce insu- lin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Previously the non- synonymous SNP (nsSNP) R131Q (rs3765467) in the locus has been associated with an increased insulin secretory response to infused GLP-1. Population based studies demonstrate an association with decreased fasting glucose and decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Although recent work has suggested that this nsSNP does not alter receptor-ligand binding affinity or cAMP production in response to GLP-1 binding, the recruitment of β-arrestin is decreased. These find- ings are increasingly relevant given the observation that intra-islet GLP-1 production supports α-cell and β-cell function in health and in diabetes. We aimed to assess the effect of rs3765467 on islet function in response to GLP1R blockade with exendin 9-39 or GLP1R agonism with liraglutide.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied 20 healthy individuals (age=45±5 years, BMI=27±1 kg/m , fasting glucose 5.1 ± 0.1 mmol/L) on three occasions in random order. Half of the subjects were heterozygous or homozygous for the minor allele (CT/TT) at rs3765467 while the remainder were homozygous for the major allele (CC). Subject groups were matched for age, BMI, sex and fasting glu- cose. On each occasion after an overnight fast, subjects were studied using a hyperglycemic clamp. A variable infusion maintained periph- eral glucose concentrations at 160 mg/dl for 180 minutes. On one occasion, saline was infused from -120 min to the end of the study (180 min - Saline Day); on another Exendin 9-39 was infused from -120 to 180 min @ 300pmol/kg/min (Exendin Day); on the other day liraglutide 0.6mg was administered by subcutaneous injection at -120 min (Liraglutide Day).

**Results:**
Liraglutide lowered fasting glucose significantly in both groups. GLP1R blockade with exendin 9-39 raised fasting glucose (Fig. 1, Panel A: One-way ANOVA (* < 0.05) and a Tukey’s test ( < 0.05) was used to determine within-group differences) and decreased fasting insulin secretion in subjects with 1 or 2 copies of the minor allele (CT/TT) at rs3765467. Exendin 9-39 did not alter fasting glucose in those with the CC genotype (Fig. 1, Panel B). No between group differences were observed during the hyperglycemic clamp in response to either exendin 9-39 or liraglutide.

**Conclusion:**
The T allele at rs3765467 increases responsiveness of GLP1R to its endogenous ligand. These effects are relevant to the fasting state and less apparent when the islet is stimulated by hyper- glycemia or liraglutide.

**Background and aims:**
After ingestion of a meal, blood supply to the digestive organs increases. In healthy individuals, the incretin hor- mone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), contributes to the increased splanchnic blood flow after the ingestion of glucose. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the insulinotropic effect of GIP is severely reduced. With the use of flow sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we investigated the effect of endogenous GIP on the regional splanchnic blood flow in patients with type 2 diabetes, expecting to see a reduced effect of the hormone GIP on the splanchnic blood flow.

**Materials and methods:**
Ten women/men (2/8) with type 2 diabe- tes (age 59-74 years, HbA1c 49-62 mmol/mol, BMI 23-35 kg/m ) participated in four randomized experiments in this crossover, single blinded, placebo controlled study on separate days: oral glucose + saline infusion, oral glucose + GIPR-An (GIP(3-30)NH 1,000 pmol/ kg/min), oral water + saline infusion, oral water + GIPR-An. Infusion was started at time -20 minutes. Blood flow in superior mesenteric artery, vena portae, truncus coeliacus, and arteria hepatica was meas- ured repeatedly in supine position with phase contrast MRI and blood samples were collected over a period of 115 minutes. Statistics were conducted on incremental area under the curve (iAUC). Numbers are presented as mean ±SD.

**Results:**
Blood flow in superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (p=0.047) and vena portae (p=0.049) was lower during oral glucose + GIPR-An compared to oral glucose + saline infusion. The mean peak blood flow of SMA was 150±11% during oral glucose + GIPR-An and 182±17% during oral glucose + saline infusion. Blood flow was unchanged in SMA and vena portae during oral water + saline infusion and oral water + GIPR-An. Plasma glucose was similar for oral glucose + GIPR-An and oral glucose + saline infusion (9,005±1,705 mmol/l*min vs 9,579±206 mmol/l*min, p=0.32). Correspondingly, there were no differences in C-peptide (67±28 nmol/l*min vs. 70±34 nmol/l*min, p=0.57) comparing oral glucose + GIPR-An and oral glucose + saline infusion.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the vasodilatory effect of GIP is preserved in patients with type 2 diabetes, despite the lack of significant glu- cometabolic effect. GIP receptor antagonism reduces the splanchnic blood flow of SMA and vena portae to the same extent as previously reported in healthy individuals.

**Background and aims:**
High doses of the gut hormone glucagon like peptide 2 (GLP-2) increase the splanchnic blood flow in humans. Here, we investigated the effect of a physiological dose of GLP-2 on splanch- nic blood flow with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the ability of two doses of a proposed GLP-2 receptor antagonist (GLP-2RAn) to block these effects. We expected an increase in splanchnic blood flow after injection of GLP-2 and a dose-dependent blockage induced by GLP-2RAn, GLP-2(3-33).

**Materials and methods:**
In a cross-over, single blinded, placebo controlled design, ten healthy fasting participants (7 women, 3 men; age 20-26 years) received on four separate occasions, in a randomized order, intravenous infusions and subcutaneous injections of: 4 nmol/ kg/min GLP-2RAn + 0.1 nmol/kg GLP-2; 1 nmol/kg/min GLP-2RAn + 0.1 nmol/kg GLP-2; saline + 0.1 nmol/kg GLP-2; saline infusion + saline injection. The infusions were started 20 minutes prior to the injections; phase-contrast MRI scans of splanchnic blood flow were conducted repeatedly throughout the study period (90 minutes). Plasma samples of glucose, GLP-2(1-33) and GLP-2(3-33) were collected and heart rate recorded. Differences in blood flow (baseline divided values) were evaluated with a linear mixed model (R Studio) after 25 minutes, in the period of steady state. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.

**Results:**
Mean plasma levels of GLP-2 following the three injec- tions all reached peak values of 54-75 pmol/l, the low dose of GLP- 2RAn reached 300±17 nmol/l during the steady-state period and high dose reached 1,000±71 nmol/l, while plasma glucose and heart rate remained stable throughout the experiments. Splanchnic blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery and portal vein were 57±17% (p<0.001) and 22±9% (p=0.001) higher after injection of GLP-2 compared to saline. In both doses, GLP-2RAn combined with GLP-2 resulted in lower blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery (low dose p=0.002, high dose=0.001) but not in the portal vein (p values > 0.1) compared to GLP-2 alone with no differences between the two doses.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, physiological concentrations of GLP-2 increase splanchnic blood flow in humans, suggesting that this is a physiological effect of GLP-2. Moreover, GLP-2-induced increase in superior mesenteric artery blood flow is effectively blocked by GLP- 2(3-33) leading to the conclusion that GLP-2(3-33) is a suitable GLP- 2RAn for human studies of GLP-2 physiology.

**Inactive GLP-1 concentrations are a better measure of gut GLP-1 secretion than total GLP-1 concentrations in the fasting state**

2. bridge, UK, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge,

**Background and aims:**
Total GLP-1 measurements are commonly used in population and physiological studies as a measure of gut GLP-1 release because they measure both active GLP-1(7-36amide) and its DPP4-inactivated form GLP-1(9-36amide). However, we showed previously that fasting total GLP-1 concentrations corre- late strongly with fasting glucagon, raising the possibility that this might be attributable to total GLP-1 assays also detecting GLP-1(1- 36amide), an inactive peptide produced from proglucagon processing in pancreatic alpha cells and co-secreted with glucagon. This study addressed whether measuring inactive GLP-1(9-36amide) provides a more reliable assessment of gut GLP-1 secretion than measuring total GLP-1.

**Materials and methods:**
The study used plasma samples (fasting and 30 mins post ingestion of an ad libitum solid meal) from 50 (n=27 lean, n=23 with obesity) human volunteers in the SPICE study (Studying the Psychological and Interoceptive Contributions to Eating). Sam- ples were assayed for total GLP-1 (MSD), inactive GLP-1(9-36amide) (MSD), PYY (MSD) and glucagon (Mercodia). Four participants were excluded from the analysis because of outlying values that may reflect assay interference and require further follow up.

**Results:**
In fasting samples from 46 participants, total GLP-1 con- centrations correlated strongly with glucagon ­(r =0.41, p<0.001), but only weakly with PYY ­(r =0.18, p=0.003), which is co-released with GLP-1 from intestinal L-cells. Fasting inactive GLP-1(9-36amide) concentrations, by contrast, correlated more strongly with PYY ­(r = 0.48, p<0.001), and showed no evidence of correlation with glucagon (p=0.89). Concerningly, total GLP-1 correlated poorly with inactive GLP-1 in fasting samples ­(r =0.06, p=0.09). In postprandial samples the total GLP-1 assay performed well, with post prandial concentration increments correlating well with those of PYY ­(r =0.74, p<0.001) and inactive GLP-1 ­(r = 0.69, p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Total GLP-1 assays should be used and interpreted with caution in fasting samples, due to cross-reactivity with high circulat- ing levels of pancreatic inactive GLP-1(1-36amide) secreted alongside glucagon from alpha cells. Inactive GLP-1 assays are more reliable for assessing gut-derived GLP-1 in the fasting state, and results correlate strongly with PYY, as expected. Both total and inactive GLP-1 assays reliably report gut-derived GLP-1 release in the fed state. Conclusions derived from total GLP-1 assays in fasting samples (such as whether GLP-1 receptor agonists inhibit endogenous GLP-1 release) may need revisiting, as the assay results may represent pancreatic rather than gut-derived GLP-1 molecular forms.

**Background and aims:**
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP- 1R) agonists are used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity by improving insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and lipid metabolism. Bromocriptine, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist also used for T2D treatment was shown to modulate GLP-1R levels in epididymal adipose tissue (EAT). We aim to investigate the synergistic effects of combining liraglutide (GLP-1R agonist) with bromocriptine, hypothesizing that bromocriptine enhances GLP-1 signaling in EAT.

**Materials and methods:**
Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats were fed a high- caloric diet (HCD) for 5 months and Wistar rats used as control. After 4 months on HCD, GK rats were divided into four groups: the vehicle group (DMSO) (60ul/day), a group treated with bromocriptine (5mg/ kg/day), a group treated with liraglutide (100μg/kg/ twice a day), and a combination group receiving both treatments (Br+Lira). Glycemic and lipid profiles were monitored over time, and samples of EAT and liver were collected for metabolic pathway analysis. Liver histology was also performed to assess lipid accumulation. Data is presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Depending on normal- ity assessment, data were analyzed using either an ordinary one-way ANOVA or a Kruskal-Wallis test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
Despite only the liraglutide group showing changes in caloric intake (p<0.05 vs liraglutide pretreatment), both liraglutide (p<0.0001 vs vehicle) and Br+Lira (p<0.005 vs vehicle) treatments reduce body weight gain, with a more pronounced effect in the liraglutide group. Fasting glycemia decreased in all treatment groups (p<0.001 vs vehi- cle); however, insulin sensitivity improved most in the Br+Lira group. Furthermore, plasma free fatty acids (FFA) levels were reduced in lira- glutide (p<0.01 vs wistar) and Br+Lira groups (p<0.05 vs wistar). The decrease in EAT mass in the combination group (p<0.05 vs vehicle) indicates that the drug combination may enhance lipid metabolism, which is further supported by increased Enoyl Coenzyme A hydratase, short chain, 1 (ECSH1) levels in EAT (p<0.05 vs vehicle) and lower plasma FFA levels. Additionally, the upregulation of GLUT4 in EAT in the Br+Lira group (p<0.05 vs vehicle), further supports improved glucose metabolism. Accordingly, hepatic fat accumulation was drasti- cally reduced in the combination group, despite reduced ECSH1 levels (p<0.05 vs vehicle). These observations suggest a shift in systemic metabolism that prioritizes lipid utilization in peripheral tissues.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, our findings suggest that combining liraglutide with bromocriptine provides additional benefits, highlighting its poten- tial as a promising approach for managing metabolic disorders.

**Background and aims:**
Postprandial hypoglycemia (PH) describe a condition of abnormal low blood glucose following a carbohydrate rich meal or beverage. Data on prevalence of PH during OGTT or daily life is limited, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Proposed mechanisms include a rapid glucose increase with excessive insulin secretion followed by a rapid decrease in blood glucose, or a prolonged insulin action after glucose ingestion. We evaluated these hypotheses by analyzing a large number of OGTT from clinical routine. Furthermore, we investigated the prevalence and severity of PH during daily life using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data of 1,511 prolonged 75 g-OGTT (180 min) of people without diabetes performed between 2012 and 2023 during clinical routine. Blood samples were taken before and 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after glucose ingestion. Insulin secre- tion and sensitivity were assessed using insulin- and C-peptide based indices. Additionally, individuals with PH were monitored for 14 days using Free style Libre Pro.

**Results:**
Among the 1,511 OGTT (966 women) mild hypoglycemia (< 70mg/dl) occurred in 25,6 % (n=387) and moderate hypoglyce- mia (< 54mg/dl) in 7,1 % (n = 107). Comparisons between individu- als with euglycemia (EUGL) and moderate hypoglycemia ­(Hypo ) showed comparable sex distribution, while the ­Hypo group was slightly older (EUGL median age=43y vs. 45y, p=0,02) and had a slightly lower HbA1c (median 5,4% vs. 5,5%, p=0,047). Although fasting glucose was lower in the ­Hypo -group (p <0,001) both groups reached peak glucose after 30min, and glucose increment was comparable. Insulin secretion was lower in the ­Hypo -group even in age-adjusted models (HOMA-B p < 0,001, AUC​ /AUC​ p<0,001). Insulin sensitivity assessed through Stumvoll-, Matsuda- and ­ISI indices was higher in the ­Hypo group (age adjusted all p<0,001). Sixteen individuals participated in the CGM study (11 women). Median age was 35y (IQR 30,5 - 46,75y) and median BMI 28,43kg/m² (IQR 25,71 - 32,1 kg/m²). The minimal measured glucose level was median 64 mg/dl (IQR 58 - 67 mg/dl). Thirteen individuals experienced mild hypoglycemia, but only 5 experienced PH (visually identified). Neither the severity of hypoglycemia during OGTT nor HbA1c levels correlated with frequency of PH in daily life (both p > 0.1).

**Conclusion:**
Postprandial hypoglycemia affects a significant number of patients in a university hospital’s endocrinology setting during pro- longed OGTT. Neither increment of blood glucose nor excessive insulin secretion seem to contribute substantially to this phenomenon. Persons experiencing PH showed notably higher insulin sensitivity, which may lead to better everyday glucose control, as reflected by lower HbA1c. Although everyday hypoglycemia episodes were common, postprandial episodes in daily life were infrequent and mostly mild, suggesting that PH during OGTT might aid metabolic stratification but appears less useful in predicting everyday postprandial hypoglycemia.

**Background and aims:**
Experimental and early clinical evidence suggest that endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) reduce insulin resistance (IR) and inflammatory markers. In this study, designed to evaluate changes in urinary albumin excretion in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), we evaluated the effects of combining zibo- tentan (zibo), a selective ERA, and dapagliflozin (dapa) on IR and inflammation markers.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed a biomarker analysis of the ZENITH-CKD trial, a randomized, double-blind, phase 2b study designed to assess the effects of 12 weeks treatment with fixed-dose zibo (0.25 or 1.5 mg) plus dapa 10 mg vs dapa 10 mg alone. Patients aged 18-90 with CKD, with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D), eGFR ≥20 mL/min/1.73m², urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 150-5000 mg/g, and stable renin-angiotensin system blockade were eligible. Changes from baseline in IR (calculated with the homeostatic model assessment HOMA2-IR) and in the inflammatory biomarkers MCP-1, IL-6, and hsCRP were analyzed. Insulin users (n=109) were excluded.

**Results:**
A total of 237 patients were analyzed (138 without and 99 with T2D). Baseline parameters were balanced. Median HOMA2-IR was 3.0 (IQR 2.1-4.3); median MCP-1, IL-6, and hsCRP were 0.9 pg/mL (IQR 0.7-1.5), 146.0 pg/mL (IQR 118.4-180.2), and 1.3 mg/L (IQR 0.6-3.6), respectively. Both zibo/dapa 0.25/10 mg and 1.5/10 mg significantly reduced HOMA2-IR—with larger reductions than pla- cebo/dapa (Table 1). The effects were consistent irrespective of T2D (p for interaction 0.153). For inflammatory markers, the 1.5/10 mg combination significantly reduced all markers of inflammation, with significant decreases in MCP-1 and IL-6 versus placebo/dapa (Table 1). The 0.25/10 mg combination significantly reduced IL-6 versus placebo/ dapa but not MCP-1 or hsCRP (Table 1).

**Conclusion:**
We demonstrated that combination treatment with zibo- tentan/dapagliflozin reduces IR, while the 1.5/10mg zibotentan/dapa- gliflozin combination consistently reduced markers of inflammation. These beneficial effects may contribute to long-term kidney and cardio- vascular protective effects. The ZENITH-HP trial is currently ongoing to assess the long-term effects of a fixed low-dose zibotentan/dapagli- flozin treatment on eGFR decline and CKD related clinical outcomes.

**Insulin-mediated transcriptional responsiveness and resistance of human adipose tissue involves adipocytes and other cell types**

I. Yairi, E. Yeger-Lotem, A. Rudich

**Background and aims:**
The main physiological responses of adipose tissue to insulin are mediated by this tissue’s specialized cell-type - the adipocyte. Yet, all cells express insulin receptor and signaling appara- tus, and tissues’ responses to hormones typically engage coordinated responsiveness of different cell-types comprising the tissue. Here we hypothesized that insulin elicits cell-type specific responses in human adipose tissues, which may be uniquely affected by adipose tissue insu- lin sensitivity vs. resistance.

**Materials and methods:**
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA- seq) was used to investigate cell-type specific “architecture” of the insulin signaling cascade and how it is altered by insulin resistance. Ex-vivo insulin stimulation of adipose tissue explants (100 nM, 2h), followed by snRNA-seq was used to assess insulin-mediated transcrip- tional changes at single-cell resolution.

**Results:**
We applied snRNA-seq to 13 visceral (VAT) and 8 subcu- taneous adipose tissue (SAT) samples from 3 male and 10 female donors of different ages, BMI, and insulin sensitivity levels. 95,195 nuclei passed quality control in VAT and 58,521 in SAT, and included adipocytes, adipose progenitors (ASPC), immune, endothelial, and mesothelial cells. RNA expression of genes involved in the insulin signaling cascade across cell types uncovered cell-type-differential “architectures”, with adipocytes, expectedly, being the most distinct cell type. Proximal insulin signaling genes (from to ) var- ied between cell-types mainly by expression of different paralogs. Distal signaling components revealed genes of pathways related to metabolic functions such as anti-lipolysis and lipogenesis predomi- nantly in adipocytes, in SAT more than in VAT, while protein syn- thesis also in non-adipocytes, particularly mesothelial, endothelial and immune cells. Comparing insulin sensitive to resistant donors exhibited positive and negative correlations of HOMA-IR with mac- rophages and lymphatic endothelial cells (r=0.69, adjusted-Pv = 0.02 and r=-0.57, adjusted-Pv=0.04), respectively. Differential expression analysis in VAT between samples sensitive and resistant donors (adj. p. value<0.05, above 2-fold change) revealed transcriptional change in all cell types including non-adipocytes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in adipocytes were enriched to terms related to lipid metabolism in IR donors, while ASPC and endothelial cells’ DEGs were enriched to apoptosis mechanisms and extracellular compo- nents. Ex-vivo stimulation of VAT explants (n=4) showed that insu- lin changed most responsive genes (2-fold change) in a cell-type specific manner, with the highest correlated responsive genes seen between adipocytes, ASPCs and mesothelial cells. Remarkably, all cell types exhibited diminished transcriptional response to insulin in insulin resistant donors, shifting from predominantly insulin-induced to mainly insulin-suppressed genes.

**Conclusion:**
Transcriptional responsiveness of human adipose tissues to insulin engages multiple cell-types and occurs in a cell-type specific manner. Insulin resistance alters the responsiveness of multiple adipose tissue cell-types, beyond adipocytes.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin resistance is a major driver of type 2 diabetes (T2D), yet effective treatments for insulin resistance remain limited. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) is a co-receptor of the canonical WNT signalling. Genome-wide asso- ciation studies (GWAS) have identified WNT signalling molecules, including variant in , , and to be associated with measures of glucose and lipid metabolism and risk of T2D. How- ever, the precise role of WNT signalling in skeletal muscle metabolism remains unclear. We aimed to identify potential abnormalities in insulin signalling and the transcriptional response to insulin in skeletal muscle in individuals with a gain-of-function (GOF) LRP5 (T253I) mutation, which is linked to high bone mass (HBM).

**Materials and methods:**
Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from 13 individuals with the HBM LRP5 (T253I) mutation and 14 healthy age-, sex- and BMI-matched controls, both before and after a euglyce- mic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (3 hours, 40 mU/min/m²). We investigated key mediators of insulin signalling involved in glucose transport and glycogen synthesis, including the protein abundance/phosphorylation of Akt2, TBC1D4, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3α and ß) and Erk1/2 and performed bulk RNA sequencing in skeletal muscle.

**Results:**
At baseline, there were no differences in fasting plasma glu- cose, HbA1c levels or body composition between HBM LRP5 mutation carriers and controls. Insulin sensitivity measured as insulin-mediated glucose disposal during clamp was significantly reduced in LRP5 muta- tion carriers compared with controls (P<0.05). However, no differences in the basal or insulin-stimulated protein abundance or phosphoryla- tion of Akt2, TBC1D4, GSK3 (α and ß) or Erk1/2 in muscle were found between LRP5 mutation and controls. RNA-sequencing revealed 1,648 muscle genes (837 upregulated and 811 down regulated) that significantly responded to insulin controls. In LRP5 mutation carriers, insulin only changed the expression of 916 muscle genes (468 upregu- lated and 448 down regulated). Importantly, LRP5 mutation carriers showed diminished insulin response compared with controls. Func- tional enrichment analysis revealed reduced transcriptional activation of PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, and protein phosphorylation regulation in LRP5 mutation carriers.

**Conclusion:**
Despite comparable baseline characteristics between groups, our findings suggest that WNT signalling negatively regulates insulin action and contributes to insulin resistance in LRP5-HBM indi- viduals, with transcriptional alterations detectable in skeletal muscle. However, these changes are not attributed to defects in the canonical insulin signalling cascade at the phosphorylation level in skeletal mus- cle. Instead, the GOF LRP5 mutation may impair insulin sensitivity through alternative, non-canonical mechanisms, which remain to be determined.

**Background and aims:**
Lactate and ketone bodies (particularly β-hydroxybutyrate, BHB) are important mitochondrial fuels and signal- ling molecules that impact glucose and lipid metabolism. We have stud- ied oral administration of (S)-lactate and (R)-1,3-butanediol, a novel lactate-ketone ester (LaKe), to test the metabolic effects of elevated lactate and BHB concentrations in obese individuals.

**Materials and methods:**
In a double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover study, 10 healthy participants with obesity received 28-day LaKe and 28-day taste-matched noncaloric placebo regimens of 2 daily doses (25 mL/dose) separated by a 28-day washout period. After each intervention period, participants were studied after an overnight fast before consuming the allocated intervention and undergoing a hyper- insulinemic euglycemic clamp.

**Results:**
We included 10 healthy participants with obesity (5 men; 44±7 years of age; all caucasian). After consuming LaKe, lactate and BHB-concentrations peaked at 2.15 mM (IQR: 1.5-2.65) and 0.6 mM (IQR: 0.5-0.7), respectively. Overall insulin sensitivity ( -value) increased after LaKe dosing (4.57±1.57 mg/kg/min versus 3.58±1.16 mg/kg/min, =0.02) with a significant Treatment × Time interaction effect for the glucose infusion rate (GIR, <0.001). The 28-days con- sumption of LaKe resulted in slightly lower fasting plasma glucose (5.29 ± 0.31 mM versus 5.64 ± 0.43 mM, =0.07), while body weight (112 ± 23.5 kg versus 111.2 ± 23.2 kg, =0.13) remained unchanged.

**Conclusion:**
Twenty-eight days consumption of LaKe improved insu- lin sensitivity in individuals with obesity. These findings suggest that supplementation with exogenous lactate and ketones may enhance metabolic health in individuals with obesity while also highlighting its potential benefits for those with type 2 diabetes. Further research is warranted to explore its long-term effects and underlying mechanisms.

**Background and aims:**
Methylglyoxal (MG) is a key precursor of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), contributes to diabetes and its microvascular complications. MG is primarily detoxified by the gly- oxalase system (GLO1 & GLO2), with additional contributions from aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and aldo-keto reductases (AKRs). Previous studies showed that MG levels were only moderately elevated in GLO1 knockout (KO) zebrafish, while in AKR1A1A KO led to increased acrolein (ACR), but not MG. In GLO1-deficient Schwann cells, AKR-mediated MG detoxification was found to be enhanced, suggesting a compensatory role. However, whether AKR1A1A specifi- cally compensates for GLO1 loss remains unclear. This study aimed to address this by generating GLO1/AKR1A1A double knockout (DKO) zebrafish and assessing MG/ACR accumulation, glucose metabolism and potential mechanistic pathways.

**Materials and methods:**
To examine whether the compensatory role of AKR1A1A in MG detoxification, we generated GLO1/AKR1A1A DKO zebrafish. MG and ACR levels were quantified in DKO, WT, GLO KO and AKR1A1A KO zebrafish. Comprehensive metabolic pro- filing included targeted metabolomics using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (UPLC-FLR) or semi- targeted GC-MS, transcriptomics via the BGI platform, and glucose metabolism assessment using a commercial kit and RT-qPCR. AKT phosphorylation levels were quantified by western blot analysis.

**Results:**
GLO1/AKR1A1A DKO larvae exhibited significantly elevated MG and ACR levels. DKO zebrafish also showed marked hyperglycemia, with higher whole-body glucose levels in larvae and elevated 2-hour postprandial blood glucose in adults. Metabolomics analysis revealed pronounced alterations in arginine metabolism, with DKO larvae and adult liver tissues showing the lowest arginine levels among all groups. Transcriptomics analysis indicated downregulation of insulin signaling pathways in DKO larvae. Arginine supplementation (75 μM) successfully normalized whole-body glucose in DKO larvae, improved insulin sensitivity via enhanced AKT phosphorylation, and ameliorated glucose dysregulation.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrate the GLO1 and ARK1A1A are essential for detoxifying MG and ACR and maintaining meta- bolic homeostasis. Their combined loss disrupts arginine metabo- lism and impairs insulin signaling, leading to glucose dysregulation. These results highlight a compensatory role for ARK1A1A in MG detoxification and identify arginine pathways as a potential therapeutic target.

**Background and aims:**
Impairment in insulin sensitivity (IS) and met- abolic flexibility (MetFlex) are the key pathophysiological mechanisms in the development of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disturbances associated with obesity. Whether these two parameters are related and which of them is the first manifestation of metabolically unhealthy phenotype remains controversial. The aim of our study was to compare the parameters of IS and MetFlex in a group of lean women and women with obesity and analyze their relation to the ectopic fat distribution and characteristics of glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respira- tion in the skeletal muscle.

**Materials and methods:**
25 women with obesity (OB, age 37 ± 6, BMI 35.9 ± 4.7) and 21 women with normal weight (NW, age 32 ± 5, BMI 21.4 ± 1.5) were investigated: anthropometry, blood sam- pling, exercise testing, and hepatic fat and muscle fat content analysis (magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy) was performed. IS and Metflex were analysed in two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (HEC, 10 and 40mIU/m2) and glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with indirect calorimetry (ΔRQ). Skeletal muscle biopsy was performed to analyze mitochondrial respiration (O2K, Oroboros).

**Results:**
OB had higher adiposity and ectopic fat accumulation (hepatic fat content 5.2±4.6 vs. 0.9±0.4%, p=0.001, intramuscular fat 120±42 vs 36±14 ­cm , p=0.001), and lower cardiorespiratory fitness ­(VO 22.0±4.1 vs 40.2±5.8 ml.kg min , p=0.001) and insulin sen- sitivity (4.9 ± 2.2 vs 11.0 ± 2.1 mg.kg min , p=0.001), when compared to NW. The mitochondrial respiratory capacity, ATP production and fatty acid oxidation in the muscle was lower in OB. However, the groups did not differ in the degree of MetFlex measured as ΔRQ during hyperin- sulinemic euglycemic clamp or during OGTT (ΔRQ 0.13±0.14 vs 0.16±0.19, p=0.620, ΔRQ 0.09±0.07 vs 0.07±0.06, p=0.475). In the entire group of women IS correlated positively with ­VO (p<0.001, r=0.84), mitochondrial respiratory capacity (p<0.001, r=0.61), ATP production (p=0.003, r=0.52) and fatty acids oxidation (p=0.003, r=0.53), and negatively with ectopic fat accumulation (hepatic fat p<0.001, r=-0.73, intramuscular fat p<0.001, r=-0.71). However, no correlation of IS with MetFlex (ΔRQ , ΔRQ ) was present. On the other hand ΔRQ during the clamp correlated positively with maximal lactate levels during exercise stress test (p=0.03, r=0.35).

**Conclusion:**
Our results suggest that impaired IS precedes measur- able changes in MetFlex, and these two variables are not correlated in our group of women. Whole-body IS significantly correlates with ectopic fat accumulation and mitochondrial respiratory capacity in muscle while MetFlex seems to be associated with anaerobic glucose metabolism in the muscle.

**Background and aims:**
Lipid metabolism disorders, together with the accumulation of lipids and their lipotoxic metabolites, may contrib- ute to the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. They may reduce insulin action, impair glucose utilization, or activate pro- inflammatory and pro-oxidant pathways. However, the precise effect of individual lipids and their lipotoxic intermediates is unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of skeletal muscle lipid profile on the development of insulin resistance in a prediabetic model - hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (HHTg) rats. Parameters of insulin sensitivity were compared with the results of skeletal muscle lipidomic analysis and with relative gene expression of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.

**Materials and methods:**
In the study was used adult male rats of HHTg strain, a model of metabolic syndrome with insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and severe dyslipidaemia but without obe- sity and fasting hyperglycaemia. The control group consisted of age- matched male of Wistar rats. Skeletal muscle lipidomic analysis were evaluated by tandem mass spectrometry method.

**Results:**
Compared to controls, HHTg rats exhibited markedly increased serum triglycerides, chronically elevated NEFA and impaired glucose tolerance during oGTT. Impaired insulin sensitivity param- eters in muscle in HHTg strain were associated with triglycerides (p<0.001) and 1,3 diacylglyceroles (p<0.001) accumulation and in particular, with significant increase in individual ceramides (18:0, 22:0, 24:0, 24:1) (p<0.001) in muscle. Increased mRNA expression of , an enzyme involved in ceramide biosynthesis, may con- tribute to their muscle accumulation. In addition, decreased palmitate oxidation measured according to radioactively labelled substrate was observed in HHTg animals compared to controls. Lipidomic analysis in skeletal muscle in HHTg rats revealed significant reductions in specific membrane phospholipids and lysophospholipids: phosphatidylethano- lamines (PE41:2), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC22:6) and lysophos- phatidylethanolamines (LPE20:0) with very long fatty acid chains, which may reduce insulin signaling in skeletal muscle. Decreased mRNA expression of and may contribute to reduction in phospholipids. Based on lipidomic analysis, increased phosphatidylch oline:phosphatidylethanolamine ratio may be involved in mitochondria dysfunction that can worsen insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle in HHTg animals.

**Conclusion:**
In a prediabetic model, diacylglyceroles and ceramides accumulation together with a decrease in specific phospholipids and lysophospholipids contribute to insulin resistance development in skeletal muscle independently of obesity and before diabetes onset. Reduced fatty acid oxidation and increased ceramide biosynthesis can contribute to lipid accumulation. Both lipotoxic diacylglyceroles and ceramides can impair muscle insulin signaling, however, the ceramide accumulation is more pronounced.

**Background and aims:**
Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) often face severe comorbidities such as diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and mental health complications like anxiety. A key mechanism involved in the development of T2DM and its related conditions is insulin resist- ance. Enhancing insulin sensitivity is therefore a viable strategy to hinder progression of T2DM and its comorbidities. SH2-containing 5’-inositol phosphatase (SHIP2) suppresses the insulin signaling path- way and is upregulated in T2DM, contributing to disease progression. Thus, inhibiting SHIP2 activity offers a promising approach to mitigate T2DM development and associated comorbidities.

**Materials and methods:**
We assessed the impact of SHIP2 on the development of T2DM, DKD and behavioral changes in diabetes using transgenic mice expressing catalytically inactive SHIP2 ­(SHIP2 ). T2DM in mice was modeled by combining high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin injections, while control mice received a low-fat diet and citrate buffer injections. Metabolic phenotyping was performed using insulin and glucose tolerance tests, alongside serum lipid profiling. Glucose uptake in tissues of diabetic mice was assessed by ­[ F]Fluoro- 2-deoxyglucose ­([ F]FDG) biodistribution measurement, cor- roborated by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans. Kidney function alterations were evaluated by total urine volume and albumin-creatinine ratio. Finally, we investigated the impact of SHIP2 catalytic inactivation on T2DM-associated mental disorders through behavioral tests, including the light-dark box and social interaction tests.

**Results:**
We found that catalytic inactivation of SHIP2 led to reduced fasting blood glucose level (n=8-12, p=0.04), improved glucose tol- erance (n=6-12, p=0.01), and enhanced insulin sensitivity (n=6-12, p=0.01) in diabetic mice. ­[ F]FDG biodistribution meas- urement showed increased glucose uptake in the muscle of diabetic ­SHIP2 mice compared to diabetic wild-type ­SHIP2 mice (n= 3-5, p=0.003). Serum lipid analysis demonstrated decreased triglyc- eride levels (n=5-8, p=0.01) and improved levels of total cholesterol (n=5-8, diabetic vs. control ­SHIP2 p=0.002; SHIP2 p = NS) and NEFA levels in diabetic ­SHIP2 mice with improved NEFA levels also observed in diabetic heterozygous ­SHIP2 mice (n=5-8, diabetic vs. control ­SHIP2 p=0.001; SHIP2 ; SHIP2 p = NS). Diabetic ­SHIP2 mice exhibited lower total urine volume (n=8-12, p=0.04) and albumin-creatinine ratio (n=6-10, p=0.04) compared to diabetic wild-type mice. Behavioral tests revealed decreased unconditioned anx- iety in diabetic heterozygous ­SHIP2 mice (n=10-15, p=0.05) and improved social behavior in diabetic ­SHIP2 mice (n=6-8, p=0.04), relative to their diabetic wild-type peers.

**Conclusion:**
Catalytic inactivation of SHIP2 improves overall meta- bolic health, mitigates signs of DKD development, and alleviates anxi- ety symptoms in diabetic mice.

**Background and aims:**
The long-term effects of chronic exposure to pharmacological levels of recombinant fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) on cardiac function remain controversial. While several stud- ies support a protective role of FGF21 in diabetic cardiomyopathy, oth- ers have reported that FGF21 increases cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We investigated the prolonged exposure to FGF21 on cardiac metabolism and function in db/db mice with established diabetes using an engi- neered adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) expressing FGF21 (AAV-FGF21) under a liver-specific promoter.

**Materials and methods:**
We administered a single dose of AAV8- FGF21 or an empty AAV vector (AAV-control) to 10-week-old female db/db mice (n=13 per group, 1 × 10¹¹ vg/mouse) and followed them for 20 weeks. Body weight was monitored weekly, and glucose and insulin levels and cardiac glucose utilization rate was assessed using [³H]2- deoxyglucose at the end of the treatment period. Transthoracic echocar- diography was performed at the study’s conclusion using a Vevo2100 imaging system equipped with an MS400 solid-state transducer, both with and without a dobutamine challenge.

**Results:**
At 30 weeks of age, AAV control-treated mice gained significantly more weight and exhibited severe hyperglycemia com- pared to mice. The glucose utilization rate of the AAV-control treated mouse myocardium was significantly lower than that of controls, indicating profound cardiac insulin resistance. AAV- FGF21 treatment markedly suppressed weight gain and reversed the development of diabetes in db/db mice, as evidenced by close to nor- malized glucose levels measured at the end of study period. A robust increase in pancreatic insulin content was also observed compared to AAV-control treated mice. Furthermore, AAV-FGF21 protected mice from hypertrophy of the heart as suggested by significant lower heart weight/tibia, left ventricle mass as well as myocardial insulin resistance, which is accompanied by parameters indicative for improved diastolic function as reflected by reduced deceleration time and E/e’.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that chronic exposure of pharmaco- logical levels of FGF21 (176±39ng/ml, day 14 post dosing) produced by AAV8-FGF21 suppress weight gain and diabetes, attenuate cardiac insulin resistance, and ultimately reduce the development of cardiac hypertrophy in mice.

**Background and aims:**
Finnish-specific variant, p.P50T/ (Minor Allele Frequency- 1.1%) of the insulin signaling target AKT2, is associ- ated with insulin resistance and increased risk for type 2 diabetes. We have previously reported multiple differentially phosphorylated kinase substrates in primary myotubes established from p.P50T/ carri- ers (kinome profiling). Further upstream kinase analysis pre- dicted a large-scale impairment in activities of different kinases, such as the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKα1), which was predicted to have reduced activity in variant carriers. As data from knockout mice suggest that AKT2 regulates skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose metabolism via AMPK, we have studied here if AMPK-signaling and mitochondrial respiration are affected in skeletal muscle cells from p.P50T/ variant carriers.

**Materials and methods:**
Study cohort included 7 men (56.6 ± 2.2 years (mean ± SE), BMI 28.2 ± 1.4 kg ­m ) with p.P50T/ variant (carriers) and 7 BMI-matched men with wild-type (non-carriers) (65.0 ± 1.3 years ( < 0.01 vs carriers), BMI 27.9 ± 0.7 kg ­m )). Compared to non-carriers, variant carriers had reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp combined with ( F-FDG)-PET (15.5 ± 1.6 μmol ­kg min vs 40.0 ± 5.0 μmol ­kg min , < 0.001). Primary muscle cell cultures were established from muscle biopsies. Myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes which were treated with 1 mM 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribo- nucleoside (AICAR) for 18 h. Phosphorylation of AMPKα-Thr and expression of five oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes were detected by western blotting. Mitochondrial respiration was assessed with Seahorse XFe96 analyzer.

**Results:**
Treatment with AICAR led to significant phosphorylation of AMPKα-Thr in primary myotubes from both non-carriers and p.P50T/ carriers ( < 0.001), with the effect of AICAR blunted in carriers ( < 0.05). Basal, maximal and ATP-linked respiration (in pmol ­min μg ) were similar in myotubes from non-carriers (basal, 3.16 ± 0.49, maximal 6.10 ± 0.95 and ATP-linked respiration 3.03 ± 0.45) and p.P50T/ carriers (basal 3.77 ± 0.32 ( = 0.32), maximal 6.58 ± 0.48 ( = 0.66) and ATP-linked respiration 2.86 ± 0.54 ( = 0.82)). Exposure to AICAR led to a reduction in basal mitochondrial respiration (to 2.23 ± 0.39 and to 2.76 ± 0.32, in non-carriers and car- riers, respectively, < 0.01 for both) and ATP-linked respiration (to 1.83 ± 0.45 and to 1.90 ± 0.44, in non-carriers and carriers, respec- tively, < 0.05 for both). Maximal respiration was reduced in response to AICAR (to 4.29 ± 0.63 and to 5.59 ± 0.63, in non-carriers and carriers, respectively) which was statistically significant only in non- carriers ( < 0.01). Basal expression of the five OXPHOS complexes was similar in the two groups.

**Conclusion:**
The effect of AICAR to increase AMPKα-Thr phos- phorylation and to inhibit maximal respiration is blunted in primary myotubes from p.P50T/ carriers, suggesting impaired AMPK signaling.

5. University, Prague, Czechia, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles

**Background and aims:**
The validity of hyperinsulinemic-euglyce- mic clamp (HEC) as the gold standard for assessing insulin sensitiv- ity, is based on assumption of adequate suppression of endogenous insulin secretion. A ≥50% reduction in C-peptide from baseline was used as an indicator of sufficient suppression. However, a wide distri- bution of C peptide suppression has been described in the literature and the causes are not fully elucidated. The aim of this study is to investigate C peptide suppression in available clamps and to see if it can be influenced by volunteer characteristics or clamp conduct.

**Materials and methods:**
We retrospectively analysed 255 HEC per- formed at our institution (40 mIU/m²/min,120 minutes). Suppres- sion was defined as percentage decrease in C-peptide (steady state - baseline) and correlated with 1/ baseline patient characteristics (age, sex, BMI, body fat percentage, fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR), and 2/ clamp procedure indices (0-120min: mean glucose, Δglucose , glucose variability, and time in range), and 3/ clamp-derived insulin sensitivity indices (M-value, MCR).

**Results:**
C-peptide suppression was >50% in 25% of clamps, <50% in 56%, and paradoxically increased in 19%. Baseline character- istics generally did not predict the C peptide suppression. Clamp procedural associated with suppression included steady-state glu- cose levels ( =0.4821, <0.0001) and glucose infusion rate slope ( =-0.2693, <0.0001), with higher difference in glucose concen- trations and steeper infusion rate increases leading to lower sup- pression. A higher M-value correlated with lower suppression ( =0.2274, =0.0003), suggesting potential overestimation of insulin sensitivity in cases of insufficient suppression.

**Conclusion:**
C-peptide suppression serves as a meaningful marker for assessing the validity of HEC conduct and should be routinely incorporated into clamp protocols. Maintaining glucose levels close to baseline and avoiding rapid increases in glucose infusion rate are critical to ensure adequate C-peptide suppression. Failure to do so may result in incomplete suppression of endogenous insulin secre- tion, compromising clamp accuracy and leading to overestimated insulin sensitivity measurements.

**The haematocrit directly affects blood glucose in mice: Are erythrocytes glucose carriers?**

C. Fürnsinn, T. Scherer

**Background and aims:**
Blood glucose is lower in mountain than lowland dwellers, which could result from diminished partial oxygen pressure at high altitude. Aiming to understand if and via what mecha- nism life under hypoxia affects glucose homeostasis, the present study revealed a direct and immediate influence of the hematocrit on blood glucose.

**Materials and methods:**
Male mice with obesity induced by high fat diet were for several weeks maintained under isobaric hypoxia (10% ­O ) or treated with erythropoietin (EPO; 3 weekly injections of 300 U/ kg). Chow-fed lean mice were treated with the hemolytic phenylhydra- zine (PHZ; 2 weekly injections of 15-20 mg/kg). To exclude indirect action via appetite and weight, control groups were fed restrictedly so to obtain weight curves comparable to their treated counterparts.

**Results:**
Exposure to hypoxia increased the hematocrit of obese mice (55±1 44±1%), which was accompanied by improvements in basal glycemia (7.2±0.2 9.1±0.3 mmol/l, p<0.001), glucose tolerance (AUC: 1.73±0.07 2.19±0.07 mol/l*min, p<0.001), and insulin sensitivity (HOMA: 16±1 36±5, p<0.001; confirmed in eugly- cemic clamp test). Treatment with EPO had a similar effect (hema- tocrit 69±1 44±1%; basal glucose: 6.0±0.5 9.2±0.4 mmol/l, p<0.001; AUC, 1.56±0.08 2.47±0.05 mol/l*min, p<0.001; HOMA: 8±1 45±11; p=0.007). According responses were confirmed also in female and lean mice. A clear line of evidence showed that glucose low- ering was a direct consequence of the rising hematocrit: (i) Over time, the slow EPO-induced fall in blood glucose accurately mirrored the progressive rise in the hematocrit. (ii) Glucose lowering by hypoxia or EPO was unimpaired in mice expressing the EPO receptor only in the hematopoietic lineage, which excluded a role for direct EPO action on gluco-regulatory tissues (basal glucose: hypoxia, 4.7±0.4 9.3±0.6; EPO, 5.3±0.5 8.8±0.2 mmol/l; p<0.001 each). (iii) A PHZ-induced fall in the hematocrit of lean mice (24±1 45±1%) went along with increased glycemia (8.5±0.6 6.3±0.3 mmol/l, p=0.01; AUC, 1.49±0.02 1.22±0.07 mol/l*min, p=0.007) despite a huge com- pensatory rise in endogenous EPO (168±26 6±2 ng/l, p<0.001). (iv) Raising the hematocrit from 46±1 to 60±1% by blood transfusion caused a concomitant decrease in blood glucose (7.4±0.2 9.3±0.3 mmol/l, p<0.001; AUC 2 h after infusion, 1.18±0.07 1.47±0.08 mol/l*min, p=0.02). In search for the mechanism connecting the hematocrit with blood glucose, we hypothesized that red blood cells, which are capable of glycogen storage, may act as carriers of glucose units and thereby reduce the amount of free glucose detectable in the blood. The larger mass of erythrocytes collected from 200 μl blood of EPO-treated control mice indeed took up more than twice the amount of glucose, when incubated under high glucose (22 mmol/l; 508±111 vs 258±78 nmol, p=0.04). , red blood cells from EPO-treated mice released more glucose into the incubation medium, when exposed to low glucose (1.1 mmol/l; 217±16 155±10 nmol, p=0.01).

**Conclusion:**
Taken together, we show that the hematocrit is a signifi- cant modulator of blood glucose, which could at least in part be due to erythrocytes acting as carriers of glucose units in the blood. Our results provide a rationale for associations between hematocrit and blood glucose as observed in humans not only at high-altitude, but also in association with anti-anemic therapy, polycythemia, and smoking.

**Background and aims:**
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine hormone with broad metabolic actions at supraphysiological concentrations, but its physiological function is not clear. Recent data also suggest a link to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress. ER-stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), and the integrated stress response (ISR), cellular repair mechanisms instrumental in maintain- ing cellular homeostasis during protein folding stress. We investigated the intracellular signaling actions of FGF21 using APEX2 proximity labeling.

**Materials and methods:**
We used APEX2 proximity labeling followed by LC-MS proteomics to assess the intracellular signaling actions of FGF21 at its receptor β-klotho (KLB) in human cells. We measured ­H S and persulfide levels in human cells, mouse liver, and fresh liver slices, and assessed ER-stress and the UPR using Western Blot and qPCR. We assessed in-vivo action of FGF21 pharmacologically in wild-type and liver specific KLBKO mice and using global FGF21KO mice for physiological FGF21 levels.

**Results:**
We discovered FGF21-dependent enrichment of proteins linked to protein folding in the ER, ER-stress, and ­H S production at the FGF21-receptor KLB. Investigating actions of FGF21 on ER- stress in cells and mouse liver, we found that FGF21 increases sulfide signaling and enhances, but crucially does not initiate the UPR, and that this action is blunted by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of sulfide signaling and phenocopied by an ­H S-donor . Strikingly, we found that even physiological levels of FGF21 modulate the UPR via increased hepatic ­H S production and that these actions of FGF21 require KLB.

**Conclusion:**
Our data identify a novel physiological role of FGF21 as an endocrine hormone of protein folding stress that reduces ER-stress by enhancing, but not activating the UPR via sulfide signaling, and indicate that sulfide signaling is a core second messenger of the UPR.

**Background and aims:**
An imbalance between energy intake and expenditure can result in either obesity or malnutrition. Anorexia ner- vosa is characterized by severe reduction in food intake and weight, often associated with increased physical activity. Despite this, patients maintain normal glycemia levels and a minimal body weight essential for their survival, suggesting significant metabolic adaptations to main- tain energy homeostasis. Furthermore, a dysbiosis is recently observed in both anorexia nervosa patients and in the mouse model. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the intestinal microbiota plays a role in glycemic control under food restriction.

**Materials and methods:**
We used two groups of C57BL/6J mice (AL, FR). The AL group had ad libitum access to food, serving as our con- trol group. The FR group (food restriction) underwent a 30% reduction in food intake for 3 days, followed by 50% reduction for 3 weeks, then we performed metabolic tests. Cecal content was collected at the end of the protocol and then transferred to free-fed mice, after which we conducted metabolic tests.

**Results:**
Mice under food restriction performed lower glycemia increase after pyruvate and glutamine injection, showing reduced gluconeogenesis ability in respectively liver and intestine (AUC: AL 14555 ± 377 and FR 9241 ± 688 (mg/min*dL); ANOVA p < 0.0001 AL vs. FR), despite the upregulation of genes of key gluconeogenesis enzymes in the liver (Student-t-test p<0.01) and intestines (Student- t-test p<0.05). Moreover, the findings revealed a significant increased glucose tolerance among FR mice (AUC: AL 21373 ± 567 and FR 13022 ± 178 (mg/min*dL); ANOVA p< 0,0001 AL vs FR). Addi- tionally, these mice demonstrated elevated basal insulin secretion (p<0,01 ANOVA AL vs FR) and insulin resistance (AUC: AL 7147 ± 568 and FR 7274 ± 124 (mg/min*dL); ANOVA p<0,0001 AL vs FR). Gut microbiota transfer from FR mice to free-fed mice resulted in significantly increased glucose tolerance (AUC: Before microbiota transfer 25379 ± 485 and After microbiota transfer 21651 ± 394 (mg/ min*dL); ANOVA p< 0,0001 Before vs After microbiota transfer). Thus, microbiota of FR mice is responsible, at least in part, for the increased glucose tolerance.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that FR mice develop increased glucose tolerance as an adaptation to negative energy balance, with gut microbiota playing a crucial role in glucose regulation. Ongoing work aims to identify the specific bacteria and metabolites responsible for these effects and provide insight into the mechanisms of glucose homeostasis.

**Background and aims:**
While β cell dysfunction represents a key pathogenetic factor in T2D onset, collecting appropriate pancreatic samples from metabolically profiled donors to gain insight into islet pathobiology has proven challenging. In this scenario, although iso- lated human islets are widely used to investigate β cell function, cur- rent literature lacks direct studies correlating ex vivo islet responsive- ness with in vivo insulin secretion profiles. In this study, we aim to investigate possible mirroring between in vivo insulin secretion and ex vivo islet function of subjects with and without T2D undergoing pancreatectomy.

**Materials and methods:**
36 subjects in list for pancreatectomy for non-malignant intra- and extrapancreatic neoplasms underwent OGTT and hyperglycemic clamp (HC) and were divided in: non- diabetic (ND n=23) and diabetics (DM n=13). Parameters of β cell function were calculated by C-peptide deconvolution. Islets were iso- lated from tissues collected during surgery by collagenase P diges- tion, followed by Lympholyte separation. Islets were stimulated with 3.3 and 16.7 mM glucose (G) and 20 mM arginine (Arg). Insulin levels were assessed by ELISA. SI16.7 was calculated as the ratio of insulin levels measured at 16.7 and 3.3 mM G stimulation; SIArg was calculated as the ratio of insulin measured at 20 mM Arg and 3.3 G stimulation.

**Results:**
DM displayed reduced SI16.7 compared to ND (p=0.02). In ND, SIArg was negatively correlated to basal glucose (r=0.45, p=0.03). In DM, SI16.7 was associated with C-peptide AUC dur- ing OGTT (r=0.45 p=0.02) and with the following parameters: total and basal insulin secretion rate (tISR, r=0.66 p=0.01; bISR r=0,67 p<0.01), Glucose Sensitivity (r=0.59, p=0.02) and with standardized insulin secretion at 8 mmol/L glucose (r=0.55, p=0.04). Addition- ally, in DM but not in ND, SI16.7 was positively correlated with HC-derived second phase insulin secretion (ISR2nd r=0.82 p<0.01).

**Conclusion:**
In ND, ex vivo stimulation reflects poorly in vivo func- tion, illuminating the role of other players beyond β cells in normal glucose homeostasis. Conversely, in DM, the surprisingly preserved ability to respond to high glucose is closely correlated with functional parameters in vivo, suggesting an heightened β cell autonomous role in metabolic control under T2D conditions, and the extreme hetero- geneity in ex vivo functional responses.

**Background and aims:**
Fasting hyperinsulinemia is a key feature of obesity and contributes to diabetes progression. However, it is still unclear: (i) which index of obesity is most important; (ii) what is the shape of the dose-response curve between obesity and insu- lin secretion; (iii) what physiological mechanisms sustain insulin hypersecretion; (iv) what are the underlying causes; and (v) whether sex-related differences exist.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from 1,250 healthy EGIR-RISC participants (547 men, 703 women) aged 30-60 years (BMI 18.5-40.0 kg/m²) over 3.5 years. Assessments included body composition, insulin secretion, β-cell function modeling from OGTT, clamp-derived insulin sensitivity, and endogenous glucose produc- tion (EGP) in 368 participants. Multivariable regression and strati- fications by BMI, body fat %, waist-to-hip ratio, and fat mass evalu- ated obesity’s effect on insulin secretion and β-cell function.

**Results:**
The impact of obesity on fasting insulin secretion (FIS) was near-linear across the full spectrum of BMI and WHR values. Among adiposity indices, fat mass (Stβ = 0.27, p < 0.0001) and waist circumference (Stβ = 0.21, p < 0.0001) were the strongest predictors of FIS. Insulin secretion increased 2.4-fold across BMI deciles, and adiposity-associated insulin hypersecretion appeared to be driven by the combination of hyperglycemia and an increase in a specific β-cell function (ISR@5). At follow-up, weight gain (∆weight = +5.1 ± 3.8 kg) was associated with an increase in FIS and fasting glucose (+0.20 ± 0.63 mM, p < 0.03), whereas weight loss (∆weight = -4.7 ± 2.8 kg) led to a reduction in FIS and fasting glucose (+0.06 ± 0.55 mM, p < 0.006). ISR@5 declined in both weight losers and those with stable weight (-0.17 ± 1.9 and -0.16 ± 1.0 U/h, respectively; p < 0.002 for both), but not in gainers (-0.06 ± 1.1 U/h). Peripheral insulin resistance, plasma NEFA, and leptin only partially accounted for obesity’s effect on insulin secretion. Subset analysis of fasting and clamp EGP data suggested a rightward shift in the dose-response curve across fat mass quintiles, indicat- ing progressive hepatic glucose overproduction despite preserved hepatic insulin response.

**Conclusion:**
The effect of body mass on insulin secretion is nearly linear, more pronounced in men, and primarily driven by fat mass. Hypersecretion is sustained by elevated plasma glucose and ISR@5 and is only partially explained by typical hormonal and metabolic consequences of obesity. Our findings suggest that hepatic glucose overproduction contributes to the fasting hyperinsulinemia observed in individuals with obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Presymptomatic type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the progressive decline of β-cell function and is typi- cally divided in well-defined stages, each manifesting peculiar pheno- typic features. Specifically, in stage 2 T1D (S2), individuals with two or more islet antibodies may manifest mild dysglycaemia, whereas the transition to severe dysglycaemia and insurgence of symptoms define the onset of stage 3 (S3, clinical diagnosis). In this study, we aim to develop a progression model of β-cell function, potentially usable to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions to delay T1D onset.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from the placebo arms of two clinical trials were used. The S2 dataset consists of 23 individuals (baseline, median ­[25 , ­75 percentiles]: age=14 [12, 16] years, BMI=22 [19, 25] kg/m , HbA1c=5.2 [4.9, 5.3] %) who were longitudinally studied with oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) every 3.5 [2.1, 4.3] months until S3 was diagnosed. The S3 dataset consists of 87 individuals (age=16 [12, 24] years, BMI=20 [18, 22] kg/m , HbA1c=9.7 [8.1, 12.3] %) who underwent mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTT) every 6.2 [6.1, 6.3] months for 24 [19, 25] months; all the S3 patients underwent insulin therapy for the duration of the study. In each visit, plasma glu- cose and C-peptide were frequently measured and the Oral C-peptide Minimal Model was used to quantify dynamic (Φ ) and static (Φ ) responsivity indices. These were then used to develop a mathematical model describing the decline of β-cell responsivity from S2 to S3. The model assumes that, T months before the clinical diagnosis, both Φ and Φ start declining exponentially (with time constant τ ), and the decline accelerates in S3 (shorter time constant, τ ). The decline is also assumed to vary based on individual HbA1c, to reflect the impact of glucotoxicity (GT).

**Results:**
The model was effective in predicting the dynamic (Φ ) and static (Φ ) β-cell responsivity in individuals progressing from S2 to S3 T1D (Fig. 1). The inclusion of GT allowed to well predict the worsen- ing of β-cell responsivity right before diagnosis, due to the mild rise of HbA1c, and its partial recovery in the “honeymoon phase”, due to the initial decrease in HbA1c achieved via insulin administration after diagnosis. Parameters Φ and Φ declined with a time constant τ =30.1 [26.7, 33.4] months in S2. After the onset, the decline of both responsivities was faster: τ =18.1 [12.4, 36.6] months and τ =12.5 [8.6, 25.3] months, respectively. The S2 decline lasted for T=19.8 [17.3, 23.4] months before clinical diagnosis. The model also predicted a decrease of 42.4 [38.6, 47.1] % in β-cell responsivity for a two-fold increase in HbA1c.

**Conclusion:**
The proposed model well described the transition from S2 to S3 T1D in our data and it is potentially usable to optimize treatments to delay the onset of clinical T1D.

**Neuro-immune dialogue in pancreatic islets**

C. Leveau

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic islets are micro-organs scattered across the pancreas. They are responsible for producing insulin and glucagon, the main hormones regulating glycemia. It has been estab- lished that sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons control the pro- duction and secretion of these hormones in pancreatic islets. These neu- rons are associated with a dense network of Schwann cells (SC). Islet SC form a barrier at the periphery of islets, separating the endocrine from the exocrine compartments. It has been hypothesized that the SC mantle is important in the maintenance of islet integrity. However, their contribution to islet homeostasis and hormone secretion remains unexplored. Besides their role in supporting neurons, increasing evi- dence support SC as an independent actor in the regulation of tissue function, notably through immunomodulation. A crosstalk between SC and macrophages has been reported in the peripheral nervous system, notably in inflammatory contexts such as Wallerian degeneration. This crosstalk aims at reinstating tissue homeostasis after injury. Dialogue between glia cells and macrophages have been reported in the spleen, lymph nodes and the gut. As for most tissues, pancreatic islets are pop- ulated by resident macrophages. However, islet resident macrophages are unique as they display a pro-inflammatory profile at steady state. They can regulate the production of insulin the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b. In this project, I hypothesize that the dialogue between SC and macrophages is necessary for the maintenance of islet integrity and for adequate hormone secretion.

**Materials and methods:**
To address my objectives, I used high reso- lution 3D imaging and transcriptomic profiling of murine islets, scR- NAseq and interactome analysis and functional studies with murine islet cultures.

**Results:**
I was able to better characterize the identity and morphology of the islet SC network (See figure 1). Importantly, I show that islet macrophages physically interact with SC. To identify putative candi- dates mediating SC-macrophages crosstalk, I performed scRNAseq and interactome analysis. I identified Tgfb2 as putative ligand exclusively produced by SC, that may regulate islet inflammation. Finally, with functional studies, I show that TGFb2, but not TGFb1, promotes Il1b secretion in pancreatic islets.

**Conclusion:**
Altogether, my data address for the first time the dialogue between macrophages and SC in pancreatic islets. This work allows to better understand the unique role of SC in the homeostasis and inflam- matory status of pancreatic islets.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disease characterized by dysregulated glucose metabolism, impaired insulin secretion, and chronic inflammation. While pancreatic beta cells are the primary regulators of insulin release, emerging evidence highlights the role of immune cells within the islet microenvironment in shap- ing beta-cell function and metabolic homeostasis. Myeloid-derived immune cells actively engage in cross-talk with beta cells, influencing insulin secretion through inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress, and paracrine signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms governing this immune-beta cell interaction remain incompletely understood. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) serve as critical molecular sen- sors that regulate diverse physiological processes, including immune activation and metabolic control. GPCRs signal through distinct intra- cellular pathways, Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12/13 with each modulating spe- cific cellular functions. Among these, Gq signaling has been increas- ingly recognized for its role in immune cell activation and metabolic regulation, yet its impact on beta-cell function and glucose homeostasis remains largely unexplored.

**Materials and methods:**
To explore how immune cells regulate insu- lin secretion, we studied transgenic mice models which had myeloid immune cell with overexpression or disruption of Gq signaling path- way. Blood sugar levels were measured under different conditions to assess glucose metabolism. Insulin secretion was analyzed using ELISA, while gene expression studies helped identify changes in key regulatory factors. Immunohistochemistry was performed on pancreatic tissue to examine insulin-producing cells. Additionally, pharmacologi- cal agents were used to stimulate or inhibit specific pathways, allowing us to study the interaction between immune cells and pancreatic beta cells.

**Results:**
Our findings reveal that Gq signaling in immune cells regu- lates insulin secretion. However, insulin sensitivity and hepatic glucose production remained unchanged. This suggests that Gq signaling pri- marily influences beta-cell function via immune-mediated mechanisms rather than systemic metabolic shifts.

**Conclusion:**
These results provide novel insights into the immune-met- abolic axis governing pancreatic islet function. Targeting Gq signaling within the immune compartment may represent a promising therapeutic approach to regulate insulin secretion, preserve beta-cell function, and mitigate metabolic dysfunction in diabetes.

**Pancreatic islet calcium oscillation rhythm shifts synchronosusly to maintain blood glucose stability**

Y. Deng

**Background and aims:**
Pancreatic islets are established as regulators of blood glucose set points, but how the islet population collectively maintains blood glucose stability remains unknown. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multi-islet calcium fluorescence imaging, we investigated the intracellular calcium activity within pan- creatic islet population in response to glucose challenge and during periods of euglycemia.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed multi-islet calcium fluorescence imaging in Ins-cre ; ­GCaMP6f mice (C57BL/6 back- ground), enabling simultaneous observation of 50-100 islets for >5h. After a 16 h overnight fast, we acquire ~2h of baseline imaging before administering an intravenous glucose bolus (0.6g ­kg ) to test the glu- cose tolerance (IVGTT). Two hours post-IVGTT, we infused glucose at escalating rates (30 40 50 mg/kg/min, 20 min each). Blood glucose was monitored via tail vein measurements. Real-time pancreatic islets beta-cells Intracellular calcium concentration measured as GCaMP6 fluorescence intensity in each ROI. Intra- and inter-day blood glucose fluctuations in mice were monitored by a continuous glucose monitor immobilized on the back of the mice.

**Results:**
1. Transition to Euglycemia Induces Synchronous Ca² Oscillation Shifts Hyperglycemia-to-euglycemia transitions trig- gered a synchronous shift from slow (60-600 s period) to fast (0-60 s period) islet Ca² oscillations . Blood glucose levels during fast oscillations were significantly lower than during slow oscilla- tions ( = 161 islets from 6 mice; < 0.0001). 2. Collective Islet Response to Glucose Challenge Glucose challenges induced coordi- nated slow oscillations or sustained Ca² activation across multiple islets, followed by a return to fast oscillations. 3. Correlation with Mean Daily Glucose Mean blood glucose values during fast oscil- lations strongly correlated with mean daily glucose levels ( = 6 mice; ² = 0.9195, = 0.0025).

**Conclusion:**
Our study reveals the physiological significance of fast and slow Ca² oscillation patterns in pancreatic β-cells , dem- onstrating a direct association between fast oscillations and euglyce- mia. Importantly, we show that the fast-slow transition is a collective behavior of the islet population. evidence suggests glucagon and somatostatin regulate this oscillation shift, implicating paracrine signaling as a key modulator. Further mechanistic studies of these oscillatory transitions will elucidate how intra-islet crosstalk fine-tunes systemic glucose homeostasis.

**Beta cells as glucose forecasters: the functional relationship between insulin secretion rate, insulin and glucose in normogly- caemic, prediabetic and GLP1-RA treated patients**

1. Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel, Garvan Institute,

**Background and aims:**
Insulin secretion is regulated by metabolites such as glucose, and by a large number of endocrine, immune, neural, and other signaling pathways that induce, repress, and amplify insulin secretion. Despite an increasing understanding of these pathways, it is still difficult to understand insulin secretion as a whole in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients.

**Materials and methods:**
We enrolled 33 healthy volunteers and 41 obese prediabetic patients (BMI 34.9kg/m , HbA1c = 6.0%), includ- ing 13 patients who completed six months of semaglutide treatment. Participants were fasted overnight and received a 50g oral glucose bolus. Glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and GLP1 levels were measured at five-minute intervals during the first hour and at increasing intervals for up to three hours.

**Results:**
Insulin and Glucose levels were tightly correlated in healthy volunteers (r=0.99). ISR correlated most strongly (r=0.99) with glu- cose levels 7±3 minutes into the future. The GLP-1 profile preceded glucose and ISR profiles by 10±3 and 3±2 minutes, respectively. Pre- diabetic patients had higher fasting blood glucose, hyperinsulinemia, and marked impaired glucose clearance. Accordingly, ISR and GLP1 preceded glucose by 12±5 and 15±5 minutes, respectively. Fasting blood glucose and glucose clearance were improved in semaglutide- treated patients. However, ISR and glucose were highly correlated, and the ISR profile did not precede the glucose profile; the insulin profile lagged behind glucose by 9±3 minutes.

**Conclusion:**
Insulin levels in vivo reflect the convolution of ISR with insulin clearance. Our data show that in healthy individuals, beta cells effectively anticipate future glucose levels, likely through GLP1-medi- ated amplification of ISR, thus maintaining a high correlation between glucose and insulin. In prediabetic patients, GLP1 levels decline much earlier than glucose, leading to a premature decline in ISR and increas- ing the temporal gap between ISR and glucose, potentially contributing to the impaired glucose uptake in these patients. Semaglutide treat- ment, which provides constitutively high GLP1R signaling, eliminates the ability of the beta-cells to forecast glucose levels, thus introducing a delay between insulin and glucose levels. In conclusion, our data show that insulin secretion rate is best correlated with glucose levels 7 minutes into the future, which generates a near-perfect correlation between glucose and insulin.

**Background and aims:**
Subgroups of diabetes based on clustering of age at diagnosis, BMI, HbA1c, GAD-autoantibodies, HOMA2-B and HOMA2-IR have been suggested. We aimed to estimate their dif- ferences in pancreatic (PS) and hepatic steatosis (HS) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Also, we studied association of PS and pan- creas width (PW) to insulin secretion.

**Materials and methods:**
We included 170 patients at registration <2 years from diagnosis, and duration 3-10 years, from the Direva dia- betes registry (N>8000, Finland) [N=22, 11 and 32 for SAID, SIDD and SIRD (Severe Autoimmune/Insulin-Deficient/Insulin-Resistant Diabetes); N=47 and 59 for MOD and MARD (Obesity-/Age-Related Diabetes)]. The median diabetes duration was 5.9 years. We performed 1) MRI (1.5T) to estimate steatosis of pancreas and liver (qualitatively, PS, LS; and through dual-echo fat fractions, PFF, LFF), and 2) an i.v. glucagon (0.5mg at time 0 min) with measurement of C-peptide at 0 (C-Pe) and 6 min (ΔC-Pe) to estimate insulin secretion. For continuous variables, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman´s correla- tion were used.

**Results:**
The pancreatic width was narrowest in SAID (median [95% CI]; 13.8 [11.0-16.7] mm) with significant difference against SIDD (19.3 [16.0-21.7] mm; p<0.001), SIRD (17.0 [16.0-20.0] mm; p<0.001) and MOD (16.3 [15.3-18.7] mm; p<0.01) and narrower in MARD (16.3 [14.7-17.0] mm) than SIDD (p<0.05) and SIRD (p<0.05). While the median LFF was higher in MOD vs SAID, SIDD and MARD; p<0.05), and in SIRD vs SAID and MARD (p<0.05), there were no statistical differences in PFF between the subgroups (p=0.13). Insulin secretion (C-Pe, ΔC-Pe, HOMA2-B) correlated with PFF only in SAID (R=0.49, p<0.01; R=0.64, p=0.01; R=0.45, p<0.05, respectively). C-Pe (but not ΔC-Pe) correlated weakly to PFF (R=0.19, p<0.05) and PW (R=0.33, p<0.001). PFF correlated weakly with BMI (R=0.34, p<0.001) and HOMA2-IR (R=0.20, p<0.01). PW correlated weakly negatively with age (R=0.20, p<0.01). In total, 49% (83/170) had PS. Unlike PS patients, in patients without PS, PW correlated moderately with C-Pe (R=0.44, p<0.001) and weakly with HOMA2-B (R=0.28, p=0.008). PW, C-Pe, HOMA2-IR, LFF and BMI were higher in PS vs non-PS patients (17.6 [16.8-18.4] vs. 15.8 [15.1-16.5] mm; p=0.001, 1.26 [1.15-1.37] vs. 1.03 [0.92-1.14] mmol/l; p<0.01, 3.0 [2.8-3.3] vs 2.4 [2.2-2.7]; p<0.01; 10.4 [6.8-15.1] vs 5.9 [2.8-9.5] %; p<0.05; 32.9 [31.8-34.0] vs. 28.9 [27.8-30.0] kg/m2, p<0.001, respec- tively). Patients with PS without HS (n=29) had similar BMI than those having HS without PS (n=42), but were older (71.9 [65.9-74.4] vs 63.5 [59.6-67.8] years; p<0.01), had lower C-Pe (0.97 [0.71-1.16] vs 1.20 [1.09-1.43] nmol/l; p<0.01), HOMA2-B (91.4 [71.3-105.1] vs 121.7 [95.4-133.9]; p<0.05) and HOMA2-IR (2.3 [1.9-2.8] vs 2.9 [2.6-3.5]; p<0.01). Prevalence of PS was higher in men vs women (65% vs 34%; BMI-adjusted odds ratio, 4.45 [2.19-9.04]; p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
While the subgroups did not differ regarding pancreatic steatosis, SIRD and MOD had more hepatic steatosis. Our findings indicate that in diabetes patients, hepatic steatosis associates more to insulin resistance and poorer metabolic health despite lower age than pancreatic steatosis.

**Background and aims:**
Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at increased risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, long-term data on objectively measured physical fitness in this population remain limited. This study aimed to investigate aerobic fitness and muscle strength in relation to glucose tolerance and metabolic health 10 years post-GDM, and to identify protein biomarkers associated with fitness.

**Materials and methods:**
Forty-five women (age 44 ± 5 years; BMI 26.4 ± 4.7 kg/m²) were assessed 10 years after GDM. Assessments included a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, fasting blood samples, body composition analysis, and physical fitness tests—peak oxygen uptake (VO peak), peak fat oxidation, and maximal isometric muscle strength. Proteomic analysis was performed on fasting serum samples.

**Results:**
Among participants, 62% had normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 27% had IGT, and 11% had T2D. The T2D group exhibited the highest waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), visceral fat mass, and HOMA-IR, and the lowest HDL cholesterol levels. VO peak and muscle strength were significantly lower in the T2D group, even after adjustment for age and BMI ­(VO : 25.2 vs 31.8 (IGT) and 30.7 (NGT) ml/kg/min, leg extension: 124 vs 237 (IGT) and 240 (NGT) Nm, p<0.05). Linear regression analyses (adjusted for age and BMI) showed that higher VO peak and muscle strength were associated with lower HbA1c, lower WHR, higher HDL levels, and greater lean body mass. Peak fat oxida- tion was positively associated with lean mass and HDL. Proteomic profiling identified 35 proteins significantly correlated with at least one fitness parameter, of which 24 were also associated with glucose metabolism.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the long-term importance of physi- cal fitness, particularly muscle strength and lean mass, for metabolic health in women with a history of GDM. The identification of fitness- associated proteins offers new insights into potential pathways linking exercise capacity to glucose regulation. These proteins may serve as biomarkers of fitness or targets for future research on exercise-induced adaptations. Overall, the findings support promoting physical fitness as part of long-term strategies to reduce metabolic risk after GDM.

**Machine learning-based differentiation of diabetic and degenera- tive low back pain using clinical and radiographic biomarkers**

Y. Teng

**Background and aims:**
Low back pain (LBP) presents a diagnostic challenge in distinguishing between diabetes-associated mixed pain (neuro-inflammatory) and degenerative bone-related etiologies. Current clinical assessments lack specificity, leading to delayed or suboptimal management. This study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model integrating clinical, biochemical, and radiographic biomarkers to differentiate these subtypes, thereby guiding targeted therapeutic strategies.

**Materials and methods:**
We retrospectively analyzed data from 412 LBP patients (208 diabetic, 204 non-diabetic degenerative controls). Variables included routine blood tests (e.g., glucose, hs-CRP), blood biochemistry (albumin, HDL-C, LDL-C), CT-derived L4-L5 paraspinal fat area, and demographic factors (age, sex, BMI). The mlr3 framework was employed for automated feature selection, hyperparameter tun- ing, and model evaluation. To ensure robustness, a stratified 10-fold cross-validation was applied during model training and hyperparameter optimization, with 80% of the data allocated for training/validation and 20% held out as an independent test set. Six algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) were evaluated. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis identified key predictors.

**Results:**
The XGBoost model achieved superior performance (AUC: 0.904, sensitivity: 89.2%, specificity: 91.5%) compared to other algo- rithms. SHAP analysis revealed six dominant features: 1) Albumin (ALB, negative correlation with diabetic LBP), 2) Fasting Glucose (Glu, positive correlation), 3) hs-CRP (elevated in diabetic cohort), 4) Age (older patients favored degenerative etiology), 5-6) HDL-C (lower) and LDL-C (higher) in diabetic cases. The CT-measured paraspinal fat area showed moderate discriminative power.

**Conclusion:**
This study presents the first ML model to distinguish diabetic mixed LBP from degenerative LBP with high accuracy. The integration of inflammatory (hs-CRP), metabolic (Glu, HDL/LDL), and structural biomarkers (CT fat area) provides a multidimensional diagnostic tool. Clinically, rapid identification of diabetic neuro-inflam- matory components could prioritize anti-glycemic and anti-inflamma- tory therapies over purely mechanical interventions. Future work will validate these findings prospectively and explore causal relationships between metabolic dysregulation and spinal degeneration.

**Background and aims:**
People with type 1 diabetes experience both hypo- and hyperglycemia during exercise, posing significant chal- lenges. While hyperglycemia is often reported during competitive events, this phenomenon remains unresolved and warrants further investigation. This study aimed to examine blood glucose fluctuations and hormonal responses in individuals with and without type 1 diabetes during a 5K test runs versus 5K races.

**Materials and methods:**
Twenty-four runners (12 with type 1 diabetes, 12 without) completed a 5K test run and a 5K race in randomized order. The race was an official event, while the test run took place on a meas- ured 5K route. Meals, insulin, and time of day were standardized, with no intake of food, beverages (except 300 ml water), or insulin dosing allowed two hours pre-run and one hour post-run. Plasma metabolites and hormone levels were measured at baseline (-30 min) before the run and at 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes post-run. Heart rate was recorded on both test and race days.

**Results:**
Race time and heart rate were similar on both days within each group. Plasma glucose increased significantly after both the test run and race in both groups. Healthy runners exhibited higher iAUC glucose levels on race day compared to test day (p=0.04), whereas this difference was not significant in runners with type 1 diabetes (p=0.11). The change in glucose from baseline to 10 min post-run (ΔGlucose) was greater on race day than on test day in healthy runners (4.5 [3.42, 5.58] vs. 3.5 [2.73, 4.27] mmol/L, p=0.005), whereas in type 1 diabetes runners, the increase was only borderline significant (2.1 [0.38, 3.82] vs. 1.1 [-0.35, 2.55] mmol/L, p=0.07). Plasma adrenaline levels were significantly higher on race day compared to the test run in both groups (p=0.04 in healthy runners, p=0.001 in type 1 diabetes runners), with a trend towards higher race-day plasma noradrenaline (p=0.07). Baseline cortisol was 25% higher pre-run on race day compared to the test run in type 1 diabetes runners (p=0.02). Group and condition differences were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, and glucose iAUC differences were assessed via paired t-tests.

**Conclusion:**
Plasma glucose increased significantly in response to both high-intensity test runs and races, with higher post-run levels on race days. This enhanced glycemic response is likely mediated by elevated adrenaline levels. These findings suggest that competition-related stress responses may contribute to exercise-induced hyperglycemia in athletes with type 1 diabetes, highlighting the need for tailored glucose manage- ment strategies during competitive events.

**Background and aims:**
Managing blood glucose during exercise is challenging for individuals with type 1 diabetes. This study aimed to investigate whether pre-exercise lactose and galactose consumption could prevent glucose excursions and protect from hypoglycemia dur- ing exercise.

**Materials and methods:**
In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, fourteen physically active adults with type 1 diabetes partici- pated. Participants consumed a drink containing 20 g of glucose, lac- tose, galactose, or placebo (non-caloric sweetener) 30 minutes before completing a 60-minute cycling at 50% Wmax after an overnight fast.

**Results:**
Lactose or galactose consumption reduced glycemic fluctua- tions compared to glucose. Glucose supplementation led to the steep- est ascent and descent in plasma glucose, while galactose caused the smoothest changes [glucose vs. lactose, glucose vs. galactose, lactose vs. galactose, all p<0.01]. Plasma glucose levels rose significantly above placebo post-supplementation: Δ glucose: 4.9 mmol/L (95% CI: 4.2-5.6), Δ lactose: 3.7 mmol/L (95% CI: 2.9-4.4), and Δ galactose: 2.3 mmol/L (95% CI: 1.6-3.0), all p<0.01. Time in euglycemia during exercise was highest after placebo consumption: 86% (95% CI 77-91), followed by galactose 71% (95% CI: 63-79), and lactose 70 (95% CI 62-77), and glucose 48% (95% CI: 40-57). Glucose supplementation caused most time spent in hyperglycemia 52% (95% CI 43-60). Time spent below range was significant higher after placebo, compared to the carbohydrate interventions, all p<0.05. Hypoglycemia was observed in five participants following placebo consumption, two after lactose, and one after galactose. Plasma galactose level increased to a maximum of 0.45±0.26 mmol/L 30 min after galactose consumption, whereas an increase of only 0.08±0.07 mmol/L was observed 45 min after lactose consumption. Galactose levels remained below limit of detection after glucose and the non-caloric sweetener. Respiratory exchange ratio, free fatty acids, glycerol, lactate levels were similar after all supplements.

**Conclusion:**
Pre-exercise lactose and galactose consumption reduced glucose excursions compared to glucose and lowered hypoglycemia risk compared to placebo, suggesting their potential as effective pre- exercise nutrition strategies for individuals with type 1 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
While studies have examined the effects of a physically active lifestyle on HbA1c levels, research on the associa- tion between energy expenditure and CGM-derived glycaemia remains limited in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We investigated the long-term effects of physical activity and exercise, measured as energy expenditure in kcal/week, on CGM metrics in a generally physically active cohort with T1D over a period of six months.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 179 adults with T1D (physical activity and 13,476 exercise sessions recorded; 56 females; median [IQR] age: 42 years [35-53]) were included in this analysis. 36% were using MDI or CSII therapy (unspecified), 15% were using MDI, and 49% were using CSII/AID. To assess CGM metrics based on the level of regular physical activity and exercise, the cohort was divided into four groups using the median and quartiles for energy expenditure (kcal/week): Q1) <2206 kcal/week, Q2) 2206-3056 kcal/week, Q3) 3057-4165 kcal/week, and Q4) >4165 kcal/week. Energy expenditure was tracked via participants’ mobile phones and defined as the esti- mated energy used above the resting metabolic rate. The four physical activity groups were compared for CGM metrics using either a one- way ANOVA or a Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or Dunn’s post hoc test. Across the entire cohort, the relationship between kcal/week and CGM metrics was analysed using Spearman’s rank correlation (p<0.05).

**Results:**
Over the 6-month observational period, median [IQR] CGM- derived metrics were as follows: TBR <54 mg/dL: 0.2% [0.0; 0.6], TBR <70 mg/dL: 1.5% [0.6; 3.1], TITR 70-140 mg/dL: 53.9% [39.2; 64.6], TIR 70-180 mg/dL: 77.9% [66.7; 87.2], TAR >180 mg/dL: 15.9% [8.4; 23.3], TAR >250 mg/dL: 2.4% [0.4; 6.4], mean glucose: 141 mg/dL [128; 159], standard deviation of glucose: 45 mg/dL [36; 55], and coef- ficient of glucose variation (CV): 31% [28; 36]. The overall median [IQR] energy expenditure was 3056 kcal/week [2205; 4165]. Defining four groups based on regular energy expenditure yielded the follow- ing median [IQR] values: Q1: 1589 kcal/week [887; 2011], Q2: 2592 kcal/week [2400; 2846], Q3: 3432 kcal/week [3166; 3700] and Q4: 5044 kcal/week [4561; 5498]. When comparing CGM-derived metrics across the four physical activity groups, significant differences were found only for TBR <54 mg/dL (p=0.03). Post hoc analyses revealed that TBR <54 mg/dL differed significantly between Q1 and Q4 (0.12% [0.00; 0.37] vs. 0.43% [0.11; 0.78], p=0.03). No significant differences were observed for the remaining CGM-derived metrics (p>0.05). Cor- relation analyses between overall kcal/week and CGM-derived metrics showed significant relationships for TBR <54 mg/dL (r=0.23, 95% CI: 0.08-0.37; p=0.002), TBR <70 mg/dL (r=0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.34; p=0.008), and CV (r=0.19, 95% CI: 0.04-0.33; p=0.009).

**Conclusion:**
Within this physically active and well-controlled cohort with T1D, a physically active lifestyle was associated with an increased risk of clinically relevant hypoglycemia. Taking this into account, ther- apy recommendations for physically active individuals with T1D may need to be tailored according to their overall physical activity levels.

**Background and aims:**
The new position paper of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)/International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) summarizes existing evidence on commercially available automated insulin delivery (AID) systems in the context of physical activity and exercise, and provides practice-oriented recommendations for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using an AID system; however, only a limited number of studies on the use of AID systems during strength training in people with T1D are available. Therefore, the aim of this preliminary analysis was to investigate the efficacy of the mylife CamAPS FX system in compari- son to the manual mode of the insulin pump during strength training in adults with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Ten adults with T1D using the mylife CamAPS FX AID system (6 females; age 32.5±12.5 years; BMI 26.5±2.85 kg/m2; HbA1c 6.5±0.6%) performed a one-hour (h) strength training (hypertrophy training, ~70% of maximum force, 4 sets, 8─12 repetitions, recovery 105 seconds; bench press, shoulder press, squats, latissimus pull-downs, sit-ups and biceps hammer curls). When using the auto mode, glucose target was set at 120 mg/dL, and ‘Ease-off’ function was started two h prior to the start of the exercise. In manual mode, basal rate was reduced by 50% two h before the strength training. Both exercise sessions were performed under fasting conditions for at least three h prior to the start of exercise. Glycaemia was assessed for start vs. end blood glucose by means of paired t-test. Additionally, the absolute change in glucose (Δ-glucose) was calculated for start vs. end blood glucose and compared between both trial arms (p<0.05).

**Results:**
During strength training, the mylife CamAPS FX system (start glucose 129±43 mg/dL vs. end glucose 140±40 mg/dL; p=0.24) as well as the manual mode with a 50% reduced basal rate (start glucose 135±44 mg/dL vs. end glucose 152±54 mg/dL; p=0.09) kept the blood glucose levels stable. The mean difference in glucose (Δ-glucose) for start vs. end of training was 11±29 mg/dL when in auto mode and 17±29 mg/dL when in manual mode (p=0.46).

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, this preliminary analysis showed, that the therapeutic strategy of increasing the sensor glucose target to 120 mg/ dL in combination with the ‘Ease-off’ function is effective to maintain euglycemia during strength training and might be more convenient than changing the basal rate in non-auto mode manually.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is known to be a condi- tion associated with increased chronic inflammation. Regular physical activity and exercise represent an integral part of a healthy lifestyle for people living with T1D. However, particularly data on the trajectories of inflammatory markers with repeated endurance training bouts are scarce. The aim of this exploratory analysis was to investigate the acute and mid-term effects of endurance exercise in T1D on the food intake modulating metabolite lactoylphenylalanine (Lac-Phe) as well as on a set of inflammatory markers.

**Materials and methods:**
Within the primary outcome of the ULTRA- FLEXI-1, two basal insulins, Glargine U-300 and Degludec U-100 were compared in individuals with T1D. Over eight weeks, a total of 24 training sessions were completed and venous blood samples were collected immediately before the session (B0), at minute 30 (M30), and shortly before the end (M60) of the 60-minute Wcycle ergom- eter exercise sessions to assess Lac-Phe and inflammatory markers. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects model with multiplicity adjustment.

**Results:**
A total of 25 individuals (11 women) with T1D participated in this study (mean age: 41.4 ± 11.9 years, weight: 74.4 ± 15.3 kg, BMI: 23.7 ± 3.1 kg/m², HbA1c: 59 ± 9 mmol/mol, diabetes duration: 16.8 ± 10.4 years). Over the exercise sessions, LacPhe levels increased significantly (p<0.001) with a changing pattern over the course of the trial. IL-6 and Ferritin levels increased significantly from B0 to M60 (p<0.001), however levels significantly decreased over time (p=0.028 for IL-6 and p<0.001 for ferritin). HsCRP increased from B0 to M60 (p<0.001), with no significant change over time (see figure).

**Conclusion:**
Within a single 60-minute exercise session significant increases in all investigated markers were observed. However, with an increasing number of repeated exercise sessions the levels declined and the pattern within the exercise sessions changed.

**Background and aims:**
The glycemic response to exercise in individu- als with type 1 diabetes varies based on the time of day. While previous studies suggest that morning exercise may help to prevent hypoglyce- mia, available data are limited and influenced by potential confounders. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the glucose-lowering effects of aerobic exercise performed in the morning versus the afternoon in individuals with type 1 diabetes. We hypothesized that morning exercise would protect against hypoglycemia and reduce the need for carbohydrate supplementation.

**Materials and methods:**
Twelve individuals with type 1 diabetes (9 males, 3 females; 10 on MDI, 2 on CSII) completed two 60-minute treadmill exercise sessions at 50% Wmax, one in the morning (9 AM, fasted) and one in the afternoon (4 PM, 5 hours postprandial). Stand- ardized meals were consumed in the 12-hour pre-exercise period and bolus insulin administration was not permitted <4.5 hours pre-exercise. Blood samples were collected from 120 min before to 120 min after exercise. Glucose infusion (20 %) was initiated if plasma glucose fell below 3.9 mmol/L.

**Results:**
Plasma glucose remained stable in the morning but tended to decline in the afternoon (Δ 0.03 [−1.16, 1.22] vs. -1.5 [−2.41, −0.59] mmol/L, p = 0.06; Welch two-sample t-test). Hypoglycemia occurred in one participant in the morning, whereas five experienced hypo- glycemia during and two post-exercise in the afternoon (p = 0.005; Cox proportional hazards model, Wald test). No glucose infusion was required before or during morning exercise, and only one participant needed post-exercise glucose (7.6 g). In contrast, total glucose infusion was significantly higher in the afternoon (160 g vs. 7.6 g, p = 0.02; Wilcoxon signed-rank test), with an average of 3 g pre-exercise, 5.9 g during, and 5 g post-exercise per participant. Data are presented as mean [95% CI] for parametric variables and as medians or counts with p-values for non-parametric comparisons.

**Conclusion:**
Morning exercise reduces the risk of hypoglycemia and lowers carbohydrate requirements compared to afternoon exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes. These findings support morning exercise as a strategy to reduce hypoglycemia risk and carbohydrate requirements in type 1 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Exercise can impact acute appetite and energy intake; however, it is uncertain whether the time of day it is performed alters these responses and whether they differ between individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aim of this study was to inves- tigate the acute effects of exercise and exercise timing on ad libitum energy intake and appetite regulation in individuals with overweight or obesity, with and without T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Fifty-eight individuals participated in a randomized, controlled, cross-over trial. Each participant completed four test visits, in which they performed 45 minutes of high-intensity exercise or rest in the morning (≈08:00) or late afternoon (≈15:30). The primary outcome was ad libitum energy intake, assessed from a meal served 15 minutes after exercise or rest. Secondary outcomes included composite appetite scores (4x100-point visual analogue scales), appetite-related hormones and metabolites, and 24-hour self- reported energy intake. Analyses of these are ongoing, and results will be presented at the conference.

**Results:**
The participants had a median [IQR] age of 59 years [49- 69], BMI of 29.4 kg/m [28.2-31.4], and 29 of the 58 participants had T2D. Ad libitum energy intake was significantly lower after exer- cise compared to rest (−358 kJ [95% CI: −514 to −202], p<0.001; exercise: 3045 kJ [2671-3419], rest: 3403 kJ [3031-3775]). This was supported by lower composite appetite scores, i.e., lower hunger lev- els, both immediately after exercise (−10 points [95% CI: −14 to −6], p<0.001) and 15 minutes post-exercise (−7 points [−10 to −3], p<0.001) compared with rest. Interestingly, 15 minutes after the meal, composite appetite scores were higher following exercise compared with rest (5 points [2-8], p = 0.002), suggesting greater postprandial satiety in response to exercise. The lower energy intake after exercise did not differ significantly between morning and late afternoon sessions (p=0.149). Similarly, composite appetite scores did not show statis- tically significant differences based on the time of day exercise was performed. Both participants with and without T2D showed a lower energy intake after exercise (T2D: p<0.001; non-T2D: p=0.008). The effect of exercise on energy intake was not modified by group (inter- action p=0.481). Likewise, composite appetite scores did not differ between groups. There was an effect of time-of-day for individuals without T2D (p=0.023), but not for T2D (p=862), but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.079).

**Conclusion:**
In individuals with overweight or obesity, with and with- out T2D, acute high-intensity exercise significantly reduced ad libitum energy intake and subjective appetite compared to rest. Exercise timing did not significantly influence these outcomes.

**Inflammatory markers and blood glucose are higher after morning versus afternoon exercise in type 2 diabetes**

M.J. Keller

**Background and aims:**
To investigate effects of time-of-day on glucose control in individuals with type 2 diabetes undergoing high-intensity inter- val exercise. Additionally, the association between regular eating behavior and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) was examined.

**Materials and methods:**
A crossover trial was conducted with 12 men and 12 women with type 2 diabetes and 12 men and 12 women without diabetes. Participants performed high-intensity interval exercise ses- sions in the morning and afternoon, at least 7 days apart. Standardized meals were provided the day before, during, and after exercise. Con- tinuous glucose monitoring was used to assess blood glucose levels.

**Results:**
Morning exercise increased blood glucose during the 2-hour post-exercise period in men (P<0.05) and women (P<0.01) with type 2 diabetes. Conversely, glucose was unaltered following afternoon exer- cise. Glycemic variability (MAGE) was reduced during a three-day meal intervention in men (P<0.001) and women (P<0.05) with type 2 diabetes, but not in non-diabetic individuals. Participants exhibited higher elevated morning cortisol levels (P<0.001). Individuals with type 2 diabetes exhibited higher levels of the inflammation marker C-reactive protein (P<0.001) and the heart failure marker NT-proBNP (P<0.001) in morning versus afternoon.

**Conclusion:**
In type 2 diabetes, afternoon versus morning high-inten- sity interval exercise appears to be more effective for maintaining glu- cose control. Further research is needed to explore how elevated morn- ing cortisol levels and inflammatory markers influence the exercise response and impact on glucose regulation. Additionally, consistent meal timing and controlled caloric intake are recommended for reduc- ing mean amplitude of glycemic excursions.

**Background and aims:**
Prediabetes encompasses the aetiologically distinct conditions of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Lifestyle interventions can prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Emerging evidence suggests the effects of lifestyle interventions differ by prediabetes phenotype. Whether this is accompanied by differing behavioural responses to lifestyle interventions is unknown. We aimed to characterise physical activity change following intervention in those at high risk of T2D, stratified by prediabetes phenotypes.

**Materials and methods:**
Pooled data from three randomised controlled trials were used (n = 1,875) with up to 48 months of annual follow-up. Participants were identified as being at high risk of T2D and were ran- domised to either: 1) control group receiving a detailed advice leaflet; 2) intervention group receiving structured group-based behavioural interventions which promoted increased physical activity by targeting self-efficacy, self-monitoring and goal setting using pedometers, with tailored follow-up support. Change in physical activity was measured objectively at baseline and follow-up. Generalised estimating equations stratified by prediabetes sub-type were used to account for repeated measures (across available follow-up at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months) adjusted for treatment (intervention vs control), timepoint, study, sex, ethnicity, age, body mass index (BMI) and baseline values. Baseline demographics are median (interquartile range). Intervention effects for the difference in change in physical activity (steps/day) between treat- ment groups are mean (95% confidence interval).

**Results:**
Participants were aged 64 (58, 69) years, 61% male, 79% White European, with a BMI of 30 (27, 34) kg/m . Baseline steps/day were 5827 (4026, 7967). Over 48-months, steps/day increased in the intervention group (vs control) in those with normoglycaemia (n = 745; 247 [4, 491]), isolated IGT (n = 580; 523 [229, 818]), and IFG with IGT (n = 310; 808 [402, 1213]), but not those with isolated IFG (n = 240; 71[-429, 571]; fig 1). 2-hour post-challenge glucose levels were improved in the intervention group in participants with both IFG and IGT (-0.5 [-0.9, -0.0] mmol/l) only.

**Conclusion:**
Structured behavioural interventions promoted clinically significant increases in physical activity in those with IGT, but not IFG. Differences in the effectiveness of diabetes prevention programmes in different phenotypes may in part be mediated by behavioural factors. Further work is needed to understand why lifestyle intervention adher- ence may be lower in IFG.

**Exercise cessation rapidly causes hyperinsulinaemia and metabolic dysfunction**

**Background and aims:**
Cessation of regular exercise increases risk factors for type 2 diabetes such as insulin resistance, hyperinsuline- mia, and adiposity. Hyperinsulinemia is often considered to occur in response to insulin resistance; however, studies suggest that hyperinsu- linemia plays a causal role in the development of insulin resistance and obesity. Hyperinsulinemia following exercise cessation may therefore drive risk factors for diabetes. The main aim of this study was to assess the impact of exercise cessation on metabolic function in both sexes of C57BL/6J mice housed under thermoneutral conditions.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate metabolic responses following exercise cessation, male and female C57BL/6J mice (n=6-9) were fed a high fat/high sucrose diet from 12 weeks of age and housed under thermoneutral conditions (28°C). Mice had access to a running wheel for 4 weeks, prior to the wheel being locked for 7 days. Active and sedentary control groups were also included. Body composition was measured throughout the study using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Upon conclusion of the study, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed (dose: 2g/kg of lean mass) and blood was collected via the saphenous vein for measurement of fasting insulin. Fixed sections of pancreas were analysed for beta-cell proliferation by immunofluo- rescent staining of insulin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and DAPI.

**Results:**
Exercise cessation for 7 days caused a rapid increase in fat mass (males= 48.29±8.01%; females=50.09±7.28%). Fasting insulin was significantly lower in active mice compared to sedentary controls (males - 1.16±0.16 vs 2.04±0.31 ng/ml, p=0.03; females - 0.48±0.06 vs 0.92±0.09 ng/ml, p<0.01) and became similar to sedentary lev- els following 7 days of inactivity (males - 1.80±0.22 ng/ml; females 0.72±0.10 ng/ml). Exercise cessation in male mice led to a higher fasting glucose level of 12.23±0.50 mM in comparison to both seden- tary (10.26±0.66 mM, p=0.03) and active control (9.58±0.0.54 mM, p=<0.01) groups. Furthermore, the glucose tolerance of female mice following 7 days of inactivity (glucose tolerance test area under the curve: 2796±213.90 mM*min) was significantly worse than that of the active control group (1911±98.71 mM*min, p<0.01) and like that of the sedentary control group (3089±194.70 mM*min). Beta-cell proliferation in both male and female mice was significantly higher following 7 days of exercise cessation in comparison to active control mice (males - 1.54±0.11 vs 0.88±0.12 %, p=0.04; females - 2.23±0.41 vs 0.77±0.09 %, p<0.01), becoming similar to that seen in sedentary mice (males - 1.61±0.45%; females - 1.67±0.37 %).

**Conclusion:**
Exercise cessation can rapidly increase risk factors for diabetes such as hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance and increased adiposity, and drive beta-cell proliferation in both sexes of C57BL/6J mice under thermoneutral conditions. Current research is examining whether hyperinsulinemia plays a causal role in the onset of this metabolic dysfunction following exercise cessation, by study- ing mice with a reduced insulin gene dosage that are protected from hyperinsulinemia.

**Exploring the link between timing of physical activity, body com- position, and cardiometabolic health in people with metabolically complicated overweight/obesity**

G. Panagiotou, Chondronikola

**Background and aims:**
While physical activity benefits cardiometa- bolic health, the impact of its timing remains less understood.

**Materials and methods:**
In this cross-sectional study, 32 individuals (75% female, aged 49±11 years, mean body mass index 36 ±7 kg/ m²) with metabolically complicated overweight/obesity were assessed over two weeks. During this period, participants were instructed to consume five meals and snacks per day within a 14-h daily eating window (approximately 07:00-21:00 hrs). Habitual physical activity was measured via wrist-worn accelerometer, and 24-hour glycaemic control was assessed via blinded continuous glucose monitoring. Body composition was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (index of skeletal muscle insu- lin sensitivity) and insulin-induced suppression of plasma free fatty acids (index of adipose tissue insulin sensitivity) were assessed via a two-stage hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp procedure. Linear regression analyses examined associations between activity timing, body composition, and cardiometabolic health parameters, adjusting for sex, age, and total activity.

**Results:**
In the fully adjusted model, proportionally higher physical activity levels in the morning (06:00-11:59 hrs) was associated with greater lean body mass [β = 0.43 kg, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): (0.05, 0.8 kg), p=0.03]. Proportionally higher physical activity levels in the afternoon activity (12:00-17:59 hrs) was associated with lower logarithmically-transformed fasting plasma triglycerides [β = -0.02 mg/dl, 95% CI: (-0.05, -0.0 mg/dl), p= 0.03] and borderline linked to fasting plasma glucose [β = 1.0 mg/dl, 95% CI: (-2.1, 0.06 mg/dl), p= 0.06]. Proportionally higher physical activity in the evening (18:00- 23:59 hrs) showed a trend toward improved adipose tissue insulin sensitivity [β = 0.9%, 95% CI: (-0.2, 1.9%), p=0.11]. No association was found between activity timing and 24-hour glycaemic control or skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.

**Conclusion:**
These preliminary findings suggest that morning physi- cal activity may be more beneficial for preserving lean body mass. Afternoon activity is associated with potential improvements in fast- ing plasma triglyceride and glucose levels. A trend between evening activity and improvements in adipose tissue insulin sensitivity was observed. Larger studies examining not only the timing but also the type and intensity of physical activity are needed to expand upon our findings.

5. Denmark, Odense, Denmark, Department of Internal Medicine, Steno

**Background and aims:**
Evidence suggests that people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are less physically active than people without T2D. However, evidence is primarily based on self-report and small sample sizes. This study comprehensively investigated subjective, objective and genetic risk of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) in people with and without T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
This head-to-head comparison combined data from the Danish Center for Strategic Research in Type 2 Dia- betes (DD2), including people recently diagnosed with T2D, and the Lolland-Falster Health Study (LOFUS), a household-based population study. Both studies have gathered information about PA and SB via the Saltin-Grimby physical activity level scale (total n=23663), acceler- ometers (Axivity, AX3 [n=3542]) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for self-reported/monitored PA and SB (n=22022).

**Results:**
People with T2D were represented by more men (59 vs. 41%), slightly older age (median: 61.4 vs. 59.5 years), and higher BMI (median: 30.7 vs. 26.5 kg/m ) and sex-adjusted waist circumference (median: 106 vs. 94 cm) compared to people without T2D. People with T2D reported being more sedentary (18 vs. 11%, p<0.01) and less moderately/vigorously physically active (20 vs. 26%, p<0.01) compared to people without T2D. Accelerometer-assessed PA and SB showed that people with T2D were less active (p<0.01), spending 79%, 19% and 2% of their daily waking hours on sedentary, light and moderate/vigorous activities, respectively, compared to people without T2D (75%, 22% and 3%). People with T2D also took fewer steps (3700 vs. 4766 steps/day; p<0.01) than people without T2D. According to genetic risk of PA and SB, PRS for both self-reported/monitored PA and SB were lower for people with T2D (all p<0.01). Overall, people with T2D appeared to have a higher propensity for inactivity compared to people without T2D. All these associations persisted after adjusting for age and sex, but attenuated or even reversed when further adjusted for BMI, previous CVD, mental well-being, smoking, education level and occupational status. Hence, in fully adjusted models, people with T2D had lower odds of self-reported SB (OR 0.82 [95% 0.71, 0.94]), spent more time on both accelerometer-assessed SB (Beta-coefficient: 7.6 min/day [95% CI 2.1, 13.1]) and moderate/vigorous PA (2.3 min/ day [95% CI 0.9, 3.7]) and took more steps (283 steps/day [95% CI 51, 515]) compared to people without T2D. Significant differences in PRS for PA and SB were no longer observed between people with and without T2D (p≥0.16).

**Conclusion:**
People with T2D were more sedentary and less physically active compared to people without T2D. However, the differences in PA were highly influenced by factors related to T2D rather than T2D per se.

**Background and aims:**
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) induces physiological adaptations such as improved cardiovascular fitness and insulin sensitivity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these benefits, particularly the role of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their microRNA (miRNA) cargo, remain poorly understood. miRNAs are key regulators of gene expression and may serve as bio- markers for individual responses to exercise. This study aimed to inves- tigate the miRNA profile of circulating EVs (EV-miRNAs) following a HIIT program in sedentary individuals and explore their potential as biomarkers for exercise response.

**Materials and methods:**
Twenty-four sedentary volunteers (aged 25-60 years, 54% women, BMI 25.6 ± 4.5 kg/m ) completed a 12-week HIIT program (3 sessions/week) on a stationary bike. Clinical data and plasma samples were collected before and after the HIIT program, and cardiorespiratory capacity was assessed through ergospirometry. Plasma EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography and EV- miRNAs were profiled by small RNA-Seq and validated by quantitative PCR. Paired t test was used to compare clinical parameters and EV- miRNA levels before and after the HIIT program.

**Results:**
The HIIT program resulted in a slight improvement in ­VO peak (from 27.4 ± 6.3 to 30.08 ± 7.17 mL/kg/min) and a signifi- cant increase in exercise workload (2.01 ± 0.49 to 2.31 ± 0.6 W/kg, p = 0.009), alongside a significant reduction in the HOMA-IR index (2.20 ± 1.15 to 1.49 ± 0.60, p = 0.0214). EV-miRNA profiling identified 14 upregulated and 9 downregulated EV-miRNAs post-HIIT. Notably, EV-miR-451a and EV-miR-486-5p levels were the most upregulated. Their levels were increased after the HIIT in all responders in terms of workload, distinguishing exercise responders from non-responders. In contrast, EV-miR-122-5p levels, which were correlated to triglyceride levels and have been reported to be increased in prediabetic patients, were significantly reduced after the HIIT program and changes were negatively correlated with workload improvements.

**Conclusion:**
This study identifies specific miRNAs as potential bio- markers of response to HIIT in sedentary individuals. EV-miR-451a and EV-miR-486-5p may serve as indicators of exercise adaptation, while EV-miR-122-5p could represent an early marker of metabolic improvement. These findings provide novel insights into the molecu- lar mechanisms of exercise response and support the potential of miRNAs for guiding personalized fitness interventions.

**Identification of contraction-specific phosphorylation pattern of TBC1D1 in murine C2C12 myotubes**

**Background and aims:**
In the insulin-resistant state, insulin-stim- ulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is impaired, while con- traction-mediated glucose uptake remains functional. TBC1D1, a Rab-GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP), is crucial for glucose uptake in response to insulin and muscle contraction. Akt and AMPK, respectively, phosphorylate TBC1D1, promoting GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface. While several phosphorylation sites in TBC1D1 have been identified, only a small fraction of them have been linked to a specific cellular function. Our previous data using TBC1D1 knockout mice suggested that TBC1D1 is differently regulated in response to activation of AMPK via the AMP-mimetic AICAR (5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide) versus muscle contraction, presumably due to differential phosphorylation of yet unknown sites. The objective of this study is to identify new contraction-regulated phosphorylation sites on TBC1D1 and deter- mine their specific role in glucose uptake as well as their dependency on kinases other than AMPK.

**Materials and methods:**
C2C12 myotubes overexpressing FLAG- tagged were subjected to either contraction (electrical pulse stimulation; EPS) (11.5 V, 1 Hz, 2 ms pulses for 6 h) or AICAR treat- ment (2 mM, 30 min) while being serum-starved to mimic muscle contraction or AMPK activation (n = 5). FLAG-TBC1D1 was purified from C2C12 cell lysates using immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. Tryptic peptides were measured in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode on an Orbitrap Exploris 480, and raw mass spectrometry data were processed using ProteomeDiscoverer 3.1 software. Protein iden- tification was carried out using the Chimerys search engine (Infer- ysPrediction model inferys_2.13.0.0_fragmentation model) against the reviewed SwissProt Mus musculus database (release v2024-10-02).

**Results:**
In C2C12 myotubes, both AICAR (2.33±0.54 SD fold; p<0.005 vs control, n=5) and EPS (1.65±0.55 SD fold; p<0.05 vs control, n=5) increased AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation. Conversely, Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation was increased by AICAR stimulation (2.31±0.28 SD fold; p<0.05 vs control, n=3) but not after EPS treat- ment. Our proteomics analysis revealed 28 Ser/Thr-phosphorylation sites in TBC1D1, including 16 novel non-canonical sites, among them S112, S476, T716 and S1130. Further analyses suggest that several sites were differentially phosphorylated in response to AICAR versus EPS, including S501, S565, Thr716 and Thr739.

**Conclusion:**
This study found several novel phosphorylation sites in TBC1D1. The data indicates that, besides the well-studied AMPK, muscle contraction also activates additional kinases involved in regu- lating TBC1D1 and its downstream effectors in muscle cells. Further investigations will focus on contraction-activated kinases (e.g. AMPK- related kinases; ARKs) and the individual phosphorylation kinetics of the newly identified sites.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly NAFLD) is a leading global cause of chronic liver disease and is strongly associated with type 2 dia- betes. Progression to steatohepatitis with fibrosis (MASH) increases morbidity, yet no approved therapies currently exist. Peripheral sero- tonin (5-HT) signaling via the 5-HT receptor has been implicated in hepatic lipid accumulation and fibrogenesis. GM-60106 is a potent, selective peripheral 5-HT A antagonist with minimal CNS penetration. This study evaluated its therapeutic potential in preclinical MASLD models and a first-in-human Phase 1 trial.

**Materials and methods:**
GM-60106 was tested in murine MASLD/ MASH models, including STZHFD (steatohepatitis with fibrosis), car- bon tetrachloride (CCl )-induced injury, and bile duct ligation (BDL). Histological analysis included steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepat- ocyte ballooning, and fibrosis. In the STZHFD model, efficacy was compared to the thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist Resmetirom. A Phase 1 clinical trial assessed GM-60106 in three parts: Part A (single ascending doses, 2.5-160 mg), Part B (multiple doses, 20-60 mg), and Part C (28-day dosing in MASLD patients). Pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety were evaluated throughout.

**Results:**
GM-60106 significantly reduced hepatic steatosis, inflamma- tion, ballooning, and fibrosis in all preclinical models. In the STZHFD model, GM-60106 reduced the total NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) from 6.2 (vehicle) to 3.0, matching Resmetirom, and showed supe- rior fibrosis reduction (score 0.3 vs. 0.8). Similar improvements were observed in the CCl and BDL models, suggesting broad efficacy against both metabolic and fibrogenic pathways. In the Phase 1 trial, GM-60106 demonstrated dose-proportional PK and was well-tolerated across all doses. No dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related Grade ≥3 adverse events were reported. Most adverse events were mild to moderate gastrointestinal or CNS-related symptoms (e.g., nausea, headache) that resolved without intervention. No CNS effects were observed, consistent with peripheral restriction. Data from MASLD patients in Part C also confirmed a favorable safety profile with no new concerns.

**Conclusion:**
GM-60106, a novel peripheral 5-HT antagonist, shows strong therapeutic potential for MASLD by targeting serotonin- mediated hepatic steatosis and fibrogenesis. It demonstrated robust efficacy in multiple preclinical models and was safe and well-toler- ated in healthy volunteers and MASLD patients in a Phase 1 trial. These results support GM-60106 as a first-in-class oral candidate for MASLD/MASH and warrant further clinical evaluation in populations with metabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Glucagon regulates hepatic metabolism by stimulating gluconeogenesis and inhibiting lipogenesis; however, its role in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remains largely unknown. This study examines its dynam- ics during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in relation to hepatic steatosis and fibrosis severity. Bioinformatic analyses were also con- ducted using human liver transcriptomic data.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 137 participants who attended Severance Hospital were enrolled. Non-invasive hepatic steatosis and fibrosis indices, including the NAFLD Liver Fat Score and the Fibro- Scan-AST score, were calculated for each participant. Transient liver elastography data were available for 110 participants. Plasma gluca- gon levels during fasting and 2 hours after a 75 g OGTT were com- pared based on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis status. Glucagon receptor (GCGR) expression in liver tissue samples was analyzed across meta- bolic states using bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell transcriptomics to assess its association with MASLD severity.

**Results:**
Patients with severe hepatic steatosis (NAFLD Liver Fat Score >-0.64) had lower 2-h OGTT glucagon (211.0 vs. 285.5 pg/mL, p=0.016) and ΔGlucagon, defined as the difference between the 2-h OGTT value and the fasting value (41.0 vs. 75.5 pg/mL, p=0.012). Similarly, those with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) ≥260 dB/m had lower glucagon levels both at fasting (158.0 vs. 176.0 pg/mL, p=0.007) and at 2-h OGTT (211.0 vs. 306.0 pg/mL, p=0.001). Patients at higher risk of progressive metabolic dysfunction-associated stea- tohepatitis (FibroScan-AST score ≥0.35) also exhibited reduced 2-h OGTT glucagon (193.0 vs. 241.5 pg/mL, p=0.012). GCGR expression was lower in MASLD, particularly in hepatocytes, suggesting impaired glucagon signaling in disease progression.

**Conclusion:**
This study indicates that severe MASLD is associated with reduced glucagon secretion. In the era of glucagon agonist therapy for MASLD and obesity, further research is needed to elucidate the role of glucagon in metabolic disease development. Understanding the interplay between glucagon and hepatic lipid metabolism may provide novel insights into MASLD pathophysiology and help identify new therapeutic targets for this increasingly prevalent liver disease.

**Redox immunometabolism: NADPH oxidase 4 alleviates Stat6- deficiency-related metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in mice**

I. Szanto

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is characterized by a set of metabolic abnor- malities, such as pathological adipose tissue (WAT) accumulation, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Two major com- ponents linking pathological WAT function and MASLD to T2D are perturbed cellular redox homeostasis and the onset of chronic deregu- lation of inflammatory cell functions. NADPH oxidases (NOXs) pro- duce oxidants that control redox homeostasis and cytokine signaling in inflammatory cells. NOX4 modulates signal transduction of the tran- scription factor, Stat6 that relays anti-inflammatory actions of IL-4 and IL-13. Mice deficient in Stat6 display a predisposition towards the development of MASLD. The goal of our study was to investigate the effect of NOX4-mediated signaling in IL-4/IL-13-related processes in MASLD.

**Materials and methods:**
We created mice with double knock-out for NOX4 and Stat6 (DKO) and compared their metabolic phenotype to littermates with single NOX4 deletion (NOX4KO) upon 13-week high-fat diet feeding. Glucose and insulin sensitivity was determined by intra-peritoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Whole body metabolism was assessed in metabolic cages. Organs were processed for protein and gene expression analysis.

**Results:**
DKO and NOX4KO mice displayed similar food intake. By contrast, DKO mice displayed reduced adiposity compared to NOX4KO mice due to lower energy efficiency. DKO mice shifted lipid deposition away from the WAT and enhanced lipid storage in the liver. DKO mice displayed similar fed and starved glucose levels with no alterations in glucose tolerance. Gene expression analysis confirmed a less inflammatory state of both WAT and liver of DKO mice.

**Conclusion:**
Our results demonstrate that anti-inflammatory signaling is modulated by NOX4-derived oxidants in vivo in mice. In addition, they show that the interaction between NOX4 and IL-4/IL-13 is a sig- nificant modulatory component in the onset of MASLD.

**Background and aims:**
ESSENCE is an ongoing phase 3 RCT in participants with biopsy-defined metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and moderate-to-advanced fibrosis (F2 or F3). Part 1 reported positive efficacy on liver histology for the first 800 par- ticipants following 72 weeks’ treatment with semaglutide vs placebo. This analysis assessed the impact of baseline glycaemia on liver biomarkers and histology.

**Materials and methods:**
Participants randomised to once-weekly s. c. semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo were stratified into three groups: normoglycaemia (investigator-assessed non-T2D [NT2D] and baseline [BL] ­HbA ≤5.6%); prediabetes (investigator-assessed NT2D and BL ­HbA 5.7-6.4%); and T2D (investigator-assessed T2D, or investiga- tor-assessed NT2D and BL ­HbA ≥6.5%). Proportions of participants achieving specific liver-related responses at 72 weeks were evaluated, including: a ≥0.5 unit reduction in Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score; a ≥30% decrease in liver stiffness measurement by vibration- controlled transient elastography (VCTE LSM); and the two primary histological endpoints (MASH resolution without fibrosis worsening; fibrosis improvement without MASH worsening).

**Results:**
Participants received semaglutide or placebo (534 and 266, respectively); of these, 132 had normoglycaemia (90 and 42, respec- tively), 190 prediabetes (128 and 62, respectively), and 478 T2D (316 and 162, respectively) at baseline. Across nearly all glycaemia groups, significantly higher proportions of participants achieved ELF and VCTE LSM responses with semaglutide vs placebo (p=0.009- <0.0001), with greatest effects in the normoglycaemia group on ELF scores and the T2D group on VCTE LSM (Figure). Across glycemia groups, differences in responder proportions tended to favour semaglu- tide for the two primary histological endpoints, with the greatest effect in the normoglycaemia group (p<0.0001 for both endpoints).

**Conclusion:**
A benefit of semaglutide treatment on liver-related responses was seen across ELF, VCTE LSM and histological end- points, regardless of baseline glycaemia.

**KS-25, a newly developed synthetic TGF-β inhibitor, mitigates insulin resistance and liver steatosis in mice fed a high-fat diet**

K. Pahk

**Background and aims:**
Obesity-induced inflammation in visceral adi- pose tissue (VAT) triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, which in turn accelerate the progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β/Smad3 signaling pathway plays a critical role in mediating these inflammatory processes within VAT. In this study, we explore the potential therapeutic effects of KS-25, a novel synthetic verbenone derivative, in inhibiting TGF-β/Smad3 signaling to mitigate VAT inflammation, insulin resistance, and MASLD in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.

**Materials and methods:**
MASLD was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by administering a high-fat diet (60% fat) for 20 weeks. Throughout this period, KS-25 (50 mg/kg) was administered orally daily. In vivo VAT and systemic inflammation were assessed using ¹ F-fluorodeox- yglucose positron emission tomography and C-reactive protein levels. Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance were evaluated through insu- lin tolerance tests and glucose tolerance tests. Additionally, histologi- cal and molecular analyses were conducted on the harvested liver and VAT samples.

**Results:**
KS-25 effectively inhibited the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway, leading to a significant reduction in VAT inflammation and associated systemic inflammation induced by a high-fat diet. Addition- ally, KS-25 markedly enhanced insulin sensitivity, promoted glucose homeostasis, and alleviated hepatic steatosis. These findings suggest that KS-25 plays a crucial role in mitigating VAT inflammation and obesity-related MASLD.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings highlight the potential of KS-25 as a promis- ing therapeutic agent for obesity and associated MASLD, specifically through its action on inflamed VAT.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), including hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, is prevalent in individuals with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabe- tes (T2DM), contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. This study evaluated the effects of naltrexone/bupropion sustained release (NB) on hepatic steatosis and risk of hepatic fibrosis using non-invasive tests (NITs).

**Materials and methods:**
In this post-hoc analysis of a 56-week, dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 505 T2DM patients with overweight or obesity were randomized (2:1) to receive either NB or placebo, alongside standardized lifestyle interventions. Hepatic steatosis and risk of hepatic fibrosis were assessed using the Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI), the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, and the Metabolic Dysfunction- Associated Fibrosis 5 (MAF-5) index. Group differences were evalu- ated using t-tests, with subgroup analyses for ≥5% and ≥10% weight loss groups. Multiple regression models were employed to identify key factors influencing changes in HSI and MAF-5, including weight change, baseline glucose levels, ALT, and AST, selected for their rel- evance to MASLD progression.

**Results:**
Among 505 participants (56.4% female, mean age 53.8 ± 9.3 years, weight 104.5 ± 18.3 kg, BMI 36.4 ± 4.7 kg/m²), there was a significant decrease in HSI from 50.68 ± 5.9 to 47.73 ± 6.5 (p<0.001) in the NB group, and from 49.9 ± 5.7 to 48.7 ± 5.6 (p<0.001) in the placebo group. MAF-5 scores also decreased significantly, with the NB group showing a reduction from 3.13 ± 2.1 to 2.34 ± 2.1 (p<0.001) and the placebo group from 2.99 ± 1.8 to 2.69 ± 1.7 (p=0.006). Greater improvements were seen in the NB group com- pared to placebo (HSI: -2.94 vs. -1.18, p<0.001; MAF-5: -0.80 vs. -0.31, p=0.003). In contrast, no significant changes in FIB-4 were observed either within (NB: p=0.731, placebo: p=0.137) or between groups (p=0.217). Weight change was strongly correlated with reduc- tions in both HSI (r=0.796, p<0.001) and MAF-5 (r=0.488, p<0.001). Multiple regression analysis confirmed that weight change was the strongest predictor of improvements in both HSI (β=0.444, p<0.001) and MAF-5 (β=0.096, p<0.001). Subgroup analyses based on weight loss showed that in the ≥5% and ≥10% weight loss groups, the NB group had significantly greater reductions in ALT and AST compared to placebo (p<0.001 to p=0.027). No significant changes in ALT or AST were observed in participants with <5% weight loss, or in the placebo group.

**Conclusion:**
Naltrexone-bupropion treatment led to significant improvements in hepatic steatosis and fibrosis risk in T2DM patients with overweight or obesity. Weight loss emerged as the primary deter- minant of these improvements, particularly in individuals achieving ≥5% and ≥10% weight loss, highlighting the potential of weight man- agement in improving liver health in this population.

**Semaglutide-induced weight loss is the main determinant for the improvement of hepatic biochemistry and elastographic repeated measurements with FibroScan in patients with type 2 diabetes and MASLD**

I. Avgousti-Varela, Stergiou

**Background and aims:**
Semaglutide is currently being investigated for its effectiveness in MASLD (anticipated ESSENCE trial results), even though recent studies have concluded on its usefulness in MASH- related cirrhosis. Aim of this study was to examine the effect of sema- glutide on hepatic parameters of patients with T2DM and MASLD in real-world clinical practice, and to further assess the significance of weight loss during treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
In consecutive patients with T2DM and MASLD, hepatic biochemistry, non-invasive score of FIB-4 (= age x AST / platelets x √ALT), and elastographic measurements with ­FibroScan mini+430 (Echosens, Paris) of liver stiffness (LSM) and Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) were recorded before and after treatment with semaglutide. All participants had ultrasono- graphic evidence of fatty liver, while respective CAP measurements exceed 220 dB/m. Differences (Δ) were calculated as % percentages of (final - baseline) / baseline values. For within group comparisons, Wilcoxon Signed Ranked test for related samples was performed, while the effect of weight loss was investigated statistically with MANCOVA.

**Results:**
A total of 111 patients were investigated: 31 males (27.9%), mean age 56.4±9.7 years-old, ΒΜΙ 32.7±6.3 kg/m , median HbA1c 5.8% (IQR 5.6-6.2). Prevalence of metabolic factors: dyslipidemia 66.7%, obesity 64.9%, arterial hypertension 74.8%. Semaglutide (0.5-2.4mg/week sc.) was administered for a median of 12 months (IQR 6.6-17). Baseline lab: ΑST 26U/L (IQR 19-47), ALT 31U/L (IQR 22-81), γGT 45U/L (IQR 22-73), FIB-4 1.09 (IQR 0.78-1.38). Thirty-three patients (29.7%) had AST and/or ALT above upper limit of normal (ULN), and 35 (31.5%) FIB-4 >1.30 (cut-off for intermedi- ate/high-risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis). Apart from an overall drop in HbA1c of 5.6% (IQR 1.6-8.6) and weight loss of 10% (IQR 3.2- 19.6), statistical significant reductions were recorded in liver enzymes, and elastographic parameters [GRAPH]. Improvements in AST, ALT, γGT, LSM and CAP correlated independently to weight loss and semaglutide treatment duration (Pearson correlation, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis of covariance, weight loss was found to be asso- ciated with Δ_ALT (p=0.016), Δ_ΑST (p=0.001), Δ_LSM (p=0.030) and Δ_CAP (p=0.001), irrespective of treatment duration and baseline FIB-4 score.

**Conclusion:**
In this cohort of T2DM/MASLD patients with baseline satisfactory glycemic control, semaglutide-induced weight loss led to significant improvements of all hepatic parameters (biochemistry, liver stiffness and steatosis assessed with CAP), even in MASLD patients with baseline liver enzymes within normal. This study supports the advantages of semaglutide administration in T2DM patients with con- comitant MASLD of any stage.

**Significant weight reduction with improved body composition by HDM1005, a novel long-acting GLP-1R/GIPR dual agonist**

R. Zhu

**Background and aims:**
HDM1005 is a dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist, which potently activates GLP-1R and GIPR , and has demonstrated superior body weight reduction compared to Tirzepa- tide at equivalent doses in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. Clinical trials of GLP-1-based anti-obesity medications reported that about 25%-40% of the weight loss was composed of lean body mass (LBM) reduction. Here, we investigated changes in body composition (LBM or fat mass) and their contribution to weight loss in a MASH mouse model following 4-week treatment with HDM1005. Further- more, we assessed the therapeutic potential of HDM1005 in a separate MASH mouse model.

**Materials and methods:**
HDM1005 was evaluated on body weight, body composition, and food intake in DIO or MASH mice following 4-week treatment. In addition, its therapeutic potential in MASH was assessed in a GAN diet induced MASH mouse model, focusing on body weight, lipid metabolism, and the NAFLD activity score (NAS).

**Results:**
Following subcutaneous administration every three days (Q3D) for 28 days, HDM1005 exhibited significant body weight reduction (the percentage of weight loss on D28, HDM1005 was 39.97% Tirzepatide was 34.47%) in DIO mice. In MASH mice, HDM1005 preferentially reduced fat mass (FM), superior to Tirze- patide and Semaglutide at equivalent dose (FM loss contribution to total weight loss: HDM1005 81.58% Tirzepatide 77.44%, Semaglu- tide 71.80%), while lower LBM loss compared to Semaglutide (LBM contribution to total weight loss: HDM1005 10.60% Tirzepatide 10.16%, Semaglutide 17.53%). Additionally, HDM1005 significantly reduced hepatic total triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and improved NAS total score (2.50±0.68) in MASH mice, slightly sur- passing Tirzepatide (3.00±0.53) at matched dose, and significantly outperforming 3 mg/kg MGL-3196 (3.63±0.46).

**Conclusion:**
Collectively, HDM1005 achieves significant weight loss primarily through fat mass reduction (contribution to total weight loss: 81.58%). Notably, HDM1005 also exhibits promising therapeutic potential for MASH, highlighting its dual benefit in metabolic disease management.

**Association study of type 2 diabetes-related metabolic indices with metabolic dysfunction-association steatotic liver disease**

M. Hu

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has now become the most widespread chronic liver disease worldwide. This study aims to investigate the causal rela- tionships between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), glucose metab- olism-related indices(fasting insulin, fasting glucose, glycated hemo- globin, and 2-hour postprandial glucose) and MASLD by Mendelian randomization (MR). Furthermore, the study evaluates the predictive accuracy of multiple metabolic indices(VAI, TyG, HOMA-IR, BMI, LAP, WHtR, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR) in identifying MASLD among T2DM patients.

**Materials and methods:**
Summary-level data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on T2DM, glucose metabolism-related indices, and MASLD were obtained from the FinnGen and IEU data- bases. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with the exposure variables were selected as instrumental variables. The primary analysis was conducted using the Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method to investigate the causal effects of T2DM and glucose metabolism-related indices on MASLD. Complementary analyses, including MR-Egger regression, Weighted Median (WME), Simple Mode, and Weighted Mode, were performed to support the IVW results. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis assessed the influ- ence of individual SNPs on the IVW results. Horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity were evaluated using the MR-Egger intercept test and Cochran’s Q test to ensure the robustness of the findings. Potential biases were examined using funnel plots. In our cross-sectional study, 774 T2DM patients from the National Standardized Metabolic Diseases Management Center (MMC) database of a medical university hospital were included. All participants underwent abdominal ultrasonography and serum biochemical tests. Detailed demographic and anthropomet- ric data were collected for assessment. The associations between nine metabolic indices and MASLD were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. The predictive performance of these indices for MASLD was further assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and DeLong’s test.

**Results:**
Mendelian randomization results suggested that T2DM (IVW: OR = 1.14, P <0.05) and high fasting insulin (β = 1.32, P < 0.05) are high-risk factors for MASLD, demonstrating a causal association. In the study of 774 T2DM patients, 443 were diagnosed with MASLD. After adjusting for age and gender, all metabolic indices (VAI, TyG, HOMA-IR, BMI, LAP, WHtR, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR) showed significant positive correlations with the risk of MASLD. In the male subgroup, TyG-BMI exhibited the highest diagnostic efficacy (AUC = 0.82). Conversely, in the female subgroup, LAP demonstrated superior performance (AUC = 0.79). DeLong’s test further confirmed LAP’s excellent diagnostic performance for MASLD.

**Conclusion:**
Our study findings provide evidence that T2DM and high fasting insulin are high-risk factors for MASLD. Metabolic indices, including LAP, TyG-BMI, and TyG-WC, demonstrate good perfor- mance in predicting MASLD among T2DM patients. Compared to other metabolic indices (VAI, TyG, HOMA-IR, BMI, WHtR, TyG- BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR), LAP exhibited superior diagnos- tic performance in both male and female subgroups, highlighting its pivotal role and potential in diagnosing MASLD in T2DM patients.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. Cardiac remodeling associated with MASLD and its structural changes contribute to the development of heart fail- ure. Additionally, liver fibrosis is linked to poor prognosis in patients with heart failure who have preserved ejection fraction. This study aims to investigate the relationship between liver fibrosis, as determined by confirmed liver biopsy, and myocardial function

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 319 individuals (246 females, 70.5%) with morbid obesity who were undergoing bariatric surgery at the Center for Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery, Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital, were studied. Each patient underwent vibration-con- trolled transient elastography, echocardiography, and laboratory tests prior to surgery, and a liver biopsy was performed during the operation.

**Results:**
The mean body mass index (BMI) was 39.68 kg/m², with 145 cases of diabetes recorded. The fibrosis ≥2 (F2) group included 145 individuals, who were younger, had less body fat, and exhibited higher levels of AST and rGT compared to the fibrosis 0-1 (F0-1) group. A greater proportion of patients in the F2 group had diabetes (43% vs. 57%, P < 0.001) and had a higher Hb A1c (6.04 ± 0.98 vs. 6.78 ± 0.98, P < 0.001). The mean ejection fraction across all individuals was 61.49 ± 5.98, with no significant differences between groups (61.56 ± 5.90 vs. 60.91 ± 6.14, P = 0.347). However, the F2 group exhibited a higher E/e’ ratio, which is a marker of diastolic dysfunction (6.91 ± 1.7 vs. 7.4 ± 2.16, P = 0.028) with increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (diastolic interventricular septal thickness, 0.88 ± 0.14 vs. 0.93 ± 0.14, P=0.007; diastolic posterior wall thickness, 0.88 ± 0.12 vs. 0.93 ± 0.13, P<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Patients with fibrosis in MASLD shows higher E/e’ and LV thickness suggesting increased risk of heart failure regardless of LV systolic function.

**Background and aims:**
Prediabetes is a highly heterogeneous state between normoglycemia and diabetes. Metabolic dysfunction associ- ated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), also known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is characterized by increasing intrahepatic lipid accumulation and hepatic insulin resistance. Prediabetes is closely related to MAFLD, however, the association between different predia- betes phenotypes and MAFLD remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to explore the relationship and influencing factors between prediabetes with different phenotypes and extent of glucometabolic defects with MAFLD using mediation analysis.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a cross-sectional study based on Sports-and-Medicine Integrated Diabetes Prevention and Control Study. Subjects with prediabetes were classified as isolated IFG, iso- lated IGT, isolated IA1c and different combinations of glucometabolic defects. The extent of liver steatosis and stiffness were measured by iLivTouch using transient elastography.

**Results:**
Total of 1206 participants with prediabetes (276 without MAFLD and 930 with MAFLD) were included in the present study. The prevalence of MAFLD in prediabetes was 77.1%, The BMI, his- tory of hyperlipidemia, PPG and TG are independent risk factors for prediabetes complicated with MAFLD. However, BMI and TG are risk factors while HDL-C is a protective factor for prediabetes combined with liver fibrosis. Compared with isolated IFG, isolated IGT increased the risk of MAFLD (OR 1.78, 95%CI 1.1 to 2.89, P < 0.05). HbA1c- defined prediabetes had lower odds of MAFLD than FPG- and/ or 2h-PG-defined prediabetes (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.91). The odds of MAFLD was increased in prediabetes with increasing numbers of glucometabolic defects (all P< 0.05), with insulin resistance being the partial mediator.

**Conclusion:**
The association between MAFLD and different predia- betes phenotypes shows significant difference. Relative to HbA1c, elevated blood glucose might be a better predictor of MAFLD

**Background and aims:**
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are at the highest risk of developing severe metabolic dysfunction-asso- ciated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although all current guidelines recommend screening them with non-invasive tools, follow-up data are scarce. Our aim was to investigate the role of vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) as a monitoring tool for liver disease progression in a large cohort of T2D outpatients with MASLD.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 1,518 patients with T2D and sus- pected MASLD who were seen at a tertiary diabetes clinic and had serial valid liver stiffness measurements (LSM) using VCTE during their annual check-up between 2019 and 2024 were evaluated. The primary endpoint was the change in the 3 risk categories of liver dis- ease severity at follow-up (low: LSM < 8 kPa; intermediate: LSM 8-12 kPa; high: LSM ≥12 kPa). The secondary endpoint was an increase in LSM ≥ 30% at follow-up as the intrinsic variability of VCTE is of 30%. Factors independently associated with an increase in LSM ≥ 30% at follow-up were analyzed in a multivariate analysis.

**Results:**
The characteristics of the 1,518 patients were as follows: men 60.3%; median age 61 years [IQR 15]; diabetes duration 13 yrs [14]; BMI 28.9 kg/m² [6.9]; WC 103 cm [16]; HbA1c 7.5% [1.7]; LSM 5.6 kPa [3], and CAP 290 dB/m [78]). The median interval between two VCTE was 2.4 yrs [1.9]. Absolute median changes during follow- up were -0.5 kPa [2.2] for LSM and -0.73 kg/m² [2.1] for BMI. At baseline, 1,332 patients (88%) had LSM < 8 kPa, 111 (7%) had LSM between 8 and 12 kPa and 75 (5%) had LSM ≥ 12 kPa. Of the 1,332 patients with a baseline LSM < 8 kPa, 1133 (85%) remained in the same category at follow-up, 166 (12.5%) had a LSM between 8 and 12 kPa, and 33 (2.5%) had a LSM ≥ 12 kPa. Of 111 patients with a baseline LSM between 8 and 12 kPa, 48 (43%) remained in the same category at follow-up, 38 (34%) had a LSM < 8 kPa, and 25 (3%) had a LSM ≥ 12 kPa. Of 75 patients with a baseline LSM ≥12 kPa, 47 (63%) remained in the same category at follow-up, 21 (28%) had a LSM between 8 and 12 kPa, and 7 (9%) had a LSM < 8 kPa (Figure). At follow-up, 144 patients (9.5%) had an increase in LSM ≥ 30%, 1,046 (68.9%) had a change in LSM < 30%, and 328 (21.6%) had a decrease in LSM ≥ 30%. Age, duration of diabetes, BMI, HbA1c and GGT at baseline were independently associated with LSM increase ≥ 30%.

**Conclusion:**
Among patients with T2D and suspected MASLD, most patients remained in the same risk category according to LSM after 2.5 years of follow-up. Few patients showed LSM progression, which correlated with age, duration of diabetes, BMI, HbA1C, and GGT.

**Liver fibrosis independently predicts long-term mortality in indi- viduals with type 2 diabetes and MASLD: a single center study with 20-year follow-up**

I. Barchetta, M. Alfano, M.N. Hirsch, M.G. Cavallo

**Background and aims:**
Individuals with metabolic dysfunction-asso- ciated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with hepatic fibrosis being a key determinant of mortality. While CVD is traditionally considered the leading cause of death in T2D, growing evidence suggests that hepatic fibrosis may play a crucial role in determining long-term sur- vival, even in a cohort with a high cardiovascular burden. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of hepatic fibrosis, estimated using the Fibrotic NASH Index (FNI), to 20-year mortality risk in patients with T2D, after adjusting for established cardiovascular risk factors.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of 174 patients with T2D (baseline mean age: 67.6 ± 11.4 years, BMI: 29.3 ± 5.2 kg/m², HbA1c: 7.1 ± 1.7%), who were followed up for 20 years with complete recall for mortality. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by liver ultrasound, and fibrosis risk was estimated using the FNI, which has demonstrated strong predictive value for identifying liver fibrosis in populations at low risk of advanced liver disease, such as dysmetabolic cohorts. All patients underwent metabolic profiling and biochemical assessment, with baseline documentation of complica- tions and comorbidities.

**Results:**
At the baseline, liver steatosis was identified in 78% of par- ticipants. According to FNI classification, 44% of patients were at high fibrosis risk. Cardiovascular comorbidities were highly prevalent, with ischemic heart disease in 32.8%, previous myocardial infarction in 18.5%, hypertension in 71.3%, and stroke in 8.0% of study participants. At 20-year follow-up, the overall mortality rate was 39%. In this popu- lation, estimated advanced hepatic fibrosis (FNI > 0.33) emerged as the strongest independent predictor of 20-year mortality in the multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, BMI, liver steatosis, renal function (eGFR), ApoB levels, and prior CVD, with OR = 8.93, 95% CI: 1.82-38.85, p = 0.006.

**Conclusion:**
In our population of individuals with T2D at high car- diovascular risk, the presence of hepatic fibrosis represented a key determinant of long-term mortality, overshadowing traditional cardio- vascular risk factors. These findings support the strong contribution of liver fibrosis to excess mortality in T2D, and underscore the importance of early fibrosis assessment, also by non-invasive, easy, and accessible strategies such as the FNI calculation, for risk stratification in dysmeta- bolic patients to guide targeted preventive and therapeutic strategies.

**Association between increment of controlled attenuation parameter and the development of metabolic syndrome: a 6 year longitudinal study**

Y. Cao

**Background and aims:**
We previously showed that controlled attenu- ation parameter (CAP) measured by FibroScan is a convenient and sensitive non-invasive surrogate marker for early detection of metabolic derangement even in subjects with lower risk. This study explores the correlation between the increment of CAP and the risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS) over 6 years, and the progressive aggrega- tion of MetS components.

Triennial data were collected from medical staff physical examinations in our hospital in 2018 and 2021 as base- line, and 2024 as the follow-up endpoint. Anthropometrics, CAP, and laboratory assessments for metabolic profiles were collected. Logistic regression and generalized linear mixed model with restricted maxi- mum likelihood estimation was employed to characterize the associa- tion between the temporal changes in CAP and the risk of developing MetS.

**Results:**
Clinical data of 1205 subjects were collected in 2018 (n=901) and 2021 (n=304). 1018 of them were without MetS at base- line, and 230 subjects (22.6%) developed MetS during the follow-up. As compared to subjects without hepatic steatosis (CAP<238dB/m), the risks of developing MetS increased in subjects with mild (OR: 2.256, 95% CI: 1.310-3.885, p<0.001), moderate (OR: 2.297, 95% CI: 1.380- 3.825, p<0.001) and severe (OR: 4.946, 95% CI: 3.049- 8.023) hepatic steatosis. For every 10 dB/m increase in CAP, the risk of developing MetS increased by 22% (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18- 1.25; p<0.001), which was corresponding to the composite risk increment in each of the MetS component: abdominal obesity (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.32-1.46, p<0.001), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 1.27, 95% CI:1.10-1.16, p<0.001), decreased HDL-c (OR 1.28, 95% CI:1.19-1.36, p<0.001), hyperglycemia (OR 1.27, 95% CI:1.19-1.35, p<0.001), and hypertension (OR 1.13, 95% CI:1.10-1.16, p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
CAP is not only a sensitive indicator for metabolic derangement, it also captures the dynamic change in MetS compo- nents over the years, which could be used as a surrogate marker for the transition of metabolic health status.

**Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in type 1 diabetes: cross-sectional study compared to healthy controls**

S. Amuedo, Jiménez-Sánchez, N. Gros Herguido, G. López Gallardo, A. Piñar-, Gutiérrez, A. Soto-Moreno

**Background and aims:**
Emerging evidence suggests a growing burden of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) among people with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D). However, it remains unclear whether the prevalence of MASLD in PWT1D exceeds that observed in individuals without diabetes but with com- parable levels of adiposity. This study aimed to assess the preva- lence of MASLD in PWT1D using validated noninvasive markers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, and to compare these findings with those from metabolically matched healthy controls.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study including PWT1D and a control group of healthy participants matched for age and body mass index (BMI). Eligible participants were over 18 years old, and those in the PWT1D group had a dia- betes duration of more than 10 years. Participants with a history of alcohol consumption or known chronic liver disease were excluded from both groups. Visceral adipose tissue was measured by nutri- tional ultrasound in the midline, between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus. MASLD was evaluated using vibration-controlled transient elastography, with hepatic steatosis defined as a controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) ≥280 dB/m and liver fibrosis as a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥8 kPa.

**Results:**
A total of 85 PWT1D (48.2% women; median age 48.3 (39- 57) years; mean diabetes duration 28.8 ± 11.5 years; BMI 28.4 (25- 31) kg/m²) and 77 healthy controls (67.5% women; median age 49 (38-56) years; BMI 26.3 (24-32) kg/m²) were included. Compared to controls, the PWT1D group had a higher prevalence of hypertension (25.9% vs. 11.7%, = 0.022). While BMI and weight were similar between groups, visceral adipose tissue was significantly higher in PWT1D (0.9 vs. 0.5 cm, < 0.001), despite a lower waist circumfer- ence (93.2 vs. 99 cm, = 0.022). Regarding lipid profile, PWT1D had lower total cholesterol (169.8 vs. 198.5 mg/dL, < 0.001) and LDL (95.9 vs. 122.3 mg/dL, < 0.001), likely due to higher statin use (56.5% vs. 2.6%, < 0.001). Noninvasive scores of hepatic stea- tosis and fibrosis [(hepatic steatosis index (HSI), hepamet fibrosis score (HFS), and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS)] were significantly elevated in PWT1D (all < 0.05). LSM was also significantly higher in PWT1D (5.1 vs. 4.4 kPa, = 0.001), with 12.9% showing LSM ≥8 kPa compared to none in the control group ( = 0.001). Advanced steatosis (CAP ≥280 dB/m) tended to be more common in PWT1D (23.5% vs. 13%), although this difference did not reach statistical significance ( = 0.085).

**Conclusion:**
PWT1D exhibit a higher prevalence of MASLD and liver fibrosis compared to metabolically matched healthy controls, despite similar BMI.

**Background and aims:**
The relationship between skeletal mus- cle composition and MAFLD in individuals with impaired glucose metabolism remains understudied. This study aimed to examine the relationship between standardized skeletal thigh muscle area (cm2) and muscle radiodensity (Hounsfield Units, HU), and Metabolic- Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD)/hepatic radiodensity (HU).

**Materials and methods:**
To address this knowledge gap, a cross- sectional observational study was conducted using data from the SCAPIS-Gothenburg and IGT-Microbiota Study. Multivariable linear regression analyses were applied on data from 4620 participants (52% women, mean age 57.9 years). Confounder adjustments were computed in four theoretical models. Participants were classified into six groups based on fasting and 2-hour OGTT capillary plasma glucose: Normal glucose tolerance (NGT), subdivided by FINDRISC into low (<15 points) (1) and high (≥15 points) (2) 10-year T2D risk; isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG: fasting ≥6.1-<7.0 mmol/L, OGTT <8.9 mmol/L) (3); impaired glucose tolerance (IGT: fasting <6.1 mmol/L, OGTT ≥8.9-<12.2 mmol/L) (4); combined glucose intolerance (CGI: both IFG and IGT) (5); and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D: fasting ≥7.0 mmol/L or OGTT ≥12.2 mmol/L) (6)

**Results:**
Descriptive characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Thigh muscle area was highest in those with T2D (280 ± 61.4 cm²) and lowest in IGT (253.2 ± 58.2 cm²). Muscle radiodensity declined progressively across glucose groups, from 48 ± 3.3 HU in NGT-low FINDRISC to 44 ± 4.4 HU in T2D. A similar trend was observed for MAFLD prevalence and visceral fat, both highest in T2D (36.7% and 278.2 ± 115.3 cm²). Thigh muscle area was significantly associ- ated with hepatic attenuation across glucose groups (F-test < 0.001), with the strongest effect in CGI (B = -3.74, 95% CI -6.7 to -0.78). Weaker associations were seen in T2D (-2.11, -6.2 to 1.97), NGT- high FINDRISC (-1.62, -2.85 to -0.4), IFG (-1.30, -2.5 to -0.12), IGT (-0.57, -2.3 to 1.1), and NGT-low FINDRISC (-0.28, -0.75 to 0.2).

**Conclusion:**
Greater thigh muscle area was associated with increased liver steatosis, with the strongest relationship observed in individuals with combined glucose intolerance. These findings indicate that worsening glucose regulation is linked to higher vis- ceral fat accumulation, increased MAFLD prevalence, and reduced muscle radiodensity, underscoring the need for early intervention in the progression of glucose intolerance.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis increase fracture risk and reduce quality of life. The T-score, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), is the standard parameter for fracture risk assessment, but overestimates bone density in impaired glucose metabolism and doesn’t reflect bone microstructure. This study aimed to explore the trabecular bone score (TBS) as a marker of bone microstructure in relation to HbA1c and markers of metabolic dysfunc- tion-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD: Fib-4 score and AST to Platelet Ratio Index [APRI]).

**Materials and methods:**
Between October 2021 and December 2023, 190 people (49/141 male/female, age 65 [51/71] years, HbA1c 5.5 [5.2/5.8] %) were assessed for T-score on clinical indication. TBS was assessed retrospectively using TBS iNsight v3.1.2 software based on DEXA (Hologic Horizon W, Hologic GmbH, Germany). Both param- eters were measured between the first and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Subgroups were defined based on HbA1c (< 5.7% vs. ≥ 5.7%; n = 128/62) and Fib-4 (< 1.3 vs. ≥ 1.3; n = 95/95). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test, 2-way ANOVA, Fisher’s LSD test, Spearman correlation, and linear regression. All values are given as median [lower/upper quartile] and P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.

**Results:**
For individuals with HbA1c ≥ 5.7%, T-score remained unchanged, while TBS decreased by 3% (1.3 [1.2/1.4] vs 1.3 [1.2/1.3], P = 0.0300). Males with HbA1c ≥ 5.7% had a 70% higher T-score compared to those with lower HbA1c (-1.9 [-2.7/-0.8] vs -0.9 [-2.1/- 1.4], P = 0.0111), and 178% higher than females (-0.9 [-2.1/-1.4] vs -2.5 [-3.0/-1.3], P = 0.0002). No HbA1c-related differences were found in females, and no sex-specific differences were observed for TBS. At Fib-4 < 1.3, males had higher T-scores (40%, -1.4 [-2.5/-0.2] vs -2.2 [-2.8/-0.8], P = 0.0251) and TBS (5%, 1.4 [1.3/1.5] vs 1.3 [1.2/1.4], P = 0.0351) than females. Males with Fib-4 ≥ 1.3 had 6% lower TBS (1.4 [1.3/1.5] vs 1.3 [1.2/1.3], P = 0.0164). T-score correlated with HbA1c in males (R = 0.3936, P = 0.0051). In males, TBS correlates with Fib-4 (R = -0.3767, P = 0.0076) and APRI (R = -0.3868, P = 0.0060). In females, TBS correlated with age (R = -0.3232, P < 0.0001) and HbA1c (R = -0.2141, P = 0.0108). Regression analysis showed that HbA1c (β = 0.151, P = 0.044) and APRI (β = 0.292, P = 0.027) were predictive of T-score, with HbA1c also significant in males (β = 0.314, P = 0.045). For TBS, APRI in males (β = -0.702, P = 0.041) and age in females (β = -0.474, P < 0.001) were significant predictors.

**Conclusion:**
In males, the contrast between T-score and TBS in the presence of elevated HbA1c or Fib-4, along with the corresponding correlations, highlights the discrepancy between bone density and microstructure. In females, the decline in TBS with age and HbA1c underscores the progressive deterioration of bone microstructure with aging and poor glycaemic control, without further affecting T-scores. These findings emphasize the impact of impaired glucose metabolism and MASLD on bone health and stress the need for sex-specific consid- erations in diagnosing and treating individuals with metabolic diseases.

**Background and aims:**
The prevalence of metabolic dysfunction- associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is increasing globally with lim- ited treatment options. A common missense variant (rs2642438) in the mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing component 1 ( ) gene, that we and others have shown results in reduced MARC1 protein levels, confers protection against MASH and liver fibrosis. However, the mechanisms and whether silencing MARC1 in hepatocytes would impact established fibrosis remain unknown. We evaluated Marc1 siRNA treatment against benchmarks in a mouse model of MASH with liver fibrosis and in human 3D multicellular liver spheroids.

**Materials and methods:**
Male Gubra Amylin NASH (GAN) diet- induced obese (DIO)-MASH mice with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD Activity Score (NAS≥5) and fibrosis (stage F1-F3) were treated for 16 weeks ( =12-27 per group) with either: Vehicle A (s.c., Q3W), Control GalNAc-siRNA (4 mg/kg, s.c., Q3W), Marc1 GalNac-siRNA-1 (1 or 4 mg/kg, s.c., Q3W), Marc1 GalNac-siRNA-2 (4 mg/kg, s.c., Q3W), Vehicle B (s.c., QD), semaglutide (10 nmol/kg, s.c., QD), tirze- patide (10 nmol/kg, s.c., QD), Vehicle C (p.o., QD) or resmetirom (3 mg/kg, p.o., QD). We evaluated effects on histopathological scoring (pre- post-treatment), biomarkers, and global transcriptomics. Addi- tionally, was silenced using siRNA in 3D cultures of human hepatocytes and stellate cells to assess effects on lipid and collagen deposition as well as global transcriptional changes.

**Results:**
Robust liver target engagement was achieved with both tested Marc1 siRNAs (up to 92% mRNA knock-down control siRNA, <0.001) in GAN DIO-MASH mice. Hepatic silenc- ing decreased liver triglyceride content (up to 34% control siRNA, <0.01), but did not improve the NAS, fibrosis stage, or liver collagen levels. In contrast, treatments with benchmark semaglutide, tirzepatide, and resmetirom improved the NAS (all <0.05 vehi- cle). Mechanistically, Marc1 silencing reduced the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid metabolism (FAM) and induced genes in extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways, all in the opposite direction as compared to benchmark treatments. In 3D spheroids of human hepatocytes and stellate cells, MARC1 silencing reduced intracellular lipids but failed to reduce col- lagen levels. Transcriptionally, few ECM genes were downregulated and few OXPHOS genes were induced in human spheroids, indicating some translational differences between mice and an system with human cells.

**Conclusion:**
MARC1 has emerged as a promising target, based on human genetic studies, for treating MASH and liver fibrosis. Our find- ings show that silencing MARC1 can reduce liver lipid levels in a DIO-MASH mouse model and in 3D spheroids of human liver cells; however, fibrosis was unaffected. Therefore, the potential of a mono- therapy targeting MARC1 to impact on liver fibrosis remains uncertain.

**Spatial transcriptomics landscape of livers from patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis**

D. Lee

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steato- hepatitis (MASH) in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is characterized by concurrent liver inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, with approximately 40% of patients with MASH having fibrosis progression. Spatial heterogeneity in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) remains poorly under- stood. In the present study, we aimed to capture cell-specific alterations in the liver transcriptome associated with MASH and fibrosis progres- sion with spatial information.

**Materials and methods:**
Using the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, we performed spatial transcriptomics analysis on formalin-fixed, par- affin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissues from patients with MASLD. Our study included 16 patients with MASH at varying stages of fibrosis, which were further classified into “MASH-Low Fibrosis” (MASH- LF), corresponding to fibrosis stage less than F2 and “MASH-High Fibrosis” (MASH-HF), representing stages F3 or F4, and 8 individu- als without MASH (NonMASH). We acquired spatial transcriptomics data from three distinct types of regions of interest (ROIs) in the liver tissues, identified through staining for albumin, vinculin, and CD45, which localize hepatocyte-, HSC-, and immune cell-enriched ROIs, respectively. Additionally, we utilized sc/snRNA-Seq data from public datasets to validate the observed alterations in gene expression associ- ated with MASH and fibrosis. We also emphasized the translational implications of these molecular alterations, particularly in the con- text of bariatric surgery (BS) interventions, which can cause a marked improvement in MASLD and related metabolic factors. Moreover, we correlated MASH-related clinical outcomes with specific molecular alterations in different ROI types to assess the clinical significance of these changes.

**Results:**
We identified spatially distinct gene expression patterns and significant heterogeneity across regions of interest (ROIs) during MASH progression. Key findings included downregulation of fatty acid metabolism and urea cycle-related amino acid metabolism in all ROIs. The expression of cytochrome P450 genes in non-albumin- enriched (nonparenchymal) ROIs declined with MASH and fibrosis progression, which was confirmed through single-cell level RNA sequencing data. Furthermore, in these ROIs, several genes, includ- ing and were associated with MASH-related clinical parameters. Spatial analysis also revealed characteristic interactions between the three cell types through ligand-receptor pair interactions. Lastly, we validated MASH-associated gene expression alterations in these ROIs by analyzing a public RNA-Seq dataset from pre- and post- bariatric surgery and our bulk RNA-Seq data.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrate spatial heterogeneity in MASH progression, highlighting distinct gene expression patterns, metabolic pathway disruptions, and fibrosis-related alterations.

**SDF-1 mediated liver metabolic adaptation through CXCR7: impli- cations for mash pathogenesis**

K. Sharabi, Hadar

**Background and aims:**
The liver is a central metabolic organ cru- cial for whole-body glucose and lipid regulation, and its dysregula- tion is implicated in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the progression from metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This study aimed to elucidate the role of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 in hepatic metabolic adaptation and lipid homeostasis. While SDF-1 is well-known for its role in liver injury responses, its involvement in the metabolic adaptation of the liver remains unclear.

**Materials and methods:**
We employed a combination of mouse genet- ics, a diet-induced obesity model, and primary hepatocyte cultures. Hepatocyte-specific SDF-1 knockout mice (n=8-10 per group) were compared with control littermates following a Western diet feeding; additionally, hepatocyte-specific overexpression of CXCR7 or CXCR4 was achieved via adenoviral vectors. Quantitative PCR, histological analysis, and standard biochemical assays were performed.

**Results:**
Our findings demonstrate that glucagon stimulation of pri- mary hepatocytes robustly upregulated ACKR3/CXCR7 expression by approximately 10-fold (p<0.001), while insulin treatment suppressed CXCR4 expression by about 50% (p<0.01). In-vivo, SDF-1 expres- sion was significantly elevated in the refed state, and both SDF-1 and CXCR7 were markedly dysregulated in mice fed a Western diet (p<0.05). Hepatocyte-specific depletion of SDF-1 led to a ~50% increase in hepatic fat accumulation (p<0.05), and hepatocyte-specific overexpression of CXCR7 produced a comparable increase in hepatic lipid content. In contrast, overexpression of CXCR4 had no significant effect. The impact of the SDF-1 axis on lipid metabolism appears to be cell-autonomous, as overexpression of CXCR7 in isolated hepatocytes also resulted in increased fat accumulation. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling is reduced when CXCR7 is overexpressed, linking the SDF-1 axis to lipid metabolism.

**Conclusion:**
Together, these data highlight a central role for the SDF- 1, primarily via the CXCR7/ACKR3 axis, in regulating hepatic lipid homeostasis and metabolic adaptation. Targeting this pathway may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for managing liver metabolic dys- function and preventing the progression of MASH.

**Inhibiting 15-PGDH to ameliorate liver fibrosis in MASH: a novel therapeutic approach**

X. Li

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common liver disease globally and a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Untreated MASLD can progress to metabolic steatohepatitis (MASH) and hepa- tocellular carcinoma, with increased incidence in T2D patients. The enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) degrades eicosanoids like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which play a role in fibro- sis. SW033291, a 15-PGDH inhibitor, prevents PGE2 inactivation, potentially reducing liver fibrosis. We aimed to investigate whether inhibiting 15-PGDH with SW033291 could reduce liver fibrosis in MASH models.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a standard (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. 15-PGDH expression was evaluated in liver tissues using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and qPCR. In vitro, fibrosis was induced in LX-2 cells (hepatic stellate cells) with 10 ng/mL TGF-β, and steatosis was induced in THLE-2 (normal human hepatocytes) and HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma) cells with 0.6 mM palmitic acid. Cells were treated with 10 μM SW033291, and fibrosis markers (FN1, COL1A1, α-SMA) were assessed by qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. LX-2 cell proliferation was measured by the EdU assay, lipid accumulation in hepatocytes was assessed by Oil Red O staining, and cell viability was determined by the CCK-8 assay. Statistical significance was determined using Stu- dent’s t-test (p < 0.05).

**Results:**
In HFD-fed mice, liver expression of 15-PGDH increased ~2-fold (p < 0.05) compared to SD controls. In TGF-β-treated LX-2 cells, SW033291 significantly reduced FN1, COL1A1, and α-SMA expression (p < 0.05), and inhibited proliferation (p < 0.05). In HepG2 cells, SW033291 reduced lipid accumulation (p < 0.05). In THLE-2 cells, SW033291 enhanced cell viability (p < 0.05), with no effect on HepG2 or LX-2 cell viability.

**Conclusion:**
Inhibiting 15-PGDH with SW033291 effectively reduces liver fibrosis and steatosis in MASH models, presenting a novel thera- peutic strategy for T2D-associated MASH. Further in vivo studies are needed to validate its efficacy and explore the underlying mechanisms.

**Hepatic selenoprotein S knockout aggravates diet-induced MASLD through modulating LPC-autotaxin-LPA axis**

L. Qiao

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) represents a significant public health issue globally. Selenoprotein S (SelS) is highly expressed in the liver. Our findings showed hepatic SelS knockout ( ) exacerbates high- fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR), glucolipid metabolic disorders and hepatic steatosis. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of SelS on lipid deposition and IR was confirmed by SelS overexpression in primary hepatocytes in vitro. This study aims to characterized changes of lipid metabolites in the livers of mice by untargeted lipid- omic analysis in order to achieving a better understanding metabolic pathways involved in MASLD.

**Materials and methods:**
After 4 weeks of adaptive feeding, male and control mice were fed either a HFD or regu- lar chow (RC) for an additional 20 weeks. Liver tissues were then collected for untargeted lipidomics analysis to profile differential lipid metabolites. Quantitative measurements of hepatic lysophosphati- dylcholine (LPC) levels, as well as serum LPC, autotaxin (ATX), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and adiponectin were performed using mouse-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. RT-qPCR was employed to detect markers involved in LPC metabolism and LPA receptors. Western blotting was conducted to examine the protein levels of ATX and the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase (Erk) and per- oxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). All animal experi- ments were approved by the Animal Experimental Ethics Committee of our Medical University.

**Results:**
Untargeted lipidomics analysis revealed no significant dif- ferences in lipid metabolites between the and mice when fed a RC diet. However, under HFD feeding conditions, 160 lipid metabolites showed significant differences between the two genotypes, characterized primarily by upregulated triglycerides and downregulated LPCs in the livers of mice compared to mice. The study showed serum LPC concentrations were elevated in mice. Additionally, hepatic SelS knockout was found to suppress the expression of enzymes involved in LPC syn- thesis while promoting those responsible for LPC degradation. Consequently, hepatic LPC levels were reduced in S mice under HFD feeding conditions. Moreover, both Hepatic ATX mRNA expres- sion and protein levels, as well as serum ATX levels were increased in mice, which facilitated the conversion of LPC into LPA. As expected, serum LPA levels and LPA-binding G protein-coupled receptor expression were increased in mice, leading to Erk activation and PPARα inhibition, subsequently disrupted the FGF21- adiponectin axis, thereby contributing to the progression of MASLD.

**Conclusion:**
Hepatic SelS knockout may exacerbate diet-induced MASLD through the modulation of the LPC-ATX-LPA axis, then mediating liver-adipose tissue crosstalk to maintain glycolipid meta- bolic homeostasis via regulation of the FGF21-adiponectin axis.

**Proliferation/regeneration and apoptotic cell death in relation to RANKL/NF-κB-signaling in liver of rats with type 2 diabetes- associated MASLD and after vitamin D treatment**

O. Lisakovska, Veliky, I. Shymanskyi

**Background and aims:**
Growing evidence suggests a significant rela- tionship between low vitamin ­D (VD) and an increased risk of meta- bolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We hypothesized that VD may promote cell survival by modulating oxidative metabolism and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-related pro-/anti-inflammatory status in the diabetic liver. We investigated whether VD could influence NF-κB-mediated RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) signaling and how this might affect hepatocellular proliferative activity and apoptosis in T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
T2DM was induced in male Wistar rats (215.0±12.0 g) kept on a high-fat diet for 3 months followed by a low-dose STZ injection (25 mg/kg b.w.). T2DM rats were divided into 2 groups, treated with/without VD (1000 IU/kg b.w., 30 days). MASLD was assessed histologically (Sudan III&Gill’s Hematoxylin II and AFOG). We used western blotting to determine RANKL, NF-κB subunits, inhibitor of κB (IκB)-α, and molecular markers of apoptosis. The number of apoptotic cells in liver histological sections was studied by the TUNEL. Proliferating cells were evaluated using double immu- nofluorescent labeling with Ki67 and marker proteins of hepatocytes and monocyte/macrophage cells ­(ASGR1 and F4/80 ).

**Results:**
T2DM caused dyslipidemia and increased number/size of lipid droplets in hepatocytes without evidence of liver fibrosis. Acti- vation of the NF-κB signaling cascade in T2DM was confirmed by upregulated expression of p65 and p52 NF-κB subunits (1.5- and 1.7-fold, respectively), a 1.4- and 2.3-fold elevation of phospho- p65 (at Ser311) and phospho-IκB-α (at Ser32/Ser36), respectively, in liver tissue compared to the control (p<0.05). VD significantly reduced the synthesis of p52 and p65 subunits, phosphorylated p65 and IκB-α levels. T2DM-induced NF-κB cascade activation corre- lated with higher RANKL expression that was partially compensated by VD treatment. NF-κB-mediated liver changes in T2DM paralleled a 3.4-fold increase in the number of apoptotic ­TUNEL cells vs. the control group (p<0.05). Based on the study of molecular markers of apoptosis, it was shown that programmed cell death is realized due to the activation of both the receptor (external) pathway of apop- tosis initiation, a marker of which is a raise in caspase-8, and the internal (mitochondrial) pathway (increased levels of caspase-3 p17 fragment and Bax/Bcl-2) with additional participation of AIF. The possible role of the adapter protein p66Shc in oxidative stress and apoptosis was excluded. We also found that diabetic MASLD was accompanied by a 1.9-fold suppression of the number of ­Ki67 (pro- liferating) cells, mainly hepatocytes (p<0.05). VD treatment slightly suppressed the level of apoptotic cell death, while simultaneously enhancing proliferative activity.

**Conclusion:**
T2DM-related liver failure involves activation of NF-κB-mediated RANKL signaling and is accompanied by impaired hepatocellular proliferation/regeneration with increased apoptosis, which can be counteracted by VD. The findings may have novel implementation for preventive strategies against T2DM-associated MASLD.

**Proteomic signature of extracellular vesicles secreted by hepatic stellate cells at different states**

L. Balazova, Balaz

**Background and aims:**
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a poten- tial source of biomarkers due to their stability, abundance and molecular cargo they carry while reflecting current functional status of the cell of origin. To date, there is no specific, sensitive and non-invasive bio- marker available to diagnose Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and particularly its progression to steatohepatitis and fibrosis (MASH). The aim of our study was to perform untargeted identification of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) derived EVs surface pro- teins to propose specific EVs subpopulations mirroring liver fibrosis as perspective circulating MASH biomarker.

**Materials and methods:**
EVs secreted by primary human quiescent HSCs and TGFβ activated HSCs with pro-fibrogenic phenotype were isolated from cell conditioned medium by size exclusion chromatogra- phy and validated by transmission electron microscopy. Surfaceome of EVs was defined by click chemistry based protein purification coupled to mass spectrometry to detect glycosylated membrane proteins.

**Results:**
Electron microscopy confirms purity and integrity of iso- lated EVs by our protocol. Protein identification analysis discovered 111 surface proteins identified with at least 2 unique peptides on HSCs derived EVs independently of HSCs phenotype (3 technical replicates for both groups) Among these, several proteins (namely A2MG, ALBU, ANXA2, CD63, EF1A1 or SDCB1) belong to top 100 most frequently identified EV-associated proteins according to Vesiclepedia, which validates accuracy of our approach. Moreover, relative quantitative comparison revealed 32 abundant surface proteins (enrichment factor of log2(FC) ≥ 2 and -log10 adjusted p-value ≥ 2), significantly differ- ent between EVs released by quiescent and activated HSCs. The most enriched protein was ICAM1 (Log2 FC 6.0, q Value 2.35 E-07) and FABP5 (Log2 FC 4.7, q Value 3.61 E-08) in quiescent and activated HSCs, respectively. Of note, pathway analysis of differentially abundant proteins by Reactome database identified extracellular matrix organisa- tion and cytokine signalling as altered biological processes in response to HSCs activation thereby further validating our analysis.

**Conclusion:**
Activation of hepatic stellate cells into pro-fibrogenic phe- notype is associated with altered proteomic signature of secreted EVs. Deciphering the surfaceome of EVs will enable us to track specific subpopulations of individual cell types implicated in various disease pathogenesis even in such complex sample as peripheral blood. This is particularly of interest in metabolic diseases, including MASH, in which circulating milieu mirrors metabolic disarrangement of multiple organs.

**Background and aims:**
While the cardiovascular benefits of semaglu- tide are well-recognized, its impact on surrogate markers of vascular health and liver function has yet to be fully understood. This study was designed to evaluate the vascular, endothelial and hepatic effects of semaglutide in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 75 consecutive patients diagnosed with both T2DM and MASLD were included in this investigation. Among them, 50 patients were administered semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg (treatment group), while 25 patients were treated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (control group). We measured perfused boundary region (PBR) of the endothelial glycocalyx, central systolic blood pressure (SBP), augmentation index (AIx) and pulse wave veloc- ity (PWV), along with Fibroscan elastography, at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months following enrollment.

**Results:**
Semaglutide treatment significantly reduced the Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) score, E fibrosis score, Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, and PBR at both 4 and 12 months (p < 0.05), unlike the con- trol group. Furthermore, patients in the semaglutide group exhibited a more pronounced decrease in central SBP, (-6% vs. -4%, p = 0.048 at 4 months; -11% vs. -9%, p = 0.039 at 12 months), AIx (-59% vs. -52%, p = 0.041 at 4 months; -70% vs. -57%, p = 0.022 at 12 months), and PWV (-6% vs. -3.5%, p = 0.019 at 4 months; -12% vs. -10%, p = 0.036 at 12 months) relative to controls. Notably, changes in PWV and PBR were significantly correlated with parallel reductions in CAP, E, and FIB-4 scores across the entire study population.

**Conclusion:**
Twelve months of semaglutide treatment yields con- current improvements in vascular stiffness, endothelial function, and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis among patients with T2DM and MASLD, highlighting its potential role in comprehensive cardiometabolic and hepatic risk reduction.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity and diabetes are associated with meta- bolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). How- ever, it remains unclear whether impaired metabolic function of adi- pose tissue promotes MASLD progression independently of fat mass.

**Materials and methods:**
Obese individuals scheduled for bariatric sur- gery (n=115, 26/89 men/women, BMI 45.6±5.8 kg/m², age 45.6±11.4 years) were categorized based on their glucose metabolism into three groups: normal glucose-tolerance (NGT, n=40), prediabetes (PD, n=43), and type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=32). Laboratory tests, liver elas- tography, and histological analysis of intraoperatively obtained liver samples (n=67) were performed. Adipose tissue insulin resistance (Adipo-IR), an established biomarker, was determined as the product of fasting plasma insulin and free fatty acids [pmol/L × mmol/L]. Mark- ers of MASLD and liver fibrosis (Fatty Liver Index [FLI], Fib-4 score, NAFLD score, Controlled Attenuation Parameter [CAP], liver stiffness) were analyzed. Liver samples were assessed using the SAF score for steatosis, activity, and fibrosis. Data analysis included Spearman cor- relation, Wilcoxon test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann-Whitney U test.

**Results:**
Adipo-IR correlated with FLI (R=0.456; P<0.0001) and CAP (R=0.323; P=0.002), but not with Fib-4 (R=0.142; P=0.147), NAFLD score (R=0.116; P=0.236), or liver stiffness (R=0.18; P=0.094). CAP correlated with FLI (R=0.370, P=0.0004) and histological steatosis score (Score 0 vs. 1: P=0.354, Score 0 vs. 2+3: P=0.0004, Score 1 vs. 2+3: P=0.056). Adipo-IR was elevated in higher steatosis scores (Score 0: 54.8 [31.3/96.01]; Score 1: 79.9 [64.0/100.3]; Score 2+3: 113.7 [82.2/141.7] pmol/L × mmol/L; Score 0 vs. 1: P=0.135; Score 0 vs. 2+3: P=0.0004; Score 1 vs. 2+3: P=0.133) but was not associated with higher activity (P=0.377) or fibrosis scores (P=0.624). Similar correlations of Adipo-IR with MASLD markers were observed in NGT (FLI: R=0.361; P=0.022; CAP: R=0.357; P=0.053; steatosis score: P=0.012) and PD (FLI: R=0.055; P=0.0002; CAP: R=0.372; P=0.028; steatosis score: P=0.023), but not in T2D (FLI: R=0.320; P=0.127; CAP: R=0.204; P=0.350; steatosis score: P=0.266). Six months after bariatric surgery, Adipo-IR decreased by 59% (P<0.0001), with a stronger reduction in higher steatosis scores (P=0.0004), while remaining unchanged in higher activity (P=0.654) and fibrosis scores (P=0.583).

**Conclusion:**
Insulin resistance in adipose tissue correlates with mark- ers of liver steatosis but not with markers of liver fibrosis. No sig- nificant correlation was found in the T2D subgroup, whereas Adipo- IR serves as an early marker for steatosis in obesity and prediabetes. Reduced inhibition of lipolysis and increased insulin-induced stimula- tion of lipogenesis in adipose tissue may promote substrate flow from adipose tissue to the liver, thereby contributing to steatosis develop- ment. Liver fibrosis might reflect a metabolic state with reduced revers- ibility within six months after bariatric surgery.

**Background and aims:**
MASLD is the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide. Research shows dietary patterns and macronutri- ents can impact intrahepatic lipids (IHL) in short-term trials. We have shown that a diet high in protein, unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and fiber reduce IHL in a 36-month randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) in the elderly. We now aimed to ascertain the role of macronu- trients as key mediators of changes in IHL.

**Materials and methods:**
A 36-month RCT was conducted. 502 Partic- ipants were allocated to a control group which followed dietary recom- mendations from the German Society of Nutrition (fat 30% total energy intake (%E), carbohydrates 55%E, protein 15%E) or an intervention group. The latter received a dietary pattern emphasizing high intake of plant protein (15-25%E), monounsaturated fatty acids (15-20%E), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (10-15%E) and fiber (≥ 30g/ day). IHL were determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mediation analyses were carried out to determine the role of changes in macro- nutrients and in BMI on IHL.

**Results:**
IHL improvement was greater in the intervention group, as previously shown. Both groups also showed a similarly small decrease in BMI (-0.22 in the control and -0.38kg/m in the intervention group). At 36 months participants with protein consumption in the fourth quar- tile (Q4) showed the highest decline in IHL, -0.45 (95% CI -0.30 — -0.12, p=0.008). The same was true for PUFA, -0.39 (95% CI -0.70 — -0.07, p=0.016). Carbohydrate consumption in Q3 was related to the lowest decline in IHL, 0.34 (95% CI 0.02 — 0.67, p=0.040). Increased PUFA and protein intake directly mediated IHL reduction independently of BMI changes by -0.008, (95% CI -0.0183 — -0.0057, p=0.030) and -0.035, (95% CI -0.0705 — -0.0078, p=0.002) respec- tively, and also through changes in BMI.

**Conclusion:**
High intake of PUFA and protein improves IHL over 36 months. PUFA and protein intake were identified as key mediators of this improvement both comprising weight loss dependent and inde- pendent effects. These results emphasize the importance of nutrition in the long-term prevention and treatment of MASLD.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver (MASLD) is often concomitant with carbohydrate metabolism disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetic condition. However, specific data on the effect of MASLD on the markers of metabolic control in patients with prediabetes are lack- ing. Obtaining such data will allow to estimate the metabolic risk and establish a diagnostic model in this group of patients.

**Materials and methods:**
For this purpose, 80 consecutive patients with prediabetes (54/26 female/male, aged 52.72±13.25), diagnosed on the basis of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were enrolled in the study. The patients were assigned to numerically comparable groups with and without MASLD diagnosed on the basis of liver ultrasound, Hepatic Steatosis Index and Fatty Liver Index as well as the current EASL-EASD-EASO criteria. Each patient underwent anthropomet- ric measurements, determinations of blood pressure (BP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), lipid profile and insulin. On the basis of the obtained results, the body mass index (BMI), waist-to hip ratio (WHR) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were calculated.

**Results:**
In the group of patients with MASLD, significantly higher values of all anthropometric parameters as weel as BP were observed. Additionally, the patients with MASLD had significantly higher ALT, AST, GGTP, triglycerides and lower high-density lipoproteins value. Taking into consideration the markers of carbohydrate metabolism, higher fasting insulin level and HOMA-IR were found in the MASLD group (table 1). However, no differences were found in HbA1c, fasting (FPG) and 2-hour plasma glucose levels (2hPG) with more frequent diagnoses of prediabetes among patients with MASLD (32 patients had FPG >100mg/dl, 20 patients had 2hPG >140mg/dl, and 12 of them had both FPG >100mg/dl and 2hPG >140mg/dl) (vs. 34, 13 and 8 patients without MASDL respectively). HOMA-IR >2.5 was reported in 38 patients with MASLD (vs. 65% without MASLD). In addition, a posi- tive correlation between 2hPG and insulin levels (R=0.322; p<0.05), HOMA-IR (R=0.316; p<0.05) and HbA1c (R=0.359; p<0.05) was found in the group of patients with MASLD. In contrast, in the non- MASLD group, only a positive slight corrleation between the 2hPG and the HOMA-IR (R=0.354; p<0.005) was observed.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that MASLD exacerbates meta- bolic dysfunction in patients with prediabetes. as well as that the OGTT must be performed as the main diagnostic and prognostic tool in this group of patients.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a liver disease characterized by fat accumulation and is often associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Recent stud- ies suggest that sex may influence disease progression, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to assess the sex-specific effects of different diets inducing MAFLD and the subse- quent treatment with the PPARα agonist elafibranor, which has shown promising results in reducing disease severity and improving glucose homeostasis.

**Materials and methods:**
The study was conducted on male and female mice. Two dietary models were used to induce MAFLD : a specific CDAA/HFD diet, which is choline-deficient, rich in amino acids (leu- cine), and high in fat, and a combination of fructose/glucose-rich and high-fat diets (HFCD-HF/G). Mice were divided into groups based on sex and diet type. After the MAFLD induction period, a subset of each sex and dietary group was treated with elafibranor for three weeks. Fol- lowing treatment, various metabolic tests were performed, including oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT). Liver samples were collected post-sacrifice for histological assessment of steatosis and hepatic fibrosis.

**Results:**
In the HF-CD diet group, elafibranor treatment in females more effectively reduced fat mass and significantly increased lean mass (fat mass in males, p = 0.0062; fat mass in females, p = 0.0032; lean mass in males : NS, lean mass in females, p = 0.0045 before vs. after treatment). Regarding metabolic parameters, both diets didn’t induce significant sex differences in OGTT or ITT results (NS). However, glucose tolerance improved significantly in elafibranor-treated groups compared to untreated controls, irrespective of sex. Nevertheless, glu- cose intolerance remained significantly higher in males than in females post-treatment (ANOVA before vs. after, P = 0.0735 in males; P = 0.0567 in females). Notably, the treatment significantly reduced the area under the glucose curve (AUC) during OGTT only in females (AUC before treatment: 28,922 ± 2,420 vs. AUC after treatment: 22,234 ± 719 mg/min*dL; T-test, p = 0.0218). Finally, hepatomeg- aly was significantly more pronounced in HF-CD-fed treated groups compared to untreated groups, with a similar profile in both males and females (Ordinary one-way ANOVA, P < 0.0001).

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights a pronounced sex-specific effect on MAFLD progression and response to elafibranor treatment. Females exhibited better glucose tolerance post-treatment, with a significant increase in lean mass accompanying fat mass reduction. No effect was observed on insulin sensitivity. Hepatomegaly, exacerbated by treatment, was equally present in both sexes, raising concerns about potential long-term effects. These findings emphasize the importance of considering sex differences in MAFLD treatment strategies.

**Background and aims:**
The pathophysiology of metabolic dysfunc- tion-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remains unclear. Recent studies have shown that the severity of MASLD associates with a high plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate-to-acetoacetate ratio (bOHB/ AcAc), a well-established marker of hepatic mitochondrial reductive stress. Here, we investigated whether intravenous administration of fatty acids and ethanol - two key risk factors of SLD - induce hepatic mitochondrial reductive stress in humans. Furthermore, we tested whether the stable isotope tracer C-alpha-ketoisocaproate ( C- KIC), whose catabolism in hepatic mitochondria produces CO and isovaleryl-CoA in a reductive stress-dependent manner, is applicable for studying hepatic mitochondrial reductive stress in humans.

**Materials and methods:**
On three separate days after an overnight fast, 12 healthy volunteers (5 female, 7 male, age 26.8 ± 3,1 years, BMI 23.1 ± 0.8 kg/m , liver fat 1.11 ± 0.17 %) received, in a ran- dom order, 240-minute volume-controlled infusions of either: a) a lipid emulsion (Intralipid 20 % with heparin, ‘IL/Hep’), b) 6 % ethanol (‘EtOH’), or c) saline. Breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) was clamped to 60 mg/dl using a breathalyzer and a physiologi- cally based pharmacokinetic model-based algorithm. One hour after starting the infusions, the participants ingested a tracer dose of C- KIC (1 mg/kg) and L-leucine (20 mg/kg). Breath samples were col- lected for determination of CO production using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Cumulative CO ( C ΔPDB) areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Arterialized plasma samples were taken for colorimetric determination of bOHB/ AcAc and for targeted metabolomics using liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry.

**Results:**
IL/Hep infusion increased circulating fatty acid concentra- tions from 0.42 ± 0.05 to 1.34 ± 0.10 mmol/l at 60 minutes and 1.56 ± 0.11 mmol/l at 240 minutes. EtOH infusion increased BrAC to 60 mg/dl in 30 minutes, remaining at a steady state of 61.0 ± 0.1 mg/dl between 30 and 240 minutes. Plasma bOHB/AcAc increased from baseline by 59 % during IL/Hep (p = 0.002) and by 109 % during EtOH infusion (p = 0.01). Compared to saline infusion, CO ( C ΔPDB) AUC was 26 % lower during IL/Hep (p < 0.0001) and 25 % lower during EtOH infusion (p = 0.0016). Relative to saline infusion, plasma concentrations of isovalerylcarnitine, a breakdown product of KIC, were 24 % lower during IL/Hep and 25 % lower during EtOH infusions.

**Conclusion:**
Physiological increases in circulating fatty acids and ethanol - two key risk factors of SLD - induce hepatic mitochondrial reductive stress, as determined by increased plasma bOHB/AcAc and decreased CO production after ingestion of C-KIC. C-KIC breath test is a useful noninvasive method for the study of hepatic mitochon- drial reductive stress.

**Cortisol metabolism in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease with type 2 diabetes**

F.C.K. Ng

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a common disease worldwide. Its burden is even higher in patient with type 2 diabetes. Despite circulating serum cortisol levels are usually normal in most cases, alternation in corti- sol metabolism has been described in patients with MASLD in some small-scales studies. We assessed the changes in cortisol metabolism in diabetic patients with MASLD, focusing on 11β-hydroxysteroid dehy- drogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) activity, 5α reductase (5αR) activity and urinary total cortisol metabolites (FM).

**Materials and methods:**
In the diabetic clinic of a local tertiary center, we performed transient elastography to grade the degree of liver stea- tosis (S0 to S3) in non-alcoholic patients with type 2 diabetes. We analyzed their urine steroid profile by gas chromatography-mass spec- trometry (GC-MS). 11β-HSD1 activity, 5αR activity, and FM were analyzed with reference to age- and sex-specific lower (R1) and upper limits of normal (R2).

**Results:**
Among the 50 patients, 25 (50.0%) were diagnosed with advanced liver steatosis (S2 or S3). Subjects with advanced liver stea- tosis demonstrated significantly higher daily FM (daily FM (p = 0.015), FMR1 (p = 0.020) and FMR2 (p = 0.037)), despite similar urinary free cortisol level. The adjusted odds ratio for advanced liver steatosis was 1.14 (1.01-1.28, p = 0.035) for an increase of each mg of total cortisol metabolites per day. There was no association between liver steatosis and 11β-HSD1 activity or 5αR activity in our cohort.

**Conclusion:**
This study showed that the cortisol metabolism pathway is altered in MASLD, as indicated by increased total cortisol metabo- lites. Total cortisol metabolites can be used to predict risk of advanced liver steatosis. Future studies on cortisol metabolism in MASLD or other metabolic diseases should assess total cortisol metabolites, which reflect both cortisol production and excretion rates, rather than focusing on cortisol levels alone.

**Background and aims:**
Increased intestinal permeability has been described in individuals with obesity and metabolic disease and evidence pointed to its contribution to chronic inflammation and metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, the relationship between gut permeability and liver fibrosis is still under debate, as is its independency from metabolic risk fac- tors. Therefore, aim of this study was to investigate the association between biomarkers of gut permeability and presence of MASLD in relation to liver disease severity and metabolic phenotype in indi- viduals with and without obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

**Materials and methods:**
For this study, we recruited 139 subjects (mean ± SD age: 48.8 ± 11 years; M/F 60/79; BMI: 33.7 ± 9.5 kg/m²; 57% with obesity, 50% with type 2 diabetes) referring to the Diabe- tes outpatient clinic. Liver fibrosis was estimated with the Fibrotic NASH Index (FNI) and steatosis by Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI). In a subgroup of patients undergoing bariatric surgery for clinical indications, liver fibrosis was also evaluated histologically using the NAS and SAF scoring systems. Gut permeability and endotoxemia were evaluated by measuring soluble CD14 (sCD14), LPS Bind- ing Protein (LBP), LBP/sCD14 ratio, and Granzyme-B levels using ELISA kits.

**Results:**
One hundred-eight out of 139 study participants (78%) had a diagnosis of MASLD, and advanced liver fibrosis (FNI > 0.33) was estimated in approximately 21%. Among markers of gut permeability, bivariate correlation analyses showed a significant association between sCD14 and both HSI (r = 0.26, p = 0.005) and FNI (r = 0.29, p = 0.007). LBP significantly correlated with HSI (r = 0.48, p < 0.001), but not with FNI. LBP/CD14 ratio also correlated with HSI (r = 0.27, p = 0.020), Granzyme B was associated with FNI (r = 0.52, p = 0.0016). In the multivariable logistic regression models, sCD14 levels predicted advanced liver fibrosis with OR= 16.4 (95% CI 1.1-242.5) after adjust- ing for BMI, waist circumference, age, sex, and T2D. The independent association between sCD14 levels and fibrosis was confirmed by liver histology (p = 0.02).

**Conclusion:**
In our population, sCD14 levels independently associated with liver fibrosis, both estimated and histologically confirmed, in indi- viduals with MASLD and metabolic disease. These findings support a role for impaired gut permeability and the subsequent immune-inflam- matory response in the progression of MASLD, and suggest sCD14 as a promising non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis in this population.

**Disruption in bile acids metabolism and increased risk of liver fibrosis in women with high metabolic risk: a metabolomic analysis from Qatar Biobank**

M. Barigou

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic hepatitis (MASH) is a major contributor to liver fibrosis and meta- bolic disease progression, particularly among women of reproductive age. Bile acid metabolism plays a pivotal role in liver function, and its disruption may reflect gut microbiota alterations that contribute to disease risk. This study compares primary and secondary bile acid profiles between women with high risk of MASH (Fib-4 >1.4) and lower-risk counterparts (Fib-4 <1.3) to investigate potential links to liver fibrosis and type II diabetes development.

**Materials and methods:**
A metabolomic analysis of plasma samples from women in the Qatar Biobank cohort (mean age: 40 years, 95% CI: 39-40) was performed. Participants were classified as high-risk MASH (Fib-4 >1.3) or low-risk (Fib-4 <1.3). Bile acid concen- trations were quantified, and percentage differences were analyzed to assess metabolic alterations. Statistical significance was set at p<0.01.

**Results:**
Women at high risk of fibrosis exhibited significant altera- tions in bile acid metabolism. Secondary bile acids revealed dysbiosis- related disruptions, with taurochenodeoxycholic acid 3-sulfate show- ing the highest increase (+81.4%, p<0.01), followed by deoxycholic acid glucuronide (+57.7%, p<0.01) and glycolithocholate (+37.3%, p<0.01). Meanwhile, deoxycholate (-5.7%, p<0.01), taurodeoxy- cholic acid 3-sulfate (-16.1%, p<0.01), and ursodeoxycholate (-13.0%, p<0.01) exhibited significant reductions, suggesting impaired bile acid clearance and altered microbiome activity.

**Conclusion:**
Bile acid metabolism is significantly disrupted in women with high metabolic risk, characterized by altered secondary bile acid profiles. This suggests hepatic dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbio- sis, both contributing to liver fibrosis progression and increased type II diabetes risk. These findings highlight bile acid profiling as a potential biomarker for early disease detection and targeted metabolic interven- tions in high-risk female populations.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a severe form of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Roux-en-Y gas- tric bypass (RYGB), a bariatric surgery for morbid obesity, effectively reduces weight and improves obesity-driven conditions, including liver disease. However, the mechanisms by which RYGB impacts MASH progression remain unclear. This study aims to identify factors mimick- ing RYGB’s effects and develop novel therapeutic strategies for MASH.

**Materials and methods:**
Wistar rats underwent RYGB surgery, and small intestinal tissues were collected for RNA sequencing to iden- tify differentially expressed genes encoding secreted proteins. Protein expression of selected candidates was validated using ELISA in portal vein plasma. To assess therapeutic potential, a mouse model of MASH was established through a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet.

**Results:**
After feeding rats with a high-fat diet for 16 weeks, Roux-en- Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery was performed. Eight weeks post- surgery, RNA sequencing was conducted on the jejunum (Alimentary limb) and ileum (Common limb). Among these, secreted genes were filtered, and a list of genes secreted into the bloodstream or surround- ing tissues was collected. Stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) was identified as a significantly upregulated gene, showing an 17-fold increment (LogFC). Blood samples from the portal vein of the RYGB group revealed a significant increase in STC-1 protein levels (p<0.05). To evaluate the effect of STC-1 on MASH and fibrosis, inflammation was induced using LPS in the mouse monocyte cell line (Raw264.7) and the human monocyte cell line (THP-1). Treatment with STC-1 significantly reduced the expression of inflammation-related genes, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and CCL2. Furthermore, in human hepatic stellate cells (LX-2), fibrosis was induced with TGF-β. STC-1 treatment led to a significant reduction in fibrosis-related genes such as TIMP-1, TGF-β, COL1A1, and ACTA2. In a mouse model of MASH induced by the MCD diet, recombinant STC-1 protein was administered. Liver tissue analysis showed a marked reduction in inflammation and fibrosis.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates that STC-1, which is over- expressed in the intestine following RYGB surgery, is secreted into the portal circulation and delivered to the liver, where it ameliorates MASH. These findings highlight a key mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of RYGB on MASH.

**Background and aims:**
Recent studies have identified CLEC11A as a key regulator enhancing β-cell proliferation and insulin secretion, posi- tioning it as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders‌12. While its role in pancreatic function is well-documented, emerging research focuses on uncovering additional clinical applications of CLEC11A modulation‌12. Notably, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a prevalent complication in type 2 diabetes mel- litus (T2DM) patients, remains a critical unmet medical need due to the absence of therapies capable of reversing hepatic steatosis‌45. This study bridges mechanistic insights with clinical relevance by investigat- ing the correlation between circulating CLEC11A levels and liver fat content, aiming to elucidate its dual role in metabolic regulation and provide actionable strategies for MAFLD treatment‌.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study analyzed the con- centrations of CLEC11A in blood samples from 306 well-characterized individuals. Parameters assessed included anthropometric data, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), glycosylated hemoglobin, and blood lipids. Liver steatosis was quantitatively diagnosed using the FibroScan Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP). Participants were categorized into mild fatty liver (240 ≤ CAP < 265, n = 70), moderate fatty liver (265 ≤ CAP < 295, n = 114), severe fatty liver (CAP ≥ 295, n = 68), and age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy control subjects (CAP < 240, n = 54).

**Results:**
In the final analysis, 54 participants without liver steatoses, 252 were with liver steatosis. Compared with than non-liver steato- sis, liver steatosis group exhibited lower CLEC11A (64.34 ± 24.63 vs. 85.17 ± 31.1, P < 0.01). In people with higher Serum CLEC11A levels, fasting blood sugar, postprandial blood sugar and triglycerides were lower (P < 0.01). Spearman correlation analysis showed a nega- tive correlation between CLEC11A and CAP in the overall population (β: -0.36[-0.48~-0.25], p <0.001). After adjust the confounding fac- tors including HbA1c, serum glucose and lipid, BMI, Waist-to-Hip Ratio, the association remains significant. Besides, Logistic regression showed that CLEC11A is negatively associated with liver steatosis is after multivariate adjustment (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97 - 0.99, p < 0.001)

**Conclusion:**
In this cross-sectional study, the severity of liver stea- tosis was negatively correlated with CLEC11A concentration. These findings suggest that CLEC11A may serve as a diagnostic target for MAFLD.

**Real-world utility of non-invasive fibrosis markers of MASLD: a triage model validated against FibroScan**

K. Gupta

**Background and aims:**
Timely identification of significant fibrosis (≥F2) in MASLD is critical for appropriate referral, especially in real-world primary care settings where access to elastography is often limited. This study evaluated the performance of simple non-invasive markers—FIB-4, NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS), Body Mass Index (BMI), and Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR)—in identifying patients with sig- nificant fibrosis, using FibroScan as the reference.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective observational study included 192 MASLD patients (141 diabetics, 51 non-diabetics) in a real world clinical setting between 2023-2024. All patients were of Indian-Asian ethnicity. Fibrosis staging was based on FibroScan with ≥7.5 kPa defining significant fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS were derived from laboratory and demographic data; BMI and WHR were obtained from clinical measurements. ROC curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of individual markers and a composite triage model using predefined thresholds for FIB-4 and BMI.

**Results:**
FIB-4 and NFS showed moderate performance in detecting ≥F2 fibrosis across both diabetic and non-diabetic groups (AUC range: 0.66-0.70). In non-diabetics, BMI (mean: 34.0 ± 22.8 kg/m²) was a stronger fibrosis discriminator (AUC = 0.65), while in diabetics, WHR (mean: 1.10 ± 0.77) was consistently elevated, suggesting its value in capturing central adiposity-linked risk. A composite triage cutoff of FIB-4 > 1.66 and BMI > 31.2 improved risk stratification in both groups, achieving AUCs of 0.75 in diabetics and 0.72 in non-diabetics. This improvement was statistically significant compared to FIB-4 alone (AUC = 0.66, p = 0.03).

**Conclusion:**
In MASLD patients, especially those with diabetes, a tri- age model combining simple non-invasive metrics such as FIB-4 and BMI provides reliable identification of individuals at risk of significant fibrosis. FIB-4 and NFS alone showed sub-optimal performance in this real-world cohort, whereas the addition of anthropometric markers like BMI and WHR enhanced discrimination for effective risk triage. This low-cost, practical framework supports early hepatology referral and is particularly valuable in resource-constrained settings where FibroScan access may be limited.

**Serum GIP is a potential biomarker for hepatic steatosis/fibrosis in patients with metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease**

Z. Cai

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a prevalent condition in patients with type 2 dia- betes mellitus (T2DM). Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) is mainly synthesized and secreted by K cells and enhances insu- lin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and promotes fat storage. This study aimed to assess the relationship between GIP levels and anthropometric/metabolic parameters, liver stiffness, and hepatic stea- tosis/fibrosis indices in individuals with MAFLD.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 360 subjects were enrolled in this cross-sectional study, including 160 subjects with liver fibrosis and 200 subjects without liver fibrosis by age- and sex-matched. Transientelas- tography (TE-Fibroscan®), anthropometric measurements, metabolic parameters, and GIP levels (ELISA, MLBIO, China) were evaluated.

**Results:**
Among the 360 subjects, 22% were normoglycemic with vary- ing degrees of liver fibrosis, and 22% had T2DM with liver fibrosis. Serum GIP levels were significantly decreased in the fibrosis group than those without fibrosis (373.56±125.12 vs. 437.09±151.66 pg/ ml, P<0.001). GIP levels were significantly correlated with 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2hPG), waist-hip ratio, high density lipoprotein (HDL), creatinine,uric acid, controlled attenuation param- eter (CAP), and liver stiffness (P<0.05). Subjects with GIP above the median values showed significantly lower body weight, waist-hip ratio, alanine transaminase (ALT)-aspartate transaminase (AST) ratio, creati- nine, uric acid and milder liver stiffness compared to those with values below the median (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that serum GIP level was significantly independently correlated with liver steatosis and cirrhosis (P<0.01).

**Conclusion:**
GIP levels are correlated well with anthropometric and metabolic characteristics, representing a good biomarker for early iden- tification of MAFLD.

**Association between uric acid/HDL-C ratio and metabolic dysfunc- tion-associated steatotic liver disease: a retrospective study in type 2 diabetes**

X. Zhu

**Background and aims:**
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at an increased risk of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MAFLD). The uric acid to high-density lipo- protein cholesterol ratio (UHR) is a novel metabolic marker shown to correlate with MAFLD. This study amid to investigate the association of UHR with MASHAD in T2DM patients.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective, single-center study ana- lyzed data from 1081 T2DM patients, including 464 without MAFLD and 617 with MAFLD. Physiological and biochemical parameters were collected and analyzed. The UHR was calculated as [UA (mg/dl)/ HDL-C (mg/dl)] × 100%. Univariate and multivariate logistic regres- sion analysis was performed to examine the association between UHR and MAFLD in this population.This study has been reviewed by the local ethics committee and it has therefore been performed in accord- ance with the ethical standards laid down in the Helsinki Declaration.

**Results:**
UHR was significantly higher in T2DM patients with MAFLD compared to those without MAFLD (12.12[9.06,16.83] vs 10.36[7.65,14.08], <0.001). Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive association between UHR and metabolic parameters, including BMI (r = 0.330, < 0.001), WHR (r = 0.289, < 0.001), HOMA-IR (r = 0.121, = 0.005), TG (r = 0.516, < 0.001), and ALT (r = 0.123, < 0.001). Negative correlations were observed with age (r = -0.168, < 0.001), diabetes duration (r = -0.102, = 0.002), HbA1c (r = -0.067, = 0.030), 2hBG (r = -0.083, = 0.017), and TC (r = -0.120, < 0.001). Binary logistic regression analysis identified UHR as an independent predictor of NAFLD (OR = 1.085, 95% CI: 1.059 - 1.111, < 0.001) in T2DM patients, even after adjusting for age, diabetes duration, BMI, blood pressure, and other biochemical parameters.

**Conclusion:**
The study demonstrates that UHR is an independent pre- dictor of MAFLD in patients with T2DM, suggesting its potential as a valuable clinical marker for early identification of MAFLD in this high- risk population.

4. Netherlands, Diabeter Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

**Background and aims:**
Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a very reactive com- pound which modifies proteins forming advanced glycation end products, and activates inflammatory pathways. Elevated MGO levels have been linked to various diseases, including type 2 diabetes. However, the role of MGO and other glycating agents in the progression of liver fibrosis in the setting of metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is poorly understood.

**Materials and methods:**
This study explores the relationship between plasma MGO levels and related dicarbonyls (glyoxal (GO) and 3-deoxy- glucosone (3-DG)), which are measured using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and liver fibrosis assessed via histological liver biopsy scoring (0 - no fibrosis, 1 - moderate fibrosis, 2 or greater - severe fibrosis) and the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index. The study population comprised 264 severely obese indi- viduals due to undergo bariatric surgery, a subset from the BARIA cohort (22% diabetes; 77% females; median age 47 (IQR: 39-54 years); BMI 39 (IQR: 36-41 kg/m²).

**Results:**
MGO levels were significantly higher in individuals with dia- betes compared to individuals without diabetes with a median of 288 nmol/L (257 - 334 nmol/L) and 238 (212 - 279 nmol/L) respectively. MGO levels were higher in males compared to females with a median of 267 (236 - 301 nmol/L) and 245 (214 - 288 nmol/L) respectively. Similar results were found for GO and 3DG. Higher plasma MGO, GO and 3DG levels were significantly associated with the FIB-4 Index (MGO, rho = 0.23, p< 0.01), (GO, rho = 0.22, p< 0.01), (3DG, rho = 0.15, p< 0.05). MGO and GO were also associated with liver fibrosis scoring from biopsy before and after adjustment for confounders (age, sex, BMI, sub-cohort, smoking status, alcohol consumption, hypertension, HOMA-IR, HbA1c and fasting glucose levels). Notably, the relationships remained significant in individuals without type 2 diabetes and after adjusting for HbA1c and fasting glucose levels. No significant associations were observed between MGO, GO or 3DG and steatosis or inflammation histology scores after adjustment for confounders.

**Conclusion:**
This study shows a potential MGO-driven dicarbonyl stress as an independent contributor to liver fibrosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is reversible early on, but can progress to severe liver morbidities without intervention. Despite improvements in MASLD management, molecular and metabolic changes underpin- ning key transitions driving disease progression in the context of obe- sity remain poorly understood. We aim to uncover potential targets for validation by providing a comprehensive dual-omic resource of the molecular landscape in obese individuals with MASLD.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed transcriptomics on liver and metabolomics on liver and plasma samples from obese individuals with no liver pathology or early-stage MASLD. Experimental validation was conducted using both in vitro and ex vivo systems.

**Results:**
Remodeling of the liver metabolome is primarily driven by parenchymal accumulation of neutral lipids, whereas the plasma metabolome displayed little differences with disease progression. The liver transcriptome signatures of steatosis and fibrosis were distinct. Metabolic remodeling was a feature of steatosis, whereas global gene expression shift was a signature of fibrosis. We identified more than 100 novel genes associated with fibrosis, among them GTPases and their regulators that were a novel signature for fibrosis progression in steatotic liver. GTPase genes and their regulators were associated with hepatic fibrosis grades and co-expressed with TGF-β signaling genes. We further demonstrated involvement of TGF-ß dependent GTPase regulation in fibrogenesis in HSC-like LX-2 cells and 3D liver sphe- roids of primary human hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells.

**Conclusion:**
Our study suggests different molecular features underly- ing steatosis and fibrosis development in obese individuals with early MASLD and highlights the potential to identify targets associated with fibrosis, which will need to be further validated.

2. seok dong 588, Dongu, Gwangju, Republic of Korea, Boeun Hospital,

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a growing concern in individuals with diabe- tes, particularly among postmenopausal females. Although breastfeed- ing is known to provide long-term metabolic benefits, its association with liver fibrosis has not been clearly established. This study aimed to investigate the association between breastfeeding duration and the risk of liver fibrosis, estimated using the FIB-4 index, in postmenopausal females with diabetes or prediabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2021). Among 11,534 postmenopausal females, 2,091 with diabetes and 3,859 with predia- betes were included. Participants were categorized by total breastfeed- ing duration: <9, 9-12, 12.1-18, and >18 months. Liver fibrosis was assessed using the FIB-4 index. Multivariable logistic regression analy- ses were conducted, adjusting for lifestyle behaviors, sociodemographic factors, established MASLD risk factors, and reproductive history.

**Results:**
After full adjustment for sociodemographic variables (fam- ily income, region, and education), lifestyle factors (smoking status, physical activity, and total energy intake), and reproductive factors (age at menarche, age at menopause, number of pregnancies, and age at first and last childbirth), breastfeeding durations of <9 months and 9-12 months were associated with a higher risk of FIB-4-estimated liver fibrosis compared with durations >18 months (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.729; 95% CI, 1.099-2.719, and OR 1.595; 95% CI, 1.176-2.164, respectively). A shorter breastfeeding duration was associated with an increasing risk of liver fibrosis (P for trend <0.05). In subgroup analyses among individuals with diabetes, the association was consist- ent across key clinical subgroups. Among those with prediabetes, no significant association was observed after full adjustment.

**Conclusion:**
In postmenopausal females with diabetes, shorter breast- feeding duration—particularly less than 12 months—was associated with an increased risk of liver fibrosis related to MASLD. These find- ings suggest a potential protective role of longer breastfeeding in reduc- ing liver fibrosis risk in this population.

**Bioimpedance analysis and cardiovascular testing as predictors of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients type 2 diabetes**

I. Gurieva

**Background and aims:**
to study the mechanisms of the relationship between body composition, NAFLD and cardiovascular testing in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus

**Materials and methods:**
in this cross-sectional study 94 patients with T2DM (m:f=14:80) aged 63 [59;68] years (Me [Q1; Q3]), disease duration 12,1 ± 7,7 years and 27 persons without diabe- tes (DM-) (60±7 years) were examined. A complex of clinical and instrumental examinations was performed: bioimpedance analysis, liver transient elastometry (TE), cardiovascular testing (CARTs with assessment of heart rate variability (HRV)) were performed. Autonomic neuropathy (AN) was defined as the pathological value of at least one CARTs. Hepatic steatosis was confirmed when the ultrasound attenuation parameter (UAP) level exceeded 243 dB/m. Hepatic fibrosis was confirmed when liver stiffness measurement (LSM) level exceeded 7.3 kPa.

**Results:**
steatosis was detected in 94 (100%) patients with T2DM, AN - in 90 (95,7%) patients in the DM+ group, steatosis was detected in 8 (29,6%) people and AN in 6 (22,2%) in DM- group. When analyzing the general group (121 people), depending on the presence or absence of AN, differences were revealed between UAP (dB/m) 318 [292; 335] versus 238 [226;264](p<0,001), HbA1c levels (%) 7.0 [6.1;7.8] vs. 5.2 [5.1;5.4] (p<0,001); bioimpedance indicators - visceral fat area ­(cm ) 318 [335.2; 292.0] versus 238 [226; 264](p < 0,001), body fat mass (kg) 39.6 [34;48] versus 19.2 [13;29] (p< 0,001), percentage of body fat mass (%) 44.3 [39.7;50.2] versus 26.5 [21.2;36.5] (p < 0,001). A correlation analysis conducted in a general group of patients revealed a moderate relationship between the TE index (UAP) and heart rate variation in test with deep breathing r=-0.4 (p<0.01), as well as HbA1c levels; weak inverse relationship between TE index (LSM) and Valsalva test r=-0,3 (p< 0,001). Positive correlations between liver fibrosis indi- cator (LSM) and amount of liver fat (UAP) (r=0,3, p < 0,001), visceral fat area (VFA) (r=0.3, p=0.001) were revealed. Visceral fat area meas- ured with bioimpedance analysis can be considered as a predictor of clinically significant liver fibrosis (≥ F2) (OR = 1,009 (1,002 - 1,015)) (p = 0,008). Amount of liver fat (UAP) (OR = 1,027 (1,002 - 1,052)(p = 0,036)) and body fat mass (OR = 1,012 (1,003 - 1,021)(p = 0,007)) can be predictors of the presence of clinically significant liver fibrosis (≥ F2) by TE.

**Conclusion:**
The influence of dysfunction of AN, diagnosed by CARTs on fatty infiltration of liver determined by TE in type 2 diabetes mel- litus was found. The development of NAFLD and obesity may be influenced by impaired autonomic nerves control and correlates with cardiac autonomic failure.

**Real-world observational study on GLP-1RA and SGLT2i effect on liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and the impact of GLP-1R polymorphisms**

V. Velardi, Bonato, G. Fusaro, B. Fabris, S. Bernardi

**Background and aims:**
More than 65% of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is a risk factor not only for liver failure but also for cardiovascular disease. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibi- tors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP- 1RA) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing transaminases, hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of GLP-1RA and SGLT2i on MASLD in T2DM patients and at evaluat- ing the impact of polymorphisms (rs761387 and rs6923761) on the response to GLP-1RA and SGLT2i.

**Materials and methods:**
Retrospective observational study enrolling patients with T2DM and liver steatosis. Inclusion criteria: (1) consent to participate; (2) 1-year of therapy with GLP-1RA or SGLT2i; (3) age > 18 years; (4) T2DM; (5) history/ultrasound evidence of liver steatosis or transaminase increase. After 1-year from the start of the therapy we collected baseline and 1-year clinical and laboratory data and we performed an abdominal ultrasound with elastography as well as genotyping analyses.

**Results:**
Patients on GLP-1RA were younger than those on SGLT2i (p < 0.0001), and more frequently female (p = 0.004). Baseline BMI (p < 0.001) and HbA1c (p = 0.01) were higher in the GLP-1RA group. Chronic kidney disease was more frequent in the SGLT2i group (p = 0.001). Most patients had liver stiffness <5 kPa, corresponding to an early stage of liver disease. BMI but not HbA1c correlated signifi- cantly with the Hamaguchi score, an indicator of MASLD severity (p < 0.0001). Polymorphism rs761387 of GLP-1R was associated with poorer glycemic control at baseline (p = 0.036). Both GLP-1RA and SGLT2i led to a significant reduction in BMI and HbA1c (all p < 0.001). In patients with baseline transaminase >35 U/L, both GLP- 1RA and SGLT2i significantly lowered aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. (GLP-1RA: AST p = 0.021, ALT p = 0.004; SGLT2i: AST p = 0.012, ALT p = 0.003). However, in patients displaying hepatic steatosis after 1-year of treatment, only GLP-1RA significantly reduced transaminases. Regarding GLP-1R polymorphisms, rs6923761 polymorphism did not modify the response to the therapy. By contrast, rs761387 polymorphism was associated with no response to the therapy in terms of transaminase decrease.

**Conclusion:**
Our real-world data show that both GLP-1RA and SGLT2i effectively reduce BMI, HbA1c, as well as AST, and ALT, making them promising therapies for patients with T2DM and MASLD. GLP- 1RA seem to be more effective than SGLT2i. Only GLP-1R rs761387 polymoprhism seems to modify the response. Further studies are needed not onto confirm but also to extend these findings.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is rising constantly in proportion to the global increase in obesity and metabolic syndrome with a prevalence of 25-30%. Patients with MASH with fibrosis stage ≥F2 present a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. The gold standard for the diagnosis of MASLD, especially MASH, remains liver biopsy. However, non- invasive tests for liver fibrosis assessment are becoming more widely used in clinical practice.The aim of the study was to analyze clinical, biochemical and imaging studies in patients with MASLD confirmed by liver biopsy and to compare non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis.

**Materials and methods:**
The study included 80 patients (25 females, 55 males) with MASLD confirmed in liver biopsy. The retrospective analysis of medical history, laboratory, imaging tests and liver biopsy was performed distinguishing patients according to the stage of fibro- sis in the liver biopsy (F0-F1 and ≥F2). The most common markers of liver fibrosis were assessed and compared with the results of liver biopsy. The ROC curves were drawn for each non-invasive test of liver fibrosis and new cutoff points in the diagnosis of significant fibrosis using the Youden index were determined.

**Results:**
Significant fibrosis (≥F2) was found in 32 patients and non-significant fibrosis (<F2) in 48 patients. The group of patients with ≥F2 fibrosis had higher BMI (p=0,017), lower total (p=0,019), non-HDL cholesterol (p=0,029) and triglycerides (p=0,022) and higher AST (p=0,02). The group with ≥F2 fibrosis was more likely to present with hypertension (p=0,03), type 2 diabetes (p<0,001), obesity (p=0,04) and metabolic syndrome (p=0,05). The percent- age of steatosis in the liver biopsy correlated with body weight (R=0,254, p=0,023), BMI (R=0,279, p=0,012), leukocyte count (R=0,251, p=0,024), ALT (R=0,337, p=0,002) and AST (R=0,373, p=0,001) activity, controlled attenuation parameter in Fibros- can (R=0,415, p=0,014), fasting insulin concentration (R=0,447, p=0,017), HOMA-IR (R=0,411, p=0,033) and inversely correlated with QUICKI (R=-0,411, p=0,033). There was a positive correlation between the lobular inflammation and AST (R=0,275, p=0,013) and the fibrosis stage and AST (R=0,272, p=0,015). All non-invasive methods for assessing liver fibrosis positively correlated with the fibrosis stage in the liver biopsy (p<0,001). The largest area under the ROC curve was obtained for Fibroscan (AUROC=0,832), while tests including biochemical parameters showed similar diagnostic accuracy. The combination of tests presented an increase in their diagnostic accuracy. The new optimal cutoff points of each non- invasive test based on the Youden index in order to identify patients with ≥F2 fibrosis were lower than those previously presented in the literature, which was associated with an increase in their sensitivity and negative predictive value.

**Conclusion:**
Non-invasive diagnostic methods for liver fibrosis appear to be useful in assessing fibrosis stage. They become particularly important with the appearance of the treatment. While using non- invasive tests to diagnose F2-F4 liver fibrosis, a lower cut-off points or using two methods simultaneously in patients with MASLD should be considered.

**Background and aims:**
People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) face a sig- nificant burden of excess cardiovascular risk, which is further amplified by metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and hepatic fibrosis. This study aimed to explore the correlation between non-invasive measures of MASLD and hepatic fibrosis with predicted cardiovascular risk in individuals with T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
In hospital-based diabetes clinics in Swansea (UK), participants with T2D underwent additional liver assessments, including blood tests and Fibroscan. Predicted cardiovascular risk was calculated using the QRISK-3 calculator. Spearman’s rank correla- tion and linear regression analysis were used to evaluate associations between non-invasive measures of hepatic fibrosis, steatosis, and car- diovascular risk.

**Results:**
Two hundred participants (mean age: 59.4 ± 11.0 years, 42.0% female) were included. Based on Fibroscan criteria, 63.0% had moderate-to-severe hepatic steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter ≥302 dB/m), and 23.0% had advanced fibrosis (liver stiffness measure ≥9.7 kPa). Significant correlations were observed between predicted cardiovascular risk and the AST:ALT ratio (p < 0.01), enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test (p < 0.01), fibrosis-4 score (p < 0.01), and non- alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS) (p < 0.01), but not with Fibroscan-liver stiffness measure. Higher cardiovascular risk was seen in individuals with a high risk of advanced fibrosis compared to intermediate or low risk using the AST:ALT ratio (p < 0.05), ELF test (p< 0.001), fibrosis-4 score (p< 0.001), and NFS (p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis revealed statistically significant relationships only for the ELF test (p < 0.001) and NFS (p < 0.05). Measures of hepatic steatosis, including hepatic steatosis index, triglyceride-glucose index, and Fibroscan-controlled attenuation parameter, did not correlate with QRISK-3. Observations were consistent across individuals with and without MASLD based on Fibroscan criteria.

**Conclusion:**
The ELF test demonstrated a significant correlation with QRISK-3 in people with T2D, suggesting its utility in identifying not only unrecognized hepatic fibrosis but also cardiovascular risk. Early detection supports targeted cardiovascular risk factor and liver-related management. This study highlights a potentially novel clinical applica- tion of the ELF test in routine practice for people with T2D, warranting further evaluation.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes and obesity may affect the response to hypoglycemia. This study aimed to investigate the different responses of the pituitary-adrenal axis to hypoglycemia at the onset of different types of diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We enrolled newly diagnosed and drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or type 1 diabetes (T1DM), and controls without diabetes. All the patients with diabetes were treated with an insulin pump until blood glucose was normalized. Then hyper- insulinemic euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamps were performed on all participants. We measured hormones of the pituitary-adrenal axis dur- ing the clamps.

**Results:**
During hypoglycemic clamps, CP, TSH, E and T decreased, while prolactin, ACTH, cortisol and GH increased significantly (p all <0.05) according to ANOVA for repeated measures. Moreover, these three groups had different CP, ACTH, cortisol, GH, E, and T responses to hypoglycemia (p all <0.05) . The GH levels significantly increased at the 30th minute of hypoglycemia in the T2DM group and normal controls, while significantly increased 10 min after hypoglycemia in the T1DM group. Therefore, GH levels in the T1DM group were significantly higher than in the normal group from euglycemia to 20 min after hypoglycemia (p all <0.05). ACTH and cortisol levels increased fastest and highest in the T2DM group. The cortisol levels throughout the whole hypoglycemia period were higher in the T2DM group than those in the normal group (p all <0.05). In the non-diabetes group, the T level significantly decreased at 0 min of hypoglycemia (p<0.001) and maintained at the lower level during hypoglycemia compared with that during euglycemia. However, the changes in T levels were not significant in the groups with diabetes (p all >0.05). In the non-diabetes group and T2DM group, the E level at 10 min of hypoglycemia was lower than that at 0 min. E levels significantly increased in the T2DM group than in the T1DM group and non-diabetes controls.

**Conclusion:**
Patients have different GH and sex hormone responses to hypoglycemia with different types of diabetes, and individualized hypo- glycemic management may be required.

**Background and aims:**
Serotonin, a bioamine synthesized from tryptophan mainly in the gut, has been reported to modulate lipid and glucose metabolism. In mice, circulating serotonin increases endogenous glucose production (EGP). However, this phenomenon has not been examined in humans, and particularly those with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We assessed the relationships between EGP with serum serotonin and glucoregulatory hormones after an oral glucose load in T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
25 participants with T2D managed by metformin monotherapy (18M/7F, 67.1±1.2 years, BMI 32±1.5kg/ m , HbA1c 7.0±0.1%, none on medications affecting serotonin lev- els) were evaluated. After an overnight fast, participants received an IV bolus infusion of 6,6-[ H ]glucose (28μmol/kg) at t=-180min, followed by a continuous IV infusion at 0.28 μmol/kg/min at t=- 180-240min), and a 75g glucose drink containing 1.5g [U- C] glucose at t=-5-0min. Venous blood was sampled to measure blood glucose (glucometer), plasma insulin (ELISA), glucagon (radioim- munoassay) and EGP (glucose tracers determined by gas chroma- tography-mass spectrometry), with areas under the curves 0-240min (AUC​ ) calculated. Fasting serum serotonin was measured by ELISA. The relationship between EGP AUC​ with serotonin was assessed by linear regression analysis, adjusted for HbA1c, gender and BMI. Participants were also stratified into ‘low’ (≤10 ng/mL N=15) or ‘high’ (>10 ng/mL, N=10) serotonin subgroups, with insulin, glucagon and EGP responses to oral glucose compared by two-way ANOVA. Data are means ± SEM. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
After the glucose drink, EGP decreased rapidly to a nadir at t=30min, followed by a progressive increase to a peak at t=150min. EGP AUC​ was related directly to the fasting serotonin con- centration ­(R =0.26, P=0.004). Subgroup analysis showed that, in participants with ‘high’ serotonin, EGP was greater (Group×Time: P=0.0003) and glucagon suppression was less (Group×Time: P=0.029) after oral glucose, although blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were comparable (P>0.05 each).

**Conclusion:**
In people with T2D, EGP after an oral glucose load is related to fasting serum serotonin, which may reflect impaired glucagon suppression. These observations support further investi- gation into the relevance of serotonin to the regulation of glucose metabolism in both health and T2D.

**Background and aims:**
In people with or without type 1 diabetes, a single experimental hypoglycaemic event induces an acute and pro- longed pro-inflammatory response. Acutely, this response is char- acterized by a change in immune cell subsets, increased proportion of non-classical (CD16+) monocytes and cytotoxic (CD8+) T-cells, and decreased proportion of classical (CD14+) monocytes and helper (CD4+) T-cells. In addition, stimulation of monocytes shows increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL- 1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) during hypoglycaemia, which normalizes after 1 day. To determine whether adrenaline drives this pro-inflammatory response, we investigated the acute and prolonged effects of adrenaline, at concentrations seen during hypoglycaemia, on immune cell subsets and cytokine production in monocytes.

**Materials and methods:**
People with type 1 diabetes (n=15) and matched people without diabetes (n=15) received intravenous adrena- line at 0.04 μg/kg/min for 1 hour. Blood was drawn before adrenaline administration (baseline), and 30 minutes, 60, 180 minutes, 1, 3 and 7 day(s) after start of adrenaline. Immune cell subsets in whole blood were assessed using flow cytometry. Monocytes were isolated using indirect magnetic labeling and stimulated with 10 ug/mL of Pam3Cys (P3C) or 10 ng/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from for 24 hours. Cytokine production of IL-1β, TNF-α was quanti- fied by ELISA. Serial data were analyzed with a mixed model analysis.

**Results:**
Plasma adrenaline levels peaked to 2.37±0.28 and 2.23±0.25 nmol/L in people with and without T1D, respectively (p=NS). Adrena- line significantly increased the proportion of non-classical (CD16+) monocytes and cytotoxic (CD8+) T-cells and decreased the proportion of classical (CD14+) monocytes and helper (CD4+) T-cells after 30 and 60 minutes in both groups (p<0.001). After 180 minutes, an oppos- ing effect was observed, with decreased proportions of non-classical monocytes (CD16+) and cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+) and increased pro- portions of classical monocytes (CD14+) and helper T-cells (CD4+), compared to baseline values in both groups (p<0.01). No significant changes regarding these immune cell subsets were observed during subsequent days. Adrenaline infusion significantly increased IL-1β and TNF-α production of monocytes upon LPS stimulation after 30 and 60 minutes in both groups (p<0.05). Similar trends were seen when monocytes were stimulated with P3C, although to a lesser extent compared to LPS stimulation. For both stimulations, IL-1β and TNF-α production of monocytes normalized after 1 day.

**Conclusion:**
Adrenaline at levels observed during hypoglycaemia acutely shifts monocyte and T-cell subsets and cytokine pro- duction by monocytes towards a proinflammatory profile, resembling results from previous hypoglycaemic clamp studies. These findings suggest that adrenaline plays a key role in modifying immune cell subsets and monocyte function observed during hypoglycaemia.

**Differences between men and women in neuroendocrine responses to hypo- and hyperglycaemia; impact for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes development?**

**Background and aims:**
Men and postmenopausal women have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to premenopausal women. Previous research supports a role of the brain in the develop- ment of T2D via peripheral effects of counter-regulatory hormones and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Hypoglycemic responses of these effector pathways have been found to be elevated in healthy men compared to premenopausal women. This study aims to investi- gate if these sex differences also apply to a broad range of metabolic phenotypes - lean, overweight or T2D - and to evaluate the role of menopause and sex hormones in relation to glucose-dependent neu- rohormonal responses.

**Materials and methods:**
50 individuals, 22 men (7 T2D, median age 52 years, BMI 28.8 kg/m ) and 28 women (9 T2D, 16 postmen- opausal, age 51 years, BMI 31.5 kg/m2) underwent one stepwise hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic-hypoglycemic (nadir glucose 2.7 mol/l) and one stepwise hyperglycemic clamp (peak glucose +9 mol/l above fasting level) with repeated measures of counter-regulatory hormones and assessment of heart rate variability. Fasting plasma samples (approx. 9 AM) were used to assess sex hormones (e.g. FSH, LH, estradiol, testosterone).

**Results:**
Men vs women had higher fasting levels of glucagon and ACTH and numerically higher hypoglycemic responses of all counter- regulatory hormones, which was significant (p<0.05) for the AUC of glucagon, cortisol and ACTH and the ΔAUC (subtracting the area under baseline) of glucagon and growth hormone (GH). By contrast, the increase of heart rate and LF:HF (reflecting sympathetic dominance of the ANS) as well as the reduction of HF (reflecting parasympathetic activity) was attenuated in men vs women (all p<0.05). During hyper- glycemia, men had higher AUC of ACTH and mean LF:HF and lower AUC of GH (all p<0.05). Post- vs premenopausal women had lower AUC of GH and mean HF in both clamps and higher mean LF:HF in the hyperglycemic clamp (all p<0.05). Within-sex correlations between neurohormonal responses and sex hormones were generally weak, did not mirror the observed sex differences and overall, sex hormones did not substantially modify the impact of sex in multilinear regression models. By contrast, M-value was the strongest predictor of the AUC of cortisol (std β -0.41) and ACTH (std β -0.33) as well as the increase of heart rate (std β 0.43) during hypoglycemia, whereas waist-hip ratio was the strongest predictor of the ΔAUC of ACTH (std β 0.43) and GH (std β 0.62) during hypoglycemia (p<0.05 for all β) in multilinear regression models including age, sex, fasting glucose, waist-hip ratio and M-value as independent variables. Nevertheless, sex was still sig- nificantly (p<0.05) associated with the AUC of glucagon (std β 0.32, ref. women) and cortisol (std β 0.37) as well as the attenuated lowering of HF (std β 0.42) during hypoglycemia and the AUC of GH (std β -0.32) as well as the mean LF:HF (std β 0.39) during hyperglycemia, in these models.

**Conclusion:**
Hypersecretion of insulin-antagonistic hormones and more marked sympathetic dominance of the ANS in men and post- menopausal women at various glucose levels may potentially drive insulin resistance and contribute to the increased risk of T2D in these groups. Sex-specific metabolic phenotypes, such as central adiposity, but not sex hormone profiles seem to partially explain the observed differences.

**Background and aims:**
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic disease associated with abnormal function of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, resulting in thick mucosal secretions that compromise lung and pancreatic function. The pathol- ogy of the latter affects both the exocrine pancreas, referred to as Pan- creatic Insufficiency (CF-PI), and the endocrine pancreas, which can result in cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) and increased mor- bidity. Impaired blood glucose homeostasis in CF has been ascribed to diminished β-cell mass; however, it remains unclear if there are additional contributors to diminished insulin (INS) secretion in patients with CF. Somatostatin (SRIF) is an islet hormone that inhibits the secretion of other pancreatic hormones, such as INS, but the possibil- ity that it is elevated in CF and that this could impair blood glucose homeostasis has not yet been investigated. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine SRIF levels prior to and in response to a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) in patients with CF.

**Materials and methods:**
Subjects included six healthy controls (HC), ten patients with CF-PI and four patients with CFRD. After an over- night fast, subjects underwent a three-hour MMTT, during which a standardized quantity of Nestle Boost Plus (5 mL/kg body weight) was ingested. Plasma samples for measurement of glucose (PG), INS, C-peptide and SRIF were taken every 10-30 minutes and assayed using commercially available kits.

**Results:**
Prior to the MMTT, PG was similar in CF-PI and HC sub- jects (5.3±0.1 and 5.3±0.2 mmol/L, respectively), as was INS (38±5 and 54±9 pmol/L, respectively; p=0.18), whereas C-peptide was lower (0.38±0.04 and 0.53±0.05 nmol/L in CF-PI and HC, respectively; p=0.06) and SRIF was 63% higher (14.2±1.1 and 8.7±0.5 pmol/L, respectively; p<0.01). In response to the MMTT, the PG area under the curve (AUC) was similar in CF-PI and HC (1.24±0.04 and 1.14±0.06 mol/L*180 min, respectively). However, the C-peptide response, which marks insulin secretion, was diminished in CF-PI versus HC (Δ AUC 133±13 and 240±48 nmol/L*180 in CF-PI and HC, respec- tively; p=0.01) and accompanied by 70% higher SRIF levels (AUC of 2.8±0.2 and 1.9±0.1 nmol/L*180min, respectively; p<0.01). In CFRD, PG prior to the MMTT was higher than that seen in HC (7.9±0.8 and 5.3±0.2 mmol/L, respectively; p<0.01), even in the presence of higher INS levels (88±16 versus 54±9 pmol/L; p=0.03), while SRIF levels were nearly two-fold higher (16.9±3.3 versus 8.7±0.5 pmol/L; p=0.01). In response to the MMTT, the AUC for PG was higher in CFRD compared to HC (1.96±0.25 and 1.14±0.06 mol/L*180 min, respectively; p<0.01), which was accompanied by a 65% decrease in insulin secretion (Δ AUC for C-peptide of 84±15 and 240±48 nmol/L*180 in CFRD and HC, respectively; p=0.01) and elevated SRIF (AUC of 3.2±0.5 and 1.9±0.1 nmol/L*180min, respectively; p<0.01).

**Conclusion:**
These data demonstrate that, in patients with CF-PI and CFRD, aberrant insulin secretion under fasting conditions and in response to a mixed meal tolerance test is associated with a marked (~70%) increase in plasma somatostatin levels. Given somatostatin’s ability to inhibit the secretion of insulin and other hormones, its chronic elevation could be a key contributor to impaired blood glucose homeo- stasis in people with CF and make it a target for novel therapeutic interventions.

**Unravelling the gut microbiota regulation of enteroendocrine cell: implications for energy metabolism**

**Background and aims:**
The incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP are produced by rare intestinal epithelial cells, the enteroendocrine cells (EECs). EECs have a sentinel role being scattered along the intes- tinal tract to secrete hormones for local and systemic functions in response to changes in their environment like food intake or micro- biota activity. Incretin functions are dysregulated in type 2 diabetes, and the gut microbiota has been shown to modulate EEC functions such as evidenced by the high GLP-1 circulating levels in germ-free or antibiotic treated animals. Our main objective is to understand how the gut microbiota regulates EEC functions, and can be used to modulate incretins.

**Materials and methods:**
To achieve this, we depleted gut microbiota using broad-spectrum antibiotics and analysed EECs from C57BL/6 mice genetically modified to produce a fluorescent protein specifi- cally in EECs. We performed transcriptomic analysis of sorted EECs and measured peptide hormone production by mass spectrometry in different intestinal regions. The study was completed by single-cell resolution enzymatic activity assays on histological sections. Differ- ences between groups were assessed using Wilcoxon tests.

**Results:**
Results demonstrate that the absence of gut microbiota leads to region-specific alterations in the expression of gut hormones. Specifically, the expression of , coding for GLP-1 prohormone, increased in the caecum (L2FC = 1.68, padj = 9.1·10 , n = 10) but decreased in the proximal colon (L2FC = 0.59, padj = 4.6·10 , n = 10) while the expression of Gip decreased in the upper intes- tine (ileum : L2FC = -0.61, padj = 8.7·10 , n = 10). In addition to changes in gene expression of gut hormones within EECs, metabolic pathways assessed by KEGG pathway analysis were among the most altered pathways, notably increasing oxidative phosphorylation path- way expression in the absence of microbiota (caecum: size effect = 6.11, p-value = 2.6·10 , n = 3) suggesting that the gut microbiota alters the energy metabolism of these cells. To confirm this altera- tion in EEC metabolism by the gut microbiota, we measured the activity of key metabolic enzymes highlighting differences in metabolic activity between EECs and neighboring epithelial cells (colonic G6PDH activity: foldchange = 6.87, p-value = 9.1·10 , counted cells ≥ 60) and an impact of gut microbiota depletion on this effect (foldchange = 0.82, p-value = 3.7·10 ). We validated the importance of the metabolic activity on gut hormone expression in organoid intestinal models. Oxidative respiration inhibition by oligo- mycin resulted in downregulation (foldchange = 0.14, p-value = 3·10 ).

**Conclusion:**
These observations suggest that the gut microbiota is a major regulator of EEC functions by impacting their metabolism. Different EEC responses were identified along the intestinal tract, thereby opening new avenues for modulating incretin production targeting EECs.

3. gium, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.

**Background and aims:**
Hormonal shifts during menopause (increased FSH and LH and decreased estradiol and progesterone levels) con- tribute to increased fat mass, reduced fat-free mass, and diminished insulin sensitivity (IS). While combined aerobic and strength exercises effectively improve body composition and IS, their impact may be lim- ited in a suboptimal hormonal environment. Therefor, the aim of this study was to compare the effect of a combination of hormone replace- ment therapy and combined aerobic and strength exercise (HRT+Ex) to exercise therapy (Ex) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) alone on insulin sensitivity.

**Materials and methods:**
32 postmenopausal women (0-10 years postmenopausal) were randomly assigned to HRT + EX (n=10), EX (n=12), or HRT (n=10). Measurements included weight, height, BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, fat-free mass (via bio-impedance), fast- ing glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR at baseline and after 12 weeks. The exercise program combined endurance and strength training, performed 3 times per week. Hormone replacement therapy involved estrogen replacement transdermally (1.53 mg/dose, administered twice daily in the morning). HOMA-IR was calculated via (glucose (mg/dl) * insulin (pmol/l)/6)/405.

**Results:**
Baseline parameters were well matched. Following the 12-week intervention, there was no significant change over time in BMI (overall change 28+/-4.9 to 28+/-5.2 kg/m ) and waist circumfer- ence (overall change 95+/-13.1 to 94+/-11.3 cm) and this was similar across the groups. Fat mass significantly decreased (35+/-6.2 to 34+/- 6.0%, p=0.028) and fat free mass increased (63+/-7.6% to 65+/-6.8%, p<0.01) after 12 weeks, but this was not significantly different between the three groups. We observed no significant change in glucose levels (HRT: 93+/-7.4 pre vs 90+/-5.5 post; EX: 87+/-6.3 pre vs 89+/-7.1 post; EX+HRT: 92+/-6.8 pre vs 90+/-6.8 post (mg/dl)), a significant decrease of insulin levels (p<0.05; HRT: 50+/-25.7 pre vs 40+/-20.8 post; EX: 57+/-47.7 pre vs 34+/-9.4 post; EX+HRT: 48+/-21.4 pre vs 27+/-8.1 post (pmol/l)), and an increase in insulin sensitivity over time (p<0.01; HRT: 1.9+/-1.17 pre vs 1.5+/-0.86 post; EX: 2.0+/-1.56 pre vs 1.2+/-0.35 post; EX+HRT: 1.8+/-0.85 pre vs 1.0+/-0.29 post). No significant differences could be shown between the three groups, however a tendency towards HRT (Ex vs HRT: p=0.093; EX+HRT vs HRT: p=0.081) was shown.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass) improved equally with HRT alone, exercise alone, or the com- bination of both. However, insulin sensitivity declined significantly in all three groups, with a trend favoring EX and EX+HRT towards HRT alone.

**Skeletal muscle ablation of Pik3c2b improves insulin sensitivity and body weight regulation**

S. Han, E. ­Pannia, R. ­Simonian, N. ­Sabha, J. ­Beaudry, S. ­Harper, J.J. ­Dowling

**Background and aims:**
Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) regulate key cellular functions, including lipid membrane trafficking, nutrient signaling, and metabolic homeostasis. While the functions of Class I and III PI3Ks have been extensively studied, Class II PI3Ks are much less well characterized. PIK3C2B, a Class II PI3K, is emerging as an important modifier of muscle function and systemic energy metabo- lism. This study investigated how ablation of modulates insu- lin sensitivity and whole-body energy homeostasis and explores how skeletal muscle directed knockdown via a novel gene therapy may be therapeutically leveraged for the treatment of insulin resistance and related co-morbidities.

**Materials and methods:**
An ACTA1 Cre-lox system was used to excise Pik3c2b in the skeletal muscle of male mice that were fed standard Chow diet throughout adulthood up to 40 weeks old. Body weight, food intake and MRI analyses were assessed weekly, as well as energy expenditure analyses and in vivo intraperitoneal (IP) insulin tolerance testing. Histopathological analyses in liver, visceral adipose and skeletal muscle were performed, alongside a GLUT4 translocation assay on ex vivo insulin stimulated skeletal muscle. For genetic therapy treatments, a MYOAAV3A delivery system encapsulating a Pik3c2b specific synthetic miRNA, or PBS control, was intravenously deliv- ered to male WT mice at 23 days and metabolic phenotypic conducted throughout adulthood.

**Results:**
Pik3c2b KO mice exhibited delayed age-related weight gain (30%, p<0.05), greater lean mass, lower fat mat and increased locomo- tor activity without changes in food intake. Hepatic lipid accumula- tion and adiposity in both subcutaneous and visceral fat depots in KO mice were also significantly reduced, with KO mice further exhibit- ing smaller adipocyte size. Pik3c2b KO mice also had enhanced insulin sensitivity (66% higher AUC at 30 min, p<0.05) that asso- ciated with greater insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the sarcolemma in skeletal muscle.Pik3c2b genetic targeting in WT mice via MYOAAV-miRNA successfully reduced Pik3c2b on both the transcriptional and protein level specifically within skeletal muscle compared to that of PBS controls (p<0.05). miRNA treated mice fur- ther exhibited lower body weight and total fat mass throughout adult- hood (p<0.05), without differences in cumulative food intake. Data on locomotor activity, and insulin related analyses are currently ongoing.

**Conclusion:**
Pik3c2b ablation improves body weight gain and insulin sensitivity throughout adulthood, indicating a novel and important role of Pik3c2b in skeletal muscle dependent energy homeostasis. Genetic therapies that downregulate PIK3C2B may be leveraged for the treat- ment of adverse metabolic factors contributing to insulin resistance and related co-morbidities.

**Background and aims:**
Sedentary work environments are associated with metabolic risks. This pilot study investigated the physiological and psychological effects of introducing standing desks in a sedentary office setting.

**Materials and methods:**
A one-month interventional study was conducted with 10 healthy office workers (7 women, age 36.5 ± 1.86 years). Participants were provided adjustable standing desks and instructed to stand at will. Assessments included calorie expenditure, steps/24 hours, distance traveled/24 hours, heart rate, continuous glu- cose monitoring, carbohydrate utilization (assessed by morning, fasting exhaled CO2 measurements), body composition analysis, comprehen- sive physiological measurements and workplace well-being question- naires (questionnaires were administered to the participants, a matching control group and their supervisors).

**Results:**
Participants stood at their desks for an average of 273 ± 70 minutes per workday. During the standing desk intervention, partici- pants demonstrated a slight increase in daily physical activity with 8.5% more steps/day (7926 ± 2658 vs. 7304 ± 2752, p=0.19) and 10.9% greater distance (6582 ± 2296 vs. 5936 ± 2334, p= 0.14) while maintaining similar caloric expenditure (2087 ± 413 vs. 2098 ± 407, p=0.41 ) and exhibiting a reduced mean 24-hour heart rate (73 ± 3 vs. 76 ± 2 bpm, p= 0.02). This was accompanied by an improvement in the 30-second chair stand test (27.6 ± 2.6 vs. 20.6 ± 5.4 repetitions, p=0.006) with no change in maximum leg extension strength. Body weight increased from 65.6 to 68.4 kg (p<0.001), primarily due to increased body fat percentage (+1.76%; p=0.049) with no change in muscle mass. Total caloric consumption was slightly higher (1780±220 kcal vs. 2375±222 kcal, p=0.13) with a trend towards increased con- sumption of all macronutrients. Fasting carbohydrate utilization was unchanged (Lumen score 4.51 ± 0.28 vs 4.54 ±0.25, p=0.20) while 24-hour glucose increased from 88.5 to 93 mg/dL (p=0.013). Work- place assessment of well-being at work questionnaires filled by the study participants and matching control subjects suggested an over- all improvement in workplace satisfaction, higher energy levels and a reduction in work-related stress. Employee performance metrics as assessed by supervisors, were generally high and did not change dur- ing the intervention while productivity was assessed as reduced in 1 participant and increased in 4 participants.

**Conclusion:**
Standing desks significantly improved workplace well- being while yielding mixed physiological outcomes. Despite increased standing time, participants showed minimal changes in activity metrics and unexpectedly gained weight from increased body fat. The inter- vention positively impacted perceived energy, stress reduction, and functional performance, but was associated with higher 24-hour glu- cose levels. The most consistent benefits were psychological rather than metabolic, suggesting that standing desks primarily enhance per- ceived well-being rather than directly improving metabolic parameters in healthy office workers.

4. University, Sapporo, Japan, Department of Pharmacology, Sapporo
5. Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan, Department

**Background and aims:**
We recently showed that AMP deaminase 3 (AMPD3), a rate-limiting enzyme of adenine nucleotide catabolism, is upregulated in the myocardium of obese diabetic model rats. Although AMPD3 has also been reported to be upregulated in atrophied skeletal muscles, the role of AMPD3 in diabetes-induced sarcopenia remains unclear.

**Materials and methods:**
Twelve-week-old C57BL/6J mice with wild- type (WT) or AMPD3 global knockout (KO) were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (STZ, 150mg/kg) to induce diabetes or vehicle as control. Physical performance was assessed by a treadmill test 11 days after injection. Isometric contractile properties of plantar flexor muscles were assessed by torque measurement 12 days after injection. Mice were euthanized for organ harvest as needed, and the samples were subjected to biochemical assays and metabolome analysis.

**Results:**
Hyperglycemia (≥200 mg/dL) was observed 3 days after STZ injection in all mice. The treadmill test revealed that running distance was reduced by STZ, with a greater reduction in KO mice (232 ± 15 m) compared to WT mice (364 ± 26 m, p<0.05). Similarly, the reduction of muscle torque by STZ was greater in KO mice (24%) than that in WT mice (18%, p<0.05). While muscle mass reduction was observed only in gastrocnemius in WT mice, extensive reductions in fast-twitch dominant lower limb muscles such as gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and plantaris were observed in KO mice (p<0.05). In contrast, the vehicle-treated mice showed no differences in running distance, muscle torque, and muscle mass. Metabolomic analysis revealed that AMP in gastrocnemius muscle 10 days after STZ injection tended to accumulate more in KO mice than in WT mice. Consistently, expression levels of phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase at Thr172 were 2.0-fold higher in KO mice than in WT mice (P<0.05). In the STZ-treated groups, expression levels of MuRF1 (Muscle Ring Finger 1), an atrogene induced downstream of AMPK activation, were 1.9-fold higher in KO mice than in WT mice (p<0.05), indicating that AMPD3 suppresses excessive proteolysis by inhibiting the AMPK-MuRF1 pathway.

**Conclusion:**
The results suggest that AMPD3 has little effect on healthy muscle; however, AMPD3 may exert a protective effect against the progression of diabetes-induced sarcopenia by fine-tuning protein degradation during muscle energy starvation.

**Muscle-to-fat ratio combined with peripheral insulin sensitivity: a novel approach for differentiating diabetes of exocrine pancreas**

K. Sun, Y. ­Jin, Z. ­Zhou, L. ­Li

1. Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China, Endocrinology,

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes of exocrine pancreas (DEP), the sec- ond most common secondary diabetes after type 2 diabetes (T2DM), shares overlapping clinical features with T2DM, often leading to mis- diagnosis. This study aimed to identify novel discriminative markers by comparing clinical characteristics between DEP and T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
This case-control study enrolled patients with diabetes (n=40,aged 18-75 years, disease duration <5 years) from the Department of Endocrinology at a university hospital. Participants were divided into two groups matched 1:1 for age, sex, BMI, diabetes duration, and HbA1c: T2DM and DEP. The DEP group included post- acute pancreatitis diabetes (PPDM-A) and post-pancreatectomy dia- betes following benign pancreatic tumor resection. Body composition was assessed via bioelectrical impedance analysis. Peripheral insulin sensitivity was quantified using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (M-value). Glycemic variability was evaluated through 14-day con- tinuous glucose monitoring, analyzed using EasyGV software (version 9.0.R2). The comparison between two groups of data can be conducted using either an independent samples t-test or the Kruskal-Wallis H test.

**Results:**
The DEP group exhibited significantly higher peripheral insu- lin sensitivity (M-value: ) and muscle-to-fat ratio(MFR) ( ) compared to the T2DM. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in serum amylase, CA199, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, lipid profile, Homeo- stasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance , Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta Cell Function, triglyceride-glucose index, esti- mated glucose disposal rate, and glucose variability metrics ( ). Further analysis revealed that the PPDM-A subgroup had lower body fat content ( ), lower fat ratio ( ), and higher MFR ( ) compared to the T2DM group, with similar results observed in the post-surgery diabetes subgroup ( ). Additionally, the post-surgery diabetes group demonstrated a lower insulin resistance metabolic score ( 3). No statisti- cal differences were found in glucose variability metrics between the two subgroups of DEP and the T2DM group ( ). Furthermore, prealbumin, total bile acids, alkaline phosphatase, diastolic blood pres- sure, and liver fat content showed a decreasing trend across the T2DM, PPDM-A, and post-surgery groups, while the percentage of time below glucose target range increased, but none reached statistical significance (P>0.05).

**Conclusion:**
The MFR may serve as a critical clinical feature for distin- guishing DEP from T2DM. Furthermore, DEP patients demonstrated superior peripheral insulin sensitivity compared to T2DM, offering a novel perspective for differential diagnosis between these two diabetes subtypes.

3. versité Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada, Quebec Heart and Lung Research

**Background and aims:**
Bariatric surgery is the most effective long- term treatment for metabolic improvements in patients with severe obesity; however, the mechanisms contributing to these effects are not fully understood. Several studies reported altered circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and its binding proteins (IGFBPs) in obese patients. After bariatric surgery, physical exercise can help preserve muscle mass by increasing muscle protein synthesis, a pro- cess stimulated by the IGF-1 axis which can play a role in metabolic improvement. Therefore, the objective of this study was to document the modulation of the IGF axis (IGF-1 and IGFBPs) in severely obese patients undergoing or not a chronic aerobic exercise physical training program after bariatric surgery.

**Materials and methods:**
Fifty obese patients (mean age 41.9 ± 2.9 years, mean BMI 45.8 ± 6.0 kg/m , 38 women, 12 men) underwent either biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Patients were further randomized to par- ticipate (34 patients) or not (16 patients) in a 12-week aerobic exer- cise regimen. Physical training was conducted from the third to sixth months after surgery. Anthropometric measurements as well as circu- lating markers of the IGF-1 axis and glucose and lipid metabolism were assessed before, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after the surgery.

**Results:**
Circulating concentrations of total IGF-1 were not modulated by either surgery. Patients with SG showed higher free IGF-1 (fIGF- 1) levels 1 year after surgery than their counterparts with BPD-DS. Insulin levels robustly decreased after surgery in both SG and BPD-DS patients. BPD-DS increased IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 levels. SG had no impact on IGFBP-1 but stimulated IGFBP-2 levels two-fold. IGFBP-3 levels remained constant after both surgeries. Physical exercise had no impact on these variables of the IGF-1 axis. Postoperative 12-months changes in IGFBP-1 and -2 levels were negatively associated with fat mass loss. At 6 months after surgery, groups with higher IGFBP-2 levels had greater fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity.

**Conclusion:**
Irrespective of physical exercise, BPD-DS was asso- ciated with a robust increase in IGFBP-2 concentrations, as well as lower IGF-1 levels compared to SG, suggesting that malabsorptive or incretin-based mechanisms contribute to these effects. Bariatric surgery and exercise training only modestly impacted the IGF-1 axis, suggesting that the large increase in IGFBP-2 observed after BPD-DS may predominantly trigger IGF-independent effects to improve energy metabolism.

**Vitamin D supplementation as a protective strategy against aging- related metabolic disorders and sarcopenia**

H.-J. Jeong

**Background and aims:**
Aging is associated with an increased risk of metabolic disorders, including hepatic steatosis and sarcopenia, partly due to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D plays a critical role in meta- bolic regulation, skeletal muscle maintenance, and liver function. How- ever, whether vitamin D supplementation alone can mitigate aging- related metabolic dysfunctions remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of long-term vitamin D supplementation on metabolic disorders and sarcopenia in aged mice and compare these effects with those of regular exercise.

**Materials and methods:**
Young and aged C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: a normal diet group, a vitamin D-supplemented group (20,000 IU of vitamin D for four months), and an exercise group subjected to treadmill running. Serum vitamin D levels, body com- position, and metabolic parameters were assessed. Liver tissues were analyzed for gene expression changes through differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis, volcano plot visualization, and KEGG pathway analysis. Muscle function was evaluated by measuring cross-sectional area and muscle regeneration markers. The role of vitamin D in regulat- ing Apelin and its receptor APJ was further examined using promoter binding site analysis. All animal experiments were performed accord- ing to the guidelines of our National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Committee. Statistical significance was determined using one- way ANOVA, with a significance threshold set at p < 0.05.

**Results:**
The decreased serum vitamin D levels due to aging were significantly increased by vitamin D supplementation, along with an upregulation of vitamin D target gene expression in the liver and skeletal muscle. Aged mice on a normal diet showed increased body weight, liver weight, and fat mass, whereas those in the vitamin D supplementation and exercise groups exhibited suppressed weight gain and improved metabolic profiles. Elevated plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels in aged mice were significantly reduced by vitamin D supplementation.DEG and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that aging upregulated metabolic pathways related to dysglycemia, glu- cose metabolism disorders, insulin resistance, and obesity in the liver. Vitamin D supplementation suppressed these pathways, indicating a protective effect against hepatic metabolic dysfunction. In aged skeletal muscle, vitamin D improved muscle mass, cross-sectional area, and functional capacity, comparable to the effects of exercise. Notably, vita- min D supplementation increased the expression of Apelin and APJ, key myokines involved in muscle regeneration, via direct regulation through the vitamin D receptor (VDR).

**Conclusion:**
Vitamin D supplementation effectively mitigates aging- related metabolic disorders and sarcopenia by modulating metabolic gene expression in the liver and skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation could be a promising non-pharmaco- logical strategy for preventing age-associated metabolic diseases and muscle degeneration, potentially serving as an alternative or comple- mentary approach to exercise.

3. ern Denmark, Odense M, Denmark, Department of Endocrinology,

**Background and aims:**
Testosterone replacement therapy increases muscle mass and reduces fat mass in aging men with subnormal tes- tosterone levels. The latter is accompanied by reduced plasma lev- els of leptin and adiponectin. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these clinical effects of long-term testosterone replace- ment therapy in aging men with type 2 diabetes remain to be established.

**Materials and methods:**
Here, we examined abdominal subcuta- neous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies obtained before and after treatment with either testosterone gel (n=20) or placebo (n=19) for 6 months in aging men with low bioavailable testoster- one levels and type 2 diabetes. The testosterone-induced changes in selected markers of relevant pathways were examined by quantita- tive real-time PCR and western blotting.

**Results:**
Long-term testosterone replacement therapy increased lean body (placebo-controlled mean effect of intervention (β) = 1.9 kg, p = 0.001), and reduced total fat mass (β = -1.3 kg, p = 0.009). This was accompanied by a decrease in circulating lev- els of leptin (p<0.001) and adiponectin (p=0.045), but with no changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity (p=0.18). Compared with placebo, testosterone treatment did not cause changes in the transcript levels of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation ( ), extracellular matrix formation ( ), lipid metab- olism ( , , , , and ), adipokines ( and ), adipocyte differentiation ( ), and mac- rophage marker ( ) in adipose tissue. In line with the lack of changes in insulin sensitivity, testosterone replacement therapy had no effect on the abundance or insulin dependent phosphorylation of enzymes (AKT2, TBC1D4, GYS1) involved in insulin signal- ing. Finally, the improved muscle mass after testosterone treat- ment was not accompanied by changes in the protein abundance of the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, MuRF1 or Atrogin-1, or the autophagic markers (ULK1, ULK1 pSer757, or p62). However, the insulin-mediated inhibition of autophagy (LC3-II/I ratio) was improved only after testosterone replacement therapy (p=0.028), and the insulin-suppressed LC3-II/I ratio was lower after testoster- one replacement therapy compared with placebo (p=0.017).

**Conclusion:**
Our results provide evidence that the testosterone- induced changes in body composition in aging men with type 2 diabetes are not accompanied by sustained changes in transcrip- tional markers of adipose tissue mass or function or markers of pro- teasomal degradation in muscle, and in line with the lack of effect of testosterone replacement therapy on insulin sensitivity, markers of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle were not affected by testos- terone. Interestingly, testosterone replacement therapy enhanced insulin-mediated inhibition of autophagy in muscle pointing to an increased anabolic effect of insulin after testosterone treatment.

**Background and aims:**
Parathyroid due to the production of para- thyroid hormone provide along with vitamin D the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Even the normcalcemic non-renal hyperparathyroidism (NNHPT) can lead to numerous diseases of not only bones and joints but other body systems e.g. cardiovascular, nervous and others where calcium ions are involved in their physiology. The broad screening of serum content of para- thyroid hormone showed a wide prevalence of NNHPT, namely 10 % in the general population and 14 % in persons exposed to ionizing radiation. Study of the NNHPT and identification of other endocrine disorders and/or any somatic diseases in exposed persons was the study objective.

**Materials and methods:**
Persons exposed to ionizing radiation, namely the Chornobyl NPP accident survivors (n = 525), and non- exposed people (the comparison group, n = 219) were the study subjects. The routine clinical and anthropometric methods, diag- nostic visualization (parathyroid ultrasound scan), biochemical and hormonal assay, and statistical methods were applied.

**Results:**
Incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) among the irradiated and non-irradiated individuals was 25.9 % and 20.9 %, respectively (p > 0.05). Incidence of NNHPT among the irradiated individuals with T2D was 17% vs. 10.9 % in the non-irradiated persons. NNHPT was most common in the older age groups (after 50 years), in T2D patients and obese subjects. Basal serum con- centration of C-peptide was (2.9 ± 1.7) ng/ml and (3.1 ± 1.5) ng/ ml respectively, indicating to the hyperinsulinemia and being lower than (3.9 ± 0.9) ng/ml in the control (p > 0.05). The HOMA index in the Chornobyl NPP accident clean-up workers with diagnosed NNHPT was (5.9 ± 1.1) units vs. (5.4 ± 1.1) units in the con- trol (p > 0.05). Serum levels of parathyroid hormone significantly depended on the duration of T2D (r = 0.72, p = 0.001). Strong correlation was found between the concentration of parathyroid hormone and levels of C-peptide in the irradiated persons (r = 0.88; p = 0.0001). All the studied parameters and nosology’s were depended on the serum concentration of vitamin D.

**Conclusion:**
A strong correlation was found between the second- ary NNHPT and increased C-peptide concentration, HOMA index, incidence of prediabetes/diabetes and obesity. An increased inci- dence of secondary NNHPT was observed in the patients with clinically evident insulin resistance (17 % in irradiated individuals and 10.9 % in non-irradiated ones).

**Association between estimated glucose disposal rate and life’s essential 8 with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the U.S. adult population**

**Background and aims:**
The estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) is a reliable insulin resistance marker for both diabetic and nondia- betic populations. Life’s Essential 8 (LE8), was developed to evalu- ate cardiovascular health (CVH). This study examines the association between eGDR and both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in U.S. adults, along with its relationship to LE8.

**Materials and methods:**
This cohort study analyzed data from 19,626 U.S. adults (≥20 years) from the 2007-2018 NHANES. Weighted linear and logistic regression models assessed associa- tions between eGDR, CVH, and mortality. Restricted cubic splines modeled nonlinear relationships, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate survival outcomes. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the results.

**Results:**
Linear regression showed a significant positive associa- tion between eGDR and LE8 scores (β= 3.13, 95% CI: 3.02, 3.24; P < 0.0001). Quartile analysis revealed a dose-response relationship, with higher eGDR quartiles showing progressively higher LE8 scores (P for trend < 0.0001). Stratified analysis by CVH status revealed that higher eGDR levels were significantly associated with higher CVH, with the strongest association in the Q4 group (OR = 50.56, P < 0.0001). eGDR was associated with significantly lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Participants in Q3 (HR = 0.75, P = 0.007) and Q4 (HR = 0.59, P = 0.002) had lower mortality risks compared to Q1. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed these findings, showing higher survival rates for those with higher eGDR, especially in moderate CVH groups. This association was strongest in the nor- moglycemic population.

**Conclusion:**
Higher eGDR levels are associated with better cardio- vascular health and lower mortality, particularly in individuals with moderate CVH. Managing insulin resistance, especially in normogly- cemic populations, is crucial for improving cardiovascular outcomes.

**Most individuals with type 2 diabetes on intensified insulin therapy**

**Background and aims:**
In individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), metabolic decompensation may require intensified insulin therapy (IIT). In cases of absolute insulin deficiency, both bolus and basal insu- lin administration are necessary. The adequacy of basal insulin dosing can be assessed by controlled meal omission under continuous glucose monitoring, with the goal of maintaining stable fasting blood glucose levels. Absolute insulin deficiency is rare in individuals with T2D, who are also treated with additional antidiabetic agents. There is limited data on the proportion of individuals with T2D on IIT who require daytime basal insulin. Aims: To assess the proportion of individuals with T2D and IIT who require daytime basal insulin substitution.

**Materials and methods:**
A structured treatment and education pro- gram included 531 individuals with T2D (age 59.3±12.6 years, diabe- tes duration 9.3±8.8 years, BMI 31.2±7.1 kg/m², HbA1c 10.5±1.7%). Oral antidiabetic agents (OAD) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP- 1-RA) were adjusted according to guidelines. IIT was initiated with preprandial regular insulin and intermediate-acting insulin at night. Daytime basal insulins (degludec, detemir, glargine, and morning inter- mediate insulin) were discontinued. At the end of the BSP, participants underwent a standardized fasting glucose assessment: a defined portion of raw vegetables (200 g tomato, carrot, cucumber, bell pepper) was consumed, OAD or GLP-1-RA were administered, and blood glucose was measured at 8:00, 10:00, 12:00, and 14:00 without physical activ- ity. Water intake was allowed. A blood glucose increase of ≥2 mmol/L between 8:00 and 14:00 was considered clinically relevant. Participants on sulfonylurea therapy were excluded. The BSP was conducted in an outpatient diabetes care center.

**Results:**
A clinically relevant blood glucose increase was observed in 6.6% (n=35) of participants, with levels rising from 7.7±2.0 to 11.8±3.1 mmol/L (p < 0.001). In 93.4% (n=496), blood glucose lev- els decreased slightly from 8.5±2.1 to 7.4±1.8 mmol/L (p < 0.001). No moderate or severe hypoglycemia occurred. Higher blood glucose levels at 8:00 and shorter diabetes duration were associated with a greater decline in blood glucose.

**Conclusion:**
Only 6.6% of participants exhibited a clinically relevant increase in blood glucose without daytime basal insulin. These indi- viduals received daytime basal insulin to stabilize fasting blood glu- cose levels. The majority remained stable without basal insulin until 14:00. Routine prescription of daytime basal insulin in T2D patients on IIT is not required and may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. The results underline the importance of individualized therapy to avoid unnecessary risks and treatment burdens.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin clearance is a potential player in the deterioration of glycaemic control in non-diabetic subjects, but its link with other metabolic variables and their deterioration is still unclear. While previous cross-sectional studies have identi- fied independent associations between insulin clearance and other glucose homeostasis parameters, these associations have not been explored longitudinally. Here, we investigated the associations between OGTT-derived insulin clearance and metabolic parameters over 4-year follow-up through multivariate analysis in individuals at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D).

**Materials and methods:**
OGTTs were performed at months 0, 18 and 48 in white North European individuals from the IMI-DIRECT study ( =1831). OGTTs were used to derive oral insulin clearance (CLIo), insulin sensitivity (OGIS index), insulin secretion (ISR) and β-cell function parameters, i.e. β-cell glucose sensitivity (slope of the ISR-glucose relationship), rate sensitivity (marker of first-phase ISR), potentiation ratio (potentiation of ISR over the 2-h OGTT), and standardized ISR (ISR at fixed 6.3 mmol/L glucose). Other param- eters were investigated in our analysis, including time, ­HbA , fasting and incremental glucose, family history of T2D, life style, blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and ectopic fat from MRI (the latter with only baseline values and =816). The independent associations between changes (18 0 and 48 18 months) in CLIo and changes and/or baseline values of all other parameters were assessed via linear mixed-effect modelling through stepwise backward selection.

**Results:**
Longitudinal reduction of CLIo was found to be indepen- dently associated ( <0.001) with the following main longitudinal patterns ( =0.26): increasing insulin resistance (standardized =- 0.129) and BMI ( =-0.039), as expected; decreasing β-cell glucose sensitivity ( =0.014) and potentiation ratio ( =0.015) but increasing standardized ISR ( =-0.032), partially confirming our previously observed cross-sectional mitigation of β-cell dysfunction by reduced insulin clearance; increasing fasting ISR ( =-0.034), likely due to saturation mechanisms of insulin utilization. Moreover, increasing CLIo was independently associated with increasing fasting glucose over time ( =0.04), in agreement with our previous cross-sectional findings, suggesting that the increase of insulin clearance may be an independent factor contributing to glycaemic deterioration.

**Conclusion:**
Observing individuals at risk of developing T2D over four years, we identified longitudinal, independent associations between oral insulin clearance and distinct mechanisms of glucose homeostasis. The analysis extended at a longitudinal level the poten- tial existence of two adaptive processes involving oral insulin clear- ance: the first reduces insulin clearance with insulin resistance (and increasing BMI), the second reduces insulin clearance with lowering β-cell response to oral glucose. These processes are partially dys- regulated with increasing fasting glycaemic levels.

**Heat wave ahead: the effects of combined passive and active heat acclimation on thermal resilience and cardiometabolic health in older, overweight adults**

S. Pappa

**Background and aims:**
Climate change progresses and coincides with increasing prevalences of extreme heat events. The threat for heat-related complications is particularly pronounced among vul- nerable populations, such as older and overweight individuals. Heat acclimation (HA) is known to enhance thermal resilience to heat stress. Research has mostly focused on benefits of heat acclimation for exercise performance; however, those protocols do not apply to a broader, heat-vulnerable population. Previous work from our lab also demonstrated that passive heat acclimation, despite the mild heat stimulus, enhanced resilience to heat and improved glucose and fat metabolism in overweight older adults. This study aims to assess a combined passive and active heat acclimation approach, mimicking real-life outdoor temperature scenarios leading up to a heat wave, on thermophysiological, cardiovascular and metabolic parameters in over- weight, older adults.

**Materials and methods:**
8 volunteers (age 69±6 y, BMI 29.1±1.9 kg/ m ) underwent one control week and one week of passive heat acclima- tion (6h/d, 29-35 C) in combination with low-to-moderate intensity exercise (30min/d cycling, 40% ­W ). Test days T1, T2 were per- formed before and after the control week and T3 post HA. Each test day consisted of a 180-min incremental (28-45 C) heat stress test (HST) and a 240-min meal test (MT) in neutral temperature ­(21 C). Core tem- perature and heart rate were measured continuously via a telemetric pill and a chest belt, respectively. During the MT, participants consumed a high-fat drink (11.9 En% protein, 36.4 En% carbohydrates, 53.0% fat). Energy expenditure was measured via indirect calorimetry over a 4h postprandial period. During both weeks, interstitial glucose was measured with a continuous glucose monitor. Physiological variables are compared during the HST ­(45 C, 150-180 min) for pre vs. post HA. Outcomes were analysed with two-sided paired t-test between control (∆T2-T1) and post HA (∆T3-T2). Data represent mean±SD.

**Results:**
Changes in core temperature averaged -0.04±0.23 C at con- trol vs -0.12±0.17 C post HA (P=0.008). Post HA, heart rate was also decreased ­(45 C; P<0.001). Energy expenditure during MT was lower post HA (∆T2-T1 = 0.04±0.59kJ/min; ∆T3-T2 = -0.10±0.62 kJ/min, P<0.001). Respiratory exchange ratio was increased post HA (∆T2- T1 = -0.01±0.55; ∆T3-T2 = 0.01±0.62, P<0.001). Area under the curve (AUC) for interstitial glucose was higher during the HA week compared to the control week (P<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Preliminary results show that 7 days of combined passive and active HA significantly enhanced thermoregulation and reduced cardiovascular stress during heat exposure in older, overweight adults, suggesting a potential reduction of heat-health risks. Interestingly, early metabolic findings suggest a shift toward carbohydrate oxida- tion, which is in contrast to previous observations upon chronic heat exposure. Further analysis (powered group size n=10) at the end of the study is needed for definitive conclusions.

4. erach, Germany, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG,

**Background and aims:**
Survodutide, a glucagon receptor/gluca- gon-like peptide-1 receptor (GCGR/GLP-1R) dual agonist, elicited greater HbA1c reduction up to -1.71% vs semaglutide 1 mg (-1.47%) in a phase 2 trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. This analysis evalu- ated changes in insulin sensitivity, pancreatic islet cell function, and glucose biomarkers from three phase 1/2 trials of survodutide.

**Materials and methods:**
Descriptive statistics were derived from a phase 2 trial in patients living with obesity/overweight without dia- betes (Trial 1), a phase 2 trial in patients with type 2 diabetes (Trial 2), and a phase 1 study in patients living with obesity/overweight (Trial 3).

**Results:**
High survodutide doses improved insulinsensitivity as reflected in a decrease in mean absolute HOMA-IR scores frombaseline (BL) to the end of treatment (EOT), in contrast to no change orincrease with placebo (PBO): Trial 1, -1.1 (4.8 mg once weekly) vs -0.2 at Week46; Trial 2, -0.9 (1.8 mg twice weekly [BIW]) vs 0.9 at Week 17; and Trial 3,-1.0 (2.4 mg BIW following up titration) vs 0.3 at Week 16. Survodutideimproved HOMA-β, with mean percentagechange from BL to EOT consistently higher vs PBO: Trial 1, 8.6% vs -1.1%; Trial2, 88.0% vs 18.0%. In Trial 1, change from BL to Week 46 in FPG with- survodutide vs PBO was 0.4 vs 0.0 mmol/L. Change from BL in insulin andnon-fasting plasma glucose levels with survodutide 4.8 mg vs PBO, was -23.4 vs0.4 pmol/L and -0.0 vs 0.6 mmol/L, respectively. Addition- ally, mean change fromBL to Week 46 in adiponectin, glucagon, and c-peptide levels with survodutide4.8 mg vs PBO was 1.9 vs -0.15 mg/L, -15.2 vs -0.8 pmol/L, and -0.1 vs 0.0nmol/L, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Survodutide treatment showed improvement in markers of insulin sensitivity, pancreatic islet cell function, and glucose biomark- ers, in patients living with obesity/overweight and those with type 2 diabetes.

**Depressive symptoms and glucose-lipid metabolic dysregulation in obesity: a cross-sectional analysis**

S. Liu

**Background and aims:**
The coexistence of obesity and depression presents a significant public health challenge, with both conditions potentially sharing underlying mechanisms such as genetic predispo- sition, neuroendocrine alterations, immune responses, and psychoso- cial factors. Dysregulation in glucose and lipid metabolism, including insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia, may serve as critical links in this association. Understanding these interrelations is essential for developing targeted interventions.This study aims to: (1) investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms among patients with obesity; (2) compare demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters between patients with obesity with and without depression; and (3) identify independent metabolic risk factors associated with depres- sion in obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective cross-sec- tional analysis of medical records from 279 patients with obesity who attended the Obesity Specialty Clinic at our hospital between 2020 and 2024. Depression severity was assessed using standardized scales, categorizing patients into non-depressed and depressed groups (further subdivided into mild, moderate, and severe). Data on body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, postprandial insulin lev- els (30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes), fasting C-peptide, triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glucose area under the curve (AUC), insulin AUC, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), beta-cell function (HOMA-β), and insulin adiposity index (IAI) were collected. Statistical analyses included non-parametric tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression to identify independent predictors of depression.

**Results:**
Depressive symptoms were identified in 111 patients (39.8%), with 28.8% classified as mild, 58.6% as moderate, and 12.6% as severe. Compared to non-depressed individuals, the depressed group exhibited significant differences in BMI (Z = -2.02, P < 0.05), fasting blood glucose (Z = -2.45, P < 0.01), fasting insulin (Z = -4.37, P < 0.05), insulin levels at 30 minutes (Z = -2.17, P < 0.01), 60 minutes (Z = -2.96, P < 0.01), 120 minutes (Z = -3.72, P < 0.01), and 180 minutes (Z = -2.91, P < 0.01), fasting C-peptide (Z = -3.53, P < 0.01), triglycerides (Z = -2.44, P < 0.01), glucose AUC 0-180min (Z = -2.47, P < 0.01), insulin AUC 0-180min (Z = -3.44, P < 0.01), HOMA-IR (Z = -4.82, P < 0.01), HOMA-β (Z = -3.57, P < 0.01), and IAI (Z = -2.36, P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis identified BMI (OR = 0.934, P = 0.04), insulin AUC 0-180min (OR = 1.002, P = 0.027), cholesterol (OR = 0.066, P = 0.008), and LDL (OR = 7.920, P = 0.003) as significant predictors of depression in patients with obesity.

**Conclusion:**
There is a substantial prevalence of depressive symptoms among patients with obesity, with significant associations observed between depression and various metabolic parameters. Notably, higher insulin AUC and LDL levels were associated with increased depres- sion risk, while higher BMI and cholesterol levels appeared inversely related to depression. These findings underscore the complex interplay between metabolic dysregulation and mental health in obesity.

**The relationship between insulin sensitivity, secretion, clearance and atherosclerosis in a middle-aged population without diabetes: a cross-sectional study**

R. Renklint

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), primarily through the promotion of atherosclerosis. However, the risk of CVD already increases in the prediabetic state. The aim of this study was to investigate the associa- tions between insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and insulin clearance and subclinical atherosclerosis in a middle-aged population without diabetes or known atherosclerotic CVD.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional analysis was based on the Swedish CArdioPulmonary BioImage Study (SCAPIS), a large, multicenter, population-based cohort designed to improve risk pre- diction for CVD and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Men and women aged 50-64 years were randomly recruited from six centers in Sweden. This study is based on a sub-cohort of 2,507 partici- pants from our university’s center. Insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and insulin clearance were derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Atherosclerosis was assessed by coronary computed tomog- raphy angiography (CCTA) and carotid ultrasound. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores and segment involvement scores (SIS) were obtained from CCTA, while carotid plaque burden was determined by ultrasound. Regression models were used to analyze the associations between insulin metrics and atherosclerosis, adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (age, sex, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level, smoking and hypertension).

**Results:**
Reduced insulin sensitivity was independently associated with higher CAC scores, greater SIS, and increased carotid plaque burden. Lower insulin clearance showed similar trends, but these associations did not remain significant after adjustment for confounding factors. No significant association was found between insulin secretion and atherosclerosis.

**Conclusion:**
In this middle-aged population without diabetes or clini- cally manifest atherosclerotic CVD, lower insulin sensitivity was asso- ciated with subclinical atherosclerosis across multiple vascular ter- ritories. We did not find a direct link between secretion or clearance and atherosclerosis.

**Background and aims:**
Physical activity is important in the treat- ment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Moreover, the daily time in sedentary (SED) behavior is increasingly recognized as an independent detrimen- tal factor and we questioned whether it may influence development of long-term complications.

**Materials and methods:**
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in 302 persons with T2DM participating in the Diabetes and LifEstyle Cohort Twente (DIALECT). During the baseline visit, micro- and macrovascular complications were registrated. Patients wore a Fitbit (Flex, Charge HR, or Charge 2) for 5 consecutive days, maintaining their usual activities and keeping a diary for non-wear and sleep time. Periods of SED behavior were defined as 30 minutes 0 step/min with a maximum interruption of 20 steps/min because arm movements. Total minutes of SED behaviour per day were calculated. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between SED behaviour and the presence of at least one micro- and macrovascular complica- tions and for each of the microvascular complications. All models were adjusted for gender, diabetes duration and age.

**Results:**
Mean age was 65 (± 11) years, 66% was male, median dia- betes duration was 18 (8-20) years with a mean HbA1c 61 (± 13) mmol/mol (7,7%), mean BMI 31 (± 5) kg/m2 and 69% used insulin therapy. Micro- and macrovascular complications were respectively present in 73% and 33% of the patients. Mean SED duration was 443 (± 152) minutes per day. No significant effects were seen for the adjusted model for microvascular complications OR 1.001 (95%CI 0.999-1.003; 0.259) and macrovascular complications OR:1.001 (95%CI 0.999-1.003; 0.329). However, significant effects were seen for the association of SED behavior with nephropathy (OR 1.002 (CI 1.000-1.004; : 0.048)) and neuropathy (OR 1.002 (CI 1.000-1.004; : 0.046)).

**Conclusion:**
People with T2DM and nephropathy or neuropathy dis- play more SED behavior, independent of age. No claims on causality can be made based on these cross-sectional analyses. Further research should examine whether decreasing SED behavior in T2DM patients can reduce these long-term complications.

**Background and aims:**
Post-acute pancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PPDM-A) has become the most common subtype of pancreatogenic diabetes, which accounts for more than 60%. However, the natural history of PPDM-A is unclear. This study aims to determine the characteristics of disease progression at each progressive stage of PPDM-A.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) to investigate the glucose and C-peptide responses in indi- viduals with PPDM-A, pre-diabetes mellitus (Pre-DM) after acute pan- creatitis, recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) with euglycemia, acute pancreatitis (AP) with euglycemia, compared to normal controls (NC). Blood samples were collected to measure fasting and postprandial lev- els of serum glucose and C-peptide at different time points. Insulin sensitivity and secretion indices were calculated and compared among groups.

**Results:**
A total of 61 participants were recruited and underwent MMTT. Of those, 12 were controls, 12 had AP, 12 had RAP, 12 had Pre-DM, and 13 had PPDM-A. There is no significant difference in age, sex and BMI distribution among groups. The levels of HbA1c and glucose at each point in PPDM-A patients were markedly higher than the other four groups. Although HbA1c and fasting glucose were similar, the levels of one-hour and two-hour postprandial glucose of Pre-DM patients were significantly higher than AP, RAP and NC groups. Compared to NC, fasting C-peptide levels increased gradu- ally from AP, RAP, Pre-DM to PPDM-A patients. In the meantime, time-to-peak of C-peptide delayed gradually from 30-min (AP group), one-hour (RAP and Pre-DM groups), to two-hour time point (PPDM- A group). Insulin sensitivity at fasting indicated by HOMA2%-IS was significantly decreased in Pre-DM and PPDM-A groups compared to controls. Insulin sensitivity in postprandial state indicated by Matsuda index was all decreased in the four disease groups compared to NC. Patients with Pre-DM and PPDM-A were characterized by remarkably compromised β-cell insulin secretion at fasting condition evaluated by HOMA2%-β. Patients with PPDM-A also showed a reduced postpran- dial insulin secretion calculated by Stumvoll index.

**Conclusion:**
Pancreatic islet function and insulin sensitivity are impaired gradually in the disease progression from AP to PPDM-A. These findings may help understand the pathogenesis of diabetes devel- opment in the setting of AP.

**Background and aims:**
High-protein diets influence metabolic responses, including glucagon and insulin secretion, depending on the protein type. This effect may be linked to differences in amino acid (AA) composition and absorption kinetics. AAs stimulate glucagon release, which also promotes liver fat oxidation and insulin secretion. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been linked to diabetes risk, influencing metabolic pathways related to insulin sensitivity.We aim to characterize the response of glucagon, insulin, C-peptide, and AAs to 30g of different protein types. Specifically, we investigate the effects of slow- and fast-digesting milk proteins (whey and casein) and a pea protein.

**Materials and methods:**
This randomized controlled trial included ten individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and ten without. Par- ticipants completed seven investigation days in a random order. Each participant underwent mixed-meal tolerance tests with double-blind drinks containing one of six different whey-to-casein protein ratios or a pea protein drink. All beverages provided 30g protein.

**Results:**
20 participants (50% female, mean age 59 years, BMI of 32kg/ m²) were included. Fasted and postprandial glucose and C-peptide lev- els of the T2D group were significantly higher than those of the control group, with no basal insulin differences. Glucose, insulin and C-peptide did not show significantly differ between the seven drinks between and within groups. Glucagon values were higher in the T2D group and not significantly different between drinks. However, in the control group, postprandial glucagon was significantly higher after consumption of protein drinks with 80% casein and 20% whey and significantly lower with 10% casein and 90% whey, when compared to pure casein or pea protein drinks. The amino acid analysis revealed significant differences between control and T2D groups. Arginine AUC differed in response to 100% whey and significant differences were also found in alanine iAUC after 90% whey and 10% casein drink and methionine iAUC after drinks containing pure casein. Comparing drinks across the control group, we found significant differences in the AUC of phenylalanine, proline, and tryptophan. In the diabetes group, significant differences between drinks were only observed for tryptophan. No correlations were found between BCAA levels and metabolic markers.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the impact of protein type on gluca- gon secretion and its role in postprandial glucose regulation. In con- trols, casein promoted a slower, more gradual release and whey caused a quicker release. Implying that selecting the appropriate protein type could help modulate glucagon secretion, thereby improving metabolic outcomes. In contrast, while T2D patients had higher glucagon lev- els overall, there were no significant differences between the protein drinks, indicating a possible dysregulation of glucagon. No correlations were found between BCAA levels and metabolic markers, emphasiz- ing the complexity of BCAA-related metabolic regulation. Although epidemiological studies suggest plant-based proteins have benefits, our results showed minor differences between animal and plant proteins in their pure forms, suggesting isolated plant proteins may have less pronounced effects.

**Background and aims:**
Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have an increased lifelong risk of fractures with studies reporting low bone turnover, reduced bone mineral density, and altered bone microarchi- tecture. Pancreatic beta cell destruction leading to amylin deficiency in type 1 diabetes may influence bone metabolism, as preclinical research suggests that amylin decreases bone resorption and enhances bone formation. Here, we investigated the effect of a continuous i.v. infu- sion of the amylin analogue pramlintide on bone turnover markers in individuals with type 1 diabetes and matched healthy controls under fasting conditions.

**Materials and methods:**
In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study, 10 C-peptide negative individuals with type 1 diabetes (age 28.9 ± 5.1 years (mean ± SD), BMI 24.2 ± 2.5 kg/ m², HbA1c 45.7 ± 8.0) and 10 gender, age and BMI-matched healthy controls (age 28.5 ± 7.1 years, BMI 24.3 ± 2.1 kg/m², HbA1c 29.6 ± 3.4), attended two test days under fasting conditions each involv- ing a 3-hour i.v. infusion of pramlintide (3.0 pmol/kg/min) or placebo (saline). Individuals with type 1 diabetes took their regular basal insulin as usual; no bolus insulin was administered on test days. Bone turnover was evaluated by measuring circulating levels of the bone resorption marker C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I col- lagen (CTX) and bone formation marker procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP). Differences in AUC was assessed using a two-level mixed model ANOVA, and relative changes in CTX were calculated as percentage changes from baseline to nadir.

**Results:**
Individuals with type 1 diabetes tended to have lower fasting plasma levels of CTX compared to controls ( = 0.14) and pramlintide significantly reduced CTX compared to placebo ( < 0.01) in both indi- viduals with type 1 diabetes (AUC 29.0 ± 2.81 (mean ± SEM) vs 74.1 ± 11.4 min×ng/mL) and healthy controls (AUC 33.5 ± 6.64 vs 101.0 ± 21.4 min×ng/mL ) with no difference between groups ( = 0.23) and similar percentage nadirs (average decrease of 90.9% in individu- als with type 1 diabetes and 89.8% in controls ( = 0.91)) (figure 1a). Fasting plasma P1NP levels were similar in the two groups ( = 0.64) and compared to placebo, pramlintide did not change P1NP levels in both groups ( = 0.50) (figure 1b).

**Conclusion:**
We demonstrate that a continuous i.v. infusion of the amylin analogue pramlintide potently reduces bone resorption without affecting bone formation in individuals with type 1 diabetes as well as in healthy controls.

**Background and aims:**
The Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) system is a novel endocrinological system with an important role in multiple metabolic pathways, among others insulin and lipid metabolism. Most data of this system have been collected in the fasting situation. The non-fasting changes have been less well studied. We aimed to evalu- ate the postprandial changes in FGF-19 and FGF-21 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in relation to cardiometabolic and endocrinological parameters.

**Materials and methods:**
In this single centre study fourteen male patients with T2DM underwent an eight-hours standardized oral fat loading test. Every two hours FGF-19 and FGF-21 among other car- diometabolic parameters in blood were collected. Postprandial response was measured using the area-under-the curve (AUC).

**Results:**
Fourteen males with T2DM with a mean age of 64.6 ± 8.6 (x ± SD) years and BMI of 29.4 ± 3.9 kg/m² were included. Compared with fasting, the mean concentration of FGF-19 (109.2 ±126.3 pg/mL) increased gradually and was maximal at six hours (289.1±143.5 pg/ mL). In contrast, FGF-21 showed the opposite effect and decreased by 32% compared to fasting (423.2±395.5 pg/mL to 289,6 ± 258,4 pgm/ ml), almost returning to baseline at later timepoints. Interindividual differences exist in fasting and postprandial response of FGF-19 and FGF-21. There was a positive correlation between fasting FGF-19 and postprandial FGF-19 and fasting FGF-21 and postprandial FGF-21. No correlation existed between FGF-19 and FGF-21, neither were they associated with fasting or postprandial glucagon or insulin lev- els. Patients with a low FGF-19 AUC had significantly lower ALAT (P=0.014), ASAT (P=0.048), plasma cholesterol (P=0.016), LDL-C (P=0.011) and apoB (P=0.026) than patients with a high FGF-19 AUC. Patients with a lower FGF-21 AUC had higher fasting free fatty acids (P= 0.004).

**Conclusion:**
This study suggests that FGF-19 and FGF-21 tend to change postprandially, with a positive correlation between fasting and postprandial values. Interindividual postprandial responses in patients with diabetes are high. Lower FGF-19 is associated with lower choles- terol levels, which could be explained by FGF-19 effects on bile acid metabolism. The negative correlation between FGF-21 and free fatty acids in patients with type 2 diabetes could be explained by FGF-21 effects on lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation.

**Background and aims:**
Alterations in appetite regulation may con- tribute to impaired glycaemic control in individuals with prediabe- tes. However, whether differences in postprandial hormone responses and subjective appetite patterns are already present in this population remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate differences in postpran- dial satiety hormone dynamics and appetite profiles between adults with prediabetes and overweight/obesity and healthy (normoglycaemic, normal-weight) individuals.

**Materials and methods:**
The Kronodiabet study is a 2-week observa- tional trial including 33 adults, matched by age and sex: 16 individuals with overweight/obesity and untreated prediabetes (PreD) and 17 nor- moglycaemic, normal-weight controls (NGT). Participants underwent a 12.5-h controlled in-lab protocol, during which they consumed four standardized meals adjusted to estimated total energy expenditure. Sub- jective appetite was assessed using 100-mm visual analogue scales (VAS) for hunger, satiety, desire to eat, and prospective food intake before and after each meal, and at 90 and 180 min post-meal, covering a full 14-h active phase. Blood samples were taken at fasting and at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post-breakfast to measure glucose, insulin and acylated-ghrelin. Mixed-effects and regression models were used to assess group differences, adjusting for age, sex and total caloric intake, and accounting for repeated measurements when appropriate.

**Results:**
Participants in the PreD group (9/16 women; 56.4 ± 3.8 y; BMI: 35.4 ± 7.2) had higher fasting blood glucose (115.1 ± 13.3 mg/ dL) and HbA1c (5.9 ± 0.3%) compared with NGT (11/17 women; 53.0 ± 6.6 y; BMI: 20.9 ± 5.2; glucose: 87.1 ± 6.5 mg/dL; HbA1c: 5.4 ± 0.2%) (both p < 0.001). Postprandial 2-h iAUC for glucose and insulin were significantly larger in PreD vs. NGT (both p < 0.001). Although no overall group differences were detected in acylated- ghrelin iAUC (p = 0.137), a significant group × time interaction was found (p < 0.001). At 30 and 60 min post-breakfast, ghrelin suppres- sion from baseline was significantly greater in NGT than in PreD (−423 pmol/L, p = 0.006; −351 pmol/L, p = 0.022). After breakfast, prospective food intake net iAUC (0-180 min) was higher in PreD compared with NGT (p = 0.033), with no group differences for the composite appetite score (p = 0.137). During the 14-h active phase, prospective food intake net iAUC remained significantly higher in PreD (adjusted mean difference: 13.75 mm·h; p = 0.005), while no differences were observed in hunger, desire to eat or overall appetite score.

**Conclusion:**
Under standardized dietary conditions, individuals with prediabetes and overweight/obesity exhibited impaired ghrelin sup- pression following breakfast and persistently elevated prospective food intake throughout the day. These findings suggest early impair- ments in satiety regulation that may contribute to excess energy intake and highlight the relevance of individualized nutritional strategies in the early stages of dysglycaemia.

**Background and aims:**
The impact of atmospheric pressure changes on glucose metabolism encountered in aviation on people with type 1 diabetes is controversial. A dual-isotope study was performed in a hypobaric chamber to simulate pressure changes experienced on commercial flights.

**Materials and methods:**
A randomised cross-over study of fasting and postprandial glucose kinetics of individuals with type 1 diabe- tes were evaluated across simulated in-flight cabin pressures (550 mmHg; experimental arm) and ground level (750 mmHg; control arm). The impact of ambient pressure on glucose disposal (Rd), endogenous glucose production (EGP), meal glucose appearance (Ra), and insulin concentrations were evaluated.

**Results:**
Six male participants, aged 20-61 years, with a median BMI of 26.6 kg/m were studied. Baseline glucose Rd, EGP, and meal Ra were not affected by ambient pressure changes (p>0.05). Postpran- dial glucose Rd was higher in hypobaric conditions than ground (p=0.028), percent change in postprandial glucose concentration was lower but postprandial EGP and meal Ra were not affected. Insulin concentration between 120-180 min was higher in the hypobaric simulation (p=0.028).

**Conclusion:**
The observed increase in glucose Rd for individuals with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy may be related to the hypoxia and pressure changes experienced during flight. Since glu- cose profiles were unaffected, there is no evidence that insulin pump therapy is a risk factor in a normal flight.

4. ment of Psychology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland, Department

**Background and aims:**
Insulin plays a crucial role not only in regu- lating substrate metabolism but also in modulating blood flow to vari- ous tissues. In some of previous research, insulin’s vasoactive effects are impaired in skeletal muscle in insulin resistance, possibly in part leading to reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. However, little is known about its effects on other tissues. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of insulin on blood flow across multiple tissues simultaneously and to compare these effects between individuals with obesity and lean controls.

**Materials and methods:**
11 individuals with obesity (mean BMI 37.1 [SD 5.7] kg/m , 8 women) and 9 lean controls (mean BMI 21.4 [SD 2.0] kg/m ), 8 women) underwent three consecutive, whole- body radiowater positron emission tomography (PET) scans: one under fasting conditons, one after 10 min of hyperinsulinemic, eug- lycemic clamp and one 50 minutes into the clamp. Changes in blood flow to the tissue (K1, ml blood/[min × 100 g tissue]) were quanti- fied from different tissues and analysed using repeated measures ANOVA.

**Results:**
Skeletal muscle was the only tissue where obesity was asso- ciated with altered the perfusion response (Table 1). In lean controls, muscle perfusion initially decreased by an average of 10%, followed by a 20% increase after 50 minutes of hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, individuals with obesity exhibited the opposite pattern, with an ini- tial increase in muscle perfusion followed by a later decrease. Insulin induced a transient increase in perfusion in the kidney cortex, adre- nal glands, thyroid gland and duodenal wall, and a steady decrease in pancreatic perfusion similarly in both groups (Table 1), while not affecting cerebral or myocardial perfusion. Perfusion was con- stantly increased in kidney cortex and reduced in the brain, adrenal glands, thyroid gland and duodenal wall in individuals with obesity (Table 1).

**Conclusion:**
Obesity is associated with reduced perfusion in the brain, adrenal glands, thyroid gland, and duodenal wall, while perfu- sion is increased in the kidney cortex. Although insulin’s vasoactive effects appear to be altered in skeletal muscle, this finding may also reflect changes in whole-body perfusion, underscoring the impor- tance of assessing systemic blood flow when investigating tissue- specific vascular responses. Further analyses on adipose tissue and the liver, as well as the relationship between tissue perfusion and glucose metabolism assessed with ­[ F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, will be completed before the Annual Meeting in September.

**Background and aims:**
Fibrosis can be commonly found in patients with advanced type 1 or type 2 diabetes and diabetic complications. Hyperglycemia, lipotoxic injury and insulin resistance can trigger secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) and promote epithelial-to-mes- enchymal transition (EMT) in several organs. Insulin-like Growth Fac- tor Binding Protein 5 (IGFBP5) is upregulated in fibrotic diseases and has been found to be involved in diabetic kidney disease progression. The mechanism and the receptor mediating the effects of IGFBP5 are unknown. Here we aimed at studying the pro-fibrotic role of IGFBP5 in promoting EMT and ECM deposition.

**Materials and methods:**
A549, primary epithelial cells and primary fibroblasts were used as models. The expression/secretion of fibronectin and collagen were assessed by qRT-PCR, western blot and ELISA and used as markers of fibrosis.

**Results:**
We demonstrate that IGFBP5 is expressed in fibroblasts and epithelial cells, and it is highly released by epithelial cells. The fibrotic factor TGF-β1 promotes IGFBP5 expression in fibroblasts and epi- thelial cells. We show that IGFBP5 promotes the TGF-β1-dependent EMT in terms of fibronectin and collagen expression and deposition in epithelial cells. On the contrary, IGFBP5 silencing/blockade in epi- thelial cells prevents the TGF-β1 fibrogenic response. Importantly, we identified CD248 as a potential membrane receptor of IGFBP5 mediating its profibrotic activity. CD248 is upregulated by TGF-β1 in epithelial cells, suggesting an enhanced activity of the IGFBP5/CD248 axis in the fibrotic response. The blockade of CD248 reverted the IGFBP5-dependent EMT and ECM deposition.

**Conclusion:**
Our data characterize for the first time the IGFBP5/ CD248 axis and its role in promoting fibrogenic response and EMT in epithelial cells and elucidates a new signaling axis that can be targeted as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat fibrosis in diabetic complications.

**Sex-specific differences in lipid induced insulin resistance: enhanced adipose tissue adaptation in females**

T. Fleming, Rauchhaupt, M. Campos Campos, Z. Kender, A. Sulaj, J. Szendroedi

**Background and aims:**
Sex-specific differences in lipid metabo- lism are well established, but their contribution to insulin sensitiv- ity remains insufficiently understood. This study aimed to assess how lipid availability differentially affects metabolic responses in males and females, with a particular focus on adipose tissue function and insulin sensitivity.

**Materials and methods:**
Ten lean, metabolically healthy individuals with normal glucose tolerance (6 males, 4 females) underwent ran- domised glycerol (control, CON) or lipid (LIP) infusion followed by a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp. Females were studied in the luteal phase. Blood samples were collected at baseline, during infu- sion, and during the clamp. Insulin sensitivity (M-value, M/I ratio), triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids (FFA), adipose-IR, and metabolic flexibility (ΔRQ) were assessed. Adiponectin and leptin were analysed as regulatory markers. Paired t-tests and two-way ANOVA were used for statistical analysis.

**Results:**
Lipid infusion raised FFA levels by 73%, reducing whole- body insulin sensitivity by >20% in 4/6 males, whereas all females remained below this threshold. After 4 hours, TG levels were 77% higher in males (344 ± 103 vs. 194 ± 48 mg/dL; p=0.02), despite equal lipid infusion rates, indicating lower lipid clearance. ΔRQ did not differ significantly between sexes (-0.12 ± 0.07 vs. -0.06 ± 0.10; p=0.76), though males showed a significant RQ decline (0.66 ± 0.08 to 0.55 ± 0.02; p=0.002), suggesting increased lipid oxidation. FFA suppression during the clamp was stronger in females (71.8 ± 8.1% vs. 54.4 ± 10.5%; p=0.02). Adipo-IR rose by 75% in males (p<0.0001), while females showed no significant change. Adiponectin levels were higher in females (p<0.05), indicating enhanced adipose tissue insulin sensitivity.

**Conclusion:**
Males exhibit greater susceptibility to lipid-induced insulin resistance, likely due to lower adipose lipid storage capacity despite higher lipid oxidation. In contrast, females demonstrate meta- bolic advantages, including improved FFA suppression and higher adiponectin levels, conferring protection against insulin resistance. These findings highlight the key role of adipose tissue in sex-specific metabolic adaptation and support the need for tailored strategies to reduce cardiometabolic risk.

**Characterisation of beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in intermediate hyperglycaemia subtypes based on combinations of fasting, 1-hour and 2-hour plasma glucose**

C. O, R. Ma, A. Luk, J. Chan

**Background and aims:**
In a recent position statement, the Interna- tional Diabetes Federation recommends addition of 1-hour plasma glu- cose (PG) ≥8.6 mmol/L to define intermediate hyperglycemia (IH). We aimed to explore the relative contribution of beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in IH-subtypes with different combinations of fasting PG (FPG), 1-hour and 2-hour PG in Chinese population.

**Materials and methods:**
Participants came from two Hong Kong community-based cohorts, the Hong Kong Family Diabetes Study (HKFDS) and Better Health for Better Hong Kong (BHBHK), estab- lished in 1998-2003, with metabolic profiling at baseline including 5-timepoint oral glucose tolerance test. We included all individuals without diabetes at baseline. Normal glucose tolerance (NGT) was defined as FPG<5.6 mmol/L, 1-hour PG<8.6 mmol/L and 2-hour PG<7.8 mmol/L; IFG was defined as FPG≥5.6 mmol/L; high 1-hour PG (High-1hPG) as 1-hour PG≥8.6 mmol/L; and IGT as 2-hour PG≥7.8 mmol/L. Beta-cell function was assessed by insulinogenic index and oral disposition index while insulin sensitivity was assessed by Matsuda index. We excluded participants with values of these indi- ces outside ±2 standard deviations. We used generalized estimating equation linear regression with exchangeable matrix to account for intra-family correlation and compared the indices among groups strati- fied by FPG, 1-hour and 2-hour PG.

**Results:**
Among 1107 participants [median age (IQR)=40 (31, 47) years, 45% male, body mass index=23 (21, 26) kg/m ], the distribution of IH-subgroups were NGT (54.6%), isolated-IFG (1.0%), isolated- High-1hPG (24.3%), isolated-IGT (1.9%), Normal-FPG/High-1hPG/ IGT (10.8%), IFG/High-1hPG/Normal-2hPG (3.4%), and IFG/High- 1hPG/IGT (4%). As a continuous trait, 1-hour PG was a more sensitive marker than 2-hour PG for Matsuda index, insulinogenic index and oral disposition index ( for difference in slopes all <0.05). Isolated High- 1hPG had lower Matsuda index (β=-4.5, p<0.001), insulinogenic index (β=-50.4, p<0.001) and oral disposition index (β=-1.34, p<0.001) than NGT, and the differences in medians of the indices were -30%, -42% and -43% respectively between the two groups. With isolated-High- 1hPG as the reference group, isolated-IGT (β=0.89, =0.61) had simi- lar Matsuda index which progressively declined from Normal-FPG/ High-1hPG/IGT (β=-2.4, =0.006), IFG/High-1hPG/Normal-2hPG (β=-2.8, p=0.037) to IFG/High-1hPG/IGT (β=-5.1, <0.001). Insu- linogenic index in Isolated-High-1hPG was similar to Normal-FPG/ High-1hPG/IGT (β=-3.5, =0.73) and IFG/High-1hPG/Normal-2hPG (β=-0.47, =0.98) but lower than Isolated-IGT (β=49.6, =0.018). Similar results were observed for oral disposition index as in insuli- nogenic index.

**Conclusion:**
Isolated-High-1hPG was characterized by both impaired insulin sensitivity and beta-cell dysfunction. While isolated IFG and isolated IGT were rare events, the coexistence of IFG or IGT increased insulin resistance but did not add significantly to the beta-cell dysfunc- tion in the High-1PG group. This heterogeneity of IH suggested that improving beta-cell function might be an important strategy for preven- tion of diabetes in Chinese population.

**Background and aims:**
Acanthosis nigricans (AN), a cutaneous marker of insulin resistance (IR), is prevalent in overweight/obese individuals and associated with metabolic disorders. While HOMA-IR, TyG-BMI, and METS-IR are widely used IR indices, their comparative ability to predict AN remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate these indices for AN risk stratification.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study included 1,077 overweight/obese adults (BMI ≥24 kg/m²). Participants were classified into AN (n=446) and non-AN (n=631) groups based on clinical cri- teria. Three IR indices were calculated from fasting blood parameters and BMI. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for demographics, metabolic factors, and hormonal levels assessed associations. Predic- tive performance was compared using ROC curves.

**Results:**
AN patients showed significantly higher IR indices than con- trols (HOMA-IR: 7.11 ± 3.37 vs. 5.37 ± 3.09; TYG-BMI: 319.54 ± 43.13 vs. 293.85 ± 49.00; METS-IR: 57.74 ± 9.20 vs. 52.19 ± 9.33, P < 0.05). Multivariable-adjusted models demonstrated significant positive associations between IR indices and AN occurrence, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.01 ~ 1.14) for HOMA- IR, 1.11 (95% CI: 1.04 ~ 1.19) for TYG-BMI and 1.07 (95% CI: 1.03 ~ 1.10) for METS-IR.After full adjustment, METS-IR exhibited the strongest association with AN risk (Q4 vs. Q1: OR=4.31, 95% CI:1.92-9.69; P-trend<0.001) and the highest predictive accuracy (AUC=0.670), surpassing HOMA-IR (AUC=0.643) and TyG-BMI (AUC=0.655). Subgroup analyses indicated consistent results across sex, age, and metabolic subgroups.

**Conclusion:**
METS-IR outperformed HOMA-IR and TYG-BMI in pre- dicting AN risk, highlighting its potential as a cost-effective screening tool for obesity-related metabolic disorders.

**Metabolic memory induced by morning insulin exposure enhances liver responsiveness to a subsequent glucose load later in the day**

H. Waterman, T. Howard, D. Edgerton, A. Cherrington

**Background and aims:**
The second-meal phenomenon, characterized by an improved glycemic response following a second identical meal, is observed in both healthy individuals and those with diabetes, yet its underlying cause remains incompletely understood. This study aims to investigate the physiological and molecular drivers of this effect using a canine model with sequential glucose clamps and liver tissue analyses.

**Materials and methods:**
Dogs underwent a morning euglycemic clamp with either a 4-hour hyperinsulinemic prime (Prime, n=8) or basal insulin delivery (NoPrime, n=9). After a 1.5-hour rest period, both groups underwent an afternoon 2.5-hour hyperinsulinemic-hyper- glycemic (HIHG) clamp to simulate postprandial conditions. To elu- cidate the molecular basis of observed metabolic changes, bulk RNA sequencing was performed on liver tissue collected at the end of the rest period prior to the onset of the PM clamp. Additionally, liver tissue samples were submitted for proteomic analysis via LC-MS, which is currently ongoing.

**Results:**
Flux data from the PM HIHG clamp revealed that prior AM insulin exposure significantly enhanced hepatic glucose handling. Specifically, net hepatic glucose uptake increased 2.5-fold (6.1 ± 0.6 vs. 2.4 ± 0.4 mg/kg/min), direct glycogen synthesis was three times higher (3.2 ± 0.6 vs. 1.0 ± 0.1 mg/kg/min), and glycolytic flux doubled (1.7 ± 0.1 vs. 0.8 ± 0.1 mg/kg/min) in the Prime group relative to the NoPrime group. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that insulin prim- ing induced significant shifts in the hepatic transcriptional landscape. Upregulated genes involved in glucose metabolism (GCK, PFKP, SREBF1, PGM2, EPAS1) promoted glycolysis and glucose utilization, while genes regulating insulin signaling (PIK3C2G, PRKCE, HRAS, PTPN11) were enhanced alongside lipogenic-related genes (ACSL4, FABP6). In contrast, gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic genes (FBP1, GPD1, AQP9, MPC1, AGL), beta-oxidation-related genes (ACACB, PPARGC1B, DECR1), and ketogenesis-related genes (HADHA) were downregulated. Additionally, bile acid synthesis (CYP7A1) was sup- pressed, while glycolytic intermediates may have indirectly activated the pentose phosphate pathway to support NADPH production for reductive biosynthesis.

**Conclusion:**
These findings demonstrate that morning insulin prim- ing optimizes hepatic glucose uptake, storage, and metabolism during subsequent meals. The transcriptional changes align closely with flux data and demonstrate how prior insulin exposure reprograms hepatic metabolism to enhance glucose handling later in the day. These results highlight the concept of hepatic metabolic memory, where prior insulin exposure adjusts the liver’s metabolic set point for future nutritional and hormonal challenges. This study underscores the pivotal role of insulin priming in enhancing hepatic glucose control. It provides novel insight into the molecular mechanisms driving hepatic metabolic memory, opening new avenues for developing therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control in obesity and metabolic disorders such as diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
The global rise in maternal obesity (MO) is closely linked to an increased predisposition to early-onset cardiovas- cular and metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, in offspring. Identifying early markers of dysfunction and disease in these individu- als is crucial for breaking the transgenerational cycle of disease. This study investigates how MO alters offspring aging trajectory predispos- ing to early cardiometabolic disease.

**Materials and methods:**
A Sprague-Dawley rat model of MO was induced by a high-fat/high-sugar diet from six weeks before gesta- tion until weaning. Offspring were maintained on a control diet, and plasma and heart samples were collected at 6, 16, and 32 weeks of age (controls=34; MO=32). Cardiac protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting, ATP levels by luminescence, oxidative stress markers by spectroscopy, and untargeted plasma composition screening by Fou- rier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with targeted validation via tandem mass spectrometry. Bioinformatic analysis was performed in Python. Two-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis, with p<0.05 considered significant.

**Results:**
MO dams exhibited increased gestational weight gain and impaired glucose metabolism (OGTT: p<0.01) before and during pregnancy. Offspring displayed sex-specific metabolic alterations, with FTIR spectroscopy revealing distinct age- and maternal diet-dependent plasma variations. MO males showed altered methyl-containing bio- molecules, while females exhibited increased lipid-related signals. Key metabolic markers such as glucose, leptin, and adiponectin were altered in the offspring’s plasma, with triglycerides exacerbated in MO females. MO males exhibited increased cardiac glucose-derived hexosamine biosynthetic pathway flux (O-GlcNAcylation, p<0.01), autophagy (p=0.03), and cardiac stiffness (YAP, p<0.01), whereas females displayed reduced O-GlcNAcylation (p=0.04), attenuated stiffness (p<0.01), and decreased autophagy (p=0.05). Mitochondrial ATP and NAD(P)H and total ATP levels were elevated in MO female offspring hearts (p<0.05), indicating metabolic changes, while oxida- tive stress markers diverged from age-matched controls, suggesting disrupted redox homeostasis.

**Conclusion:**
These findings demonstrate that MO disrupts offspring metabolic and cardiac aging trajectories, exacerbating diabetes-related vulnerabilities. FTIR-based blood screening emerges as a promising tool for the early detection of metabolic alterations, including those induced by MO. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing early prevention strategies to mitigate the intergenerational transmission of cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Bulk tissue and cell metabolomics strategies do not reveal the spatial characteristics of cell metabolism at the single cell level, and how these aspects relate to the location of cells and orga- nelles within the complexity of the tissue they reside within. Here we apply multi-scale microscopy, machine learning image segmentation, and spatial analysis tools to quantitatively map the fate of nutrient- derived C atoms across spatiotemporal scales in mouse hepatocytes in response to fasting and re-feeding.

**Materials and methods:**
We combined high-resolution analytical, microscopy, machine-learning (ML), and stable isotope labelling of mice (SILAM) using [U- C ]-glucose tracers. We measured the flux of glucose from whole body to the organelle level and its correlation with cellular and organelle organization. Central to our study is a multi- modal pipeline that combines the delivery of [U- C ]-glucose with traditional GC-MS, imaging MALDI spectrometry, and a correlated scanning electron microscopy with multi-isotope mass spectroscopy with machine learning (developed by us) to determine spatial flux pat- terns of glucose C at sub-cellular scales. (GC-MS) validated key findings at the bulk tissue level.

**Results:**
We investigated the spatial pattern of glucose-derived C flux in hepatocytes using overnight-fasted mice infused with 40 mg·kg ·min [U- C ]-glucose. Glycogen GC-MS validated our in vivo C labelling approach and confirmed a ~50% fractional enrichment of C in newly synthesized glycogen molecules. Next, we measured liver glycogen synthesis and C enrichment using MALDI- MS. This revealed that mice receiving a C-glucose-infusion had ~8x more new glycogen than fasted mice after 4 hours. Next, to determine the spatial fate and quantify the flux of C at the single cell level in hepatocytes, we applied MIMS-EM. This revealed time- and dose- dependent accumulation of glucose-derived C within the total hepato- cyte biomass, where C accumulation was granular andco-localized with glycogen stores located to the periphery of lipid droplets (LDs). Electron tomography experiments were done to discover that the LD scaffold acts as the site for glycogenesis reactions. We used ML to reconstruct the landscape of organelle interaction networks underlying this metabolic adaptation period. Hepatocyte organelle networks from glucose-infused mice were re-organized from ER- towards glycogen- centric contacts after re-feeding, thus revealing a significant shift in organelle connectivity during glycogenesis. These aspects are lost dur- ing obesity and diabetes.

**Conclusion:**
We demonstrate the use of large- and multi-scale approach to investigate spatial patterns of organelle organization and accumulation of glucose-derived C elements during fasting-fed states. We established that most mitochondria are randomly distributed within the subcellular space, and that only ER-contacting mitochondria are non-randomly organized - thus implying that processes involving mito- chondria-ER connections may occur in specific subcellular locations.

**Background and aims:**
Although bile acids (BAs) are recognised as pivotal signaling molecules that orchestrate energy and glucose homeo- stasis, the BA dynamics following a nutrient load in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is poorly characterised. This study evaluated the serum BA response to a 75g oral glucose load in Han Chinese with newly diag- nosed T2D compared to healthy controls, and the effects of 4-weeks insulin pump therapy.

**Materials and methods:**
Sixty-eight newly diagnosed, treatment- naïve Han Chinese T2D participants (43 male, age 49.7 ± 1.3 years, BMI 26.0 ± 0.4 kg/m , HbA1c 9.8 ± 0.2%) and 18 healthy controls (9 male, age 46.9 ± 2.7 years, BMI 23.8 ± 0.6 kg/m2) were enrolled. After an overnight fast, they underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Venous blood was sampled at t = 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes for measurements of plasma glucose and serum insulin, fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) and total and individual BAs (by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). A subset of T2D partici- pants (n = 21) received insulin pump therapy for four weeks when the OGTT was repeated.

**Results:**
Untreated T2D participants had comparable fasting serum total BA and FGF-19 levels to healthy controls, but exaggerated serum total BA and FGF-19 responses to oral glucose (group difference: P = 0.017 and 0.0002 respectively, Figure A). The area under the curve (AUC) for total BA between t = 0-180 min was related positively to both HOMA-IR (P < 0.05). Four weeks of insulin pump therapy mark- edly increased insulin secretion, and reduced HOMA-IR and glycaemia (both fasting and post-OGTT), accompanied by a reduction in total BAs, as well as reductions in specific species (TCA, TDCA, GCA, GCDCA and DCA) and FGF19 (each P < 0.05, Figure B).

**Conclusion:**
In newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve Han Chinese with poorly-controlled T2D, the serum BA response to an oral glucose load is increased, which is associated with insulin resistance and attenuated by insulin pump therapy. These observations are indicative of a close relationship between BAs and glucose metabolism.

**NLRP3 inhibition mitigates obesity-driven neuroinflammation and insulin resistance**

D. Basco, K. Piorkowska, C. Bazenet, A. Pfeifer, F. Capotosti, T. Seredenina

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, with hypothalamic inflammation playing a crucial role in its pathogenesis. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key mediator of inflammation, and its inhibition has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions. To further explore the role of hypothalamic inflammation, we evaluated the efficacy of the potent CNS-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor, ACI-19764, in a diet-induced obe- sity (DIO) mouse model.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks to induce obesity before initiation of a 4-week treatment with ACI-19764 (5 mg/kg twice a day, N=10 mice) or semaglutide (sema, 10 μg/kg; subcutaneous, N=8). In a follow- up study, ACI-19764 was co-administered with sema (n=10 mice). Body weight (BW) and composition (lean and fat mass) were assessed by Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry Analysis. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed 3 days before study termination, and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated from fasted blood glucose and plasma insulin levels. Hypo- thalamic neuroinflammation was evaluated by immunolabeling for the microglia marker Iba1 and the astrocytic marker GFAP. Plasma inflammatory (GFAP, cytokines) and metabolic biomarkers were measured at the end of the study. Data were analyzed using appropri- ate statistical methods, with significance at p<0.05.

**Results:**
Treatment with ACI-19764 led to a significant reduction in BW (-9.9% vs. vehicle; p<0.01) and fat mass (-10%; p<0.01), while notably preserving lean mass. These effects were similar to those of sema alone, while a combination of ACI-19764 with sema provided sig- nificant amelioration over monotherapies (-15.5% BW; p<0.05 sema and p<0.001 ACI-19764). Moreover, ACI-19764 effectively miti- gated hypothalamic inflammation, as indicated by a marked decrease in microglial (Iba1 -65%; p<0.001) and astrocytic (GFAP -56%; p<0.001) activation within the arcuate nucleus. This was corroborated by the reduction in GFAP (-45%; p=0.07) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (-39%; p<0.01) plasma levels. In addition to its anti-inflammatory effects, ACI-19764 enhanced metabolic health by improving insulin sensitiv- ity, as demonstrated by a 32% reduction in the AUC of the OGTT (p<0.01), a 50% decrease in HOMA-IR (p<0.001), and a 13% decrease in plasma cholesterol levels (p<0.05). Furthermore, it significantly improved glycemic control, lowering fasting blood glucose levels to 6.6 mmol/L 9.3 mmol/L in the vehicle group (p<0.0001). Notably, ACI-19764 reduced liver mass by 19%, suggesting a potential role in mitigating obesity-related hepatic complications.

**Conclusion:**
NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition with ACI-19764 effec- tively reduced BW, mitigated neuroinflammation in brain regions con- trolling food intake, and improved metabolic health in DIO mice. The significant attenuation of glial activation in the arcuate nucleus under- scores the critical role of neuroinflammation in obesity pathogenesis, highlights the importance of NLRP3 inhibition not only in periphery but also in CNS, and offers an efficacious approach to counteracting obesity-associated metabolic dysfunctions by amelioration of clinically relevant circulating biomarkers. Thus, targeting NLRP3 in the brain emerges as an innovative target for future therapies against obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a global health problem associated with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and co-morbid- ities such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and neurodegeneration. We identify pleiotrophin (PTN), a cytokine known for its role in tissue regeneration and energy metabolism, as a potential regulator of liver homeostasis. In addition, PTN plays a critical role in promoting neuroinflammation and the repair, survival, and differentiation of neurons in the central nervous system. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the role of PTN in liver dysfunction and the brain-periphery crosstalk in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model.

**Materials and methods:**
Three-month-old C57BL/6J wild-type ( ) and genetically deficient ( ) mice were fed with a standard chow diet or a HFD (60% kcal fat) for 6 months. In addition, the lipotoxicity-induced release of small extracellular vesicles (sEV) from primary and hepatocytes and their effects on the murine microglia BV2 cell line were investigated.

**Results:**
Our results show that deletion protects against body weight gain, meta-inflammation and HFD-induced MASLD and MASH development. Furthermore, it reveals the molecular mecha- nisms by which PTN may promote lipid synthesis and hepatic extra- cellular matrix remodelling in the liver. In addition, the study of sEV revealed that hepatocytes released more sEV under lipotoxic damage than . Interestingly, only the sEV from hepato- cytes under lipotoxic damage induced a proinflammatory phenotype in the BV2 cell line. This suggests that lipotoxic liver injury may trig- ger sEV-mediated neuroinflammation, whereas deletion protects against these effects.

**Conclusion:**
The findings on sEV highlight the relevance of PTN in the liver-brain crosstalk and its potential impact on metabolic and neu- rodegenerative disorders by providing a possible mechanism linking liver dysfunction to neuroinflammation.

**Central FGF19 action attenuates hypothalamic inflammation and improves leptin sensitivity in obese mice**

L. Zangerolamo

**Background and aims:**
Obesity has been linked to hypothalamic inflammation, which promotes resistance to the anorexigenic leptin sig- nal, impairing food behavior and energy expenditure (EE) regulation. Fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19) is an intestinal hormone that has gained attention as a potential therapeutic agent for metabolic dis- orders. Central FGF19 administration reduces food intake and body weight (BW) in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that FGF19 signaling in the hypothalamus attenuates neuroinflammation and improves leptin responsiveness, contributing to BW reduction in DIO mice.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL/6 Lean and DIO mice received a cannula into the lateral ventricle of the brain to enable 10 days of central FGF19 (3 μg/day) administration. An osmotic pump filled with FGF19 or vehicle was subcutaneously implanted and connected to the cannula via a catheter. Food intake and BW were monitored daily. EE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Hypothalamic TNF-α levels were measured by ELISA. Leptin sensitivity was assessed by JAK2/ STAT3 phosphorylation via Western blot in the hypothalamus and by measuring food intake over 24 h after a leptin load. Inflammatory mark- ers and neuropeptides were evaluated by qPCR. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and are presented as mean ± SEM. Differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05.

**Results:**
DIO mice treated with FGF19 displayed reduced hypotha- lamic TNF-α levels (pg/mg protein) (339.70 ± 21.41 Lean x 630.30 ± 104.00 DIO x 384.40 ± 46.21 DIO+FGF19), associated with dimin- ished hypothalamic inflammatory gene expression (TLR4: 2.38 ± 0.35 DIO x 1.11 ± 0.14 DIO+FGF19; IL-1β: 2.05 ± 0.34 DIO x 0.99 ± 0.23 DIO+FGF19, and Iba1: 1.34 ± 0.06 DIO x 0.74 ± 0.03 DIO+FGF19, fold change of Lean). The reduced neuroinflammation induced by FGF19 was accompanied by reduced BW gain (g) (0.18 ± 0.06 Lean x 3.64 ± 0.36 DIO x 1.31 ± 0.13 DIO+FGF19), lower food intake (kcal/day) (15.69 ± 0.61 Lean x 18.76 ± 0.86 DIO x 15.64 ± 0.45 DIO+FGF19), and abdominal adiposity (% BW) (0.51 ± 0.04 Lean x 4.50 ± 0.25 DIO x 3.09 ± 0.34 DIO+FGF19). Furthermore, central FGF19 administration improved EE (Kcal/h) over 24 h (1.13 ± 0.01 Lean x 1.04 ± 0.01 DIO x 1.15 ± 0.03 DIO+FGF19) without affect- ing locomotion (counts) (76465 ± 2732 Lean x 74590 ± 4590 DIO x 77279 ± 11355 DIO+FGF19). As food intake and EE are regulated by leptin, we assessed leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation levels were higher in DIO+FGF19 mice after a leptin bolus (p-JAK2: 0.36 ± 0.07 DIO x 0.99 ± 0.13 DIO+FGF19; p-STAT3: 0.62 ± 0.07 DIO x 0.98 ± 0.06 DIO+FGF19, fold change of Lean). Moreover, FGF19-treated mice ate less over 24 h after a leptin load (kcal) (13.90 ± 0.66 Lean x 17.47 ± 0.78 DIO x 14.72 ± 0.72 DIO+FGF19) and showed increased hypothalamic Leptin receptor expression (0.71 ± 0.04 DIO x 0.94 ± 0.07 DIO+FGF19, fold change of Lean), suggesting improved leptin sensitivity. Finally, we assessed the impact of improved hypothalamic leptin signaling on neuropeptides expression. FGF19 increased the expression of anorexigenic neuro- peptides without affecting orexigenic ones (POMC: 0.55 ± 0.08 DIO x 1.20 ± 0.16 DIO+FGF19, CART: 0.54 ± 0.06 DIO x 0.91 ± 0.10 DIO+FGF19; NPY: 0.77 ± 0.05 DIO x 0.78 ± 0.12 DIO+FGF19, and AgRP: 0.84 ± 0.05 DIO x 0.88 ± 0.16 DIO+FGF19, fold change of Lean).

**Conclusion:**
Central FGF19 delivery in the brain reduces hypotha- lamic inflammation, enhances leptin signaling, and promotes BW loss in obese mice.

**Background and aims:**
Hypothalamic inflammation (microgliosis) was tied to obesity-induced dysglycemia, but whether it reverses with dysglycemia upon weight loss is unclear. Furthermore, most studies considered rodents age-equivalent to young adults, but ignored mod- eling mid-aged humans. In this study, we aimed to assess how age influ- ences the reversal of obesity-induced dysglycemia and hypothalamic microgliosis following weight loss.

**Materials and methods:**
Young (7 weeks) or mid-aged (1 year) C57BL/6 mice were fed normal chow (NC) or a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. For obesity reversal, a subgroup of HFD-fed mice was switched back to NC for the final 2 weeks (weight loss group, WL). Mice were tested for dysglycemia 1 week into the dietary switch, and at the end of the 10-week intervention, hypothalamic inflammation was assessed by confocal microscopy, Imaris software analysis, bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing.

**Results:**
Following two weeks of dietary reversal, young and mid- aged WL mice lost 67.9% and 58.5% of their excess body weight, respectively, with full restoration of glycemic control (GTT). Hypothalamic bulk RNA-seq analysis revealed 2,419 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in mid-aged mice, 4 times more than in young mice. Interestingly, ~80% of DEGs in both age groups exhib- ited further aggravation of their expression change induced by obesity. Down-regulated genes were enriched (among others) in metabolic pathways (oxidative phosphorylation), thermogenesis, autophagy, and neurodegeneration. HFD induced typical microglial changes (increased numbers, larger cell volume) in the medio-basal hypothalamus, which were associated with increased nuclear p-NFkB staining. Remarkably, in mid-aged mice, only this obesity-induced activation was further aggravated in WL mice. Single-nucleus RNA- seq analysis identified microglia sub-populations whose proportions were largely responsive to WL.

**Conclusion:**
These findings reveal age-dependent response to weight loss: Unlike young mice, in mid-aged mice, normalization of obesity- induced dysglycemia upon weight loss may occur at the “expense” of augmented hypothalamic inflammation.

**Background and aims:**
The incidence of metabolic dysfunction- associated steatohepatitis (MASH) increases in patients with meta- bolic diseases with aging, driven by cumulative metabolic stress, chronic inflammation, and progressive liver fibrosis. Despite exten- sive research, limited efficacy of current therapies have prompted a search for novel therapeutic options. One of the possible exam- ples of novel approaches is the attenuation of cellular senescence, which contributes not only to the development of metabolic diseases like MASH, but also to the associated complications. Our goal was therefore to test the influence of mitochondria-targeted Tamoxifen (MitoTam), a potential anti-cancer agent with senolytic activity, on reduction of MASH and related pathologies across the different age groups.

**Materials and methods:**
We used male C57BL6 mice (n=10/group) of age of 4, 8, 12 and 16 months (m.) fed with high-fat diet (HFD) from the age of 5 weeks to induce different stages of prediabetes and MASH. The mice were treated intraperitoneally with MitoTam (2mg/ kg) dissolved in 4% EtOH in corn oil or with vehicle twice per week for four weeks. We studied the effects of MitoTam on metabolic parameters and development of MASH and its related complications. We used age-matched standard diet-fed mice as a control.

**Results:**
Compared to non-treated HFD mice, MitoTam significantly reduced body weight as well as white adipose tissue mass across all age groups. Significant decrease in fasting glucose and improved glucose absorption from blood was observed in 4, 8 and 12 months old animals. Glucose-lowering effect of MitoTam corresponded with improvement of metabolic-related hormones profile (e.g. insulin [ng/ ml]: 4m. 0.97±0.51 vs. 0.64±0.21 p=0.09; 8m. 2.75±1.19 vs. 0.8±0.43 p=0.001; 12m. 0.98±0.33 vs. 0.33±0.19 p<0.001; 16m. 1.68±0.85 vs. 0.90±0.35 p=0.04; or leptin [ng/ml]: 4m. 9.7±1.02 vs. 7.1±1.12 p<0.001; 8m. 8.4±3.02 vs. 4.8±1.44 p=0.008; 12m. 8.3±1.16 vs. 5.2±1.62 p<0.001; 16m. 7.9±1.03 vs. 6.1±1.41 p=0.02). These met- abolic changes were accompanied by reduced lipid accumulation in liver (balloons [%]: 4m. 22.1±6.8 vs. 12.1±6.1 p=0.06; 8m. 23.5±11.9 vs. 10.3±1.9 p=0.04; 12m. 34.4±8.7 vs. 11.1±7.3 p=0.003; 16m. 20.7±2.0 vs. 20.6±1.7 p=0,94) correlating with decreased presence of senescent cells across the age groups. Lower senescent cell burden in liver after MitoTam treatment corresponded to decrease of inflam- matory markers, liver damage and reduced liver fibrosis. Reduction of fibrosis, inflammation as well as reduced lipid deposition in the liver led to prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma occurring in mice with long-term untreated MASH (average incidence of cancerous lesions in the liver of 16m. old mice [n]: 16.4±20.4 vs. 0.25±0.4).

**Conclusion:**
In summary, our data suggest that targeting senescence with MitoTam may represent a novel approach to the treatment of MASH and its related complications promising a complex impact on senescence-related pathologies in aging population of patients with metabolic diseases.

**Background and aims:**
Chronic brain leptin signalling deficiency in mature male adult rats is sufficient to induce whole-body insulin resistance, hepatic glucagon resistance, and hyperglucagonemia, key markers commonly associated with pre-diabetes or early-onset of Type II Diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of induced central leptin resistance on the inflammatory state and the develop- ment of fibrosis in liver tissue, as well as structural changes in the pancreas.

**Materials and methods:**
To induce a state of chronic brain lep- tin signalling deficiency, three-month-old male normoleptinemic Wistar rats were infused intracerebroventricularly either with a rat-specific Superactive Leptin Antagonist (SLA) (0.2 μg/day) or with saline (PBS). After 21 days of chronic treatment, overnight fasted rats were euthanized. Their liver was weighed and stored at -80ºC until use. On the other hand, both the liver and pancreas were fixed in 10% neutral buffer formalin for immunohis- tochemistry analysis.

**Results:**
Herein, we demonstrate that a deficit in central leptin sig- nalling modifies the expression of genes encoding key enzymes and transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism in the liver, leading to hepatic triacylglycerides (TAG) accumulation. We also observed an increase in gene expression of proinflammatory mark- ers Il-1β and CCL5, as well as increased NF-κB protein and mac- rophage content in the liver. These findings support that excessive lipid accumulation in the liver predisposes to the onset and progres- sion of inflammation. Moreover, we found the upregulation of the glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1) and proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) after SLA treatment. The proliferation and activation of HSCs after liver inflammation can, over time, lead to an increase in extracellular matrix production, which may result in the development of liver fibrosis. Masson’s trichrome staining demonstrated a marked rise in Collagen type I deposition in the perivascular area in SLA treated animals, which represents an early state in the development of liver fibrosis. Pancreatic histological studies revealed increased infiltration of adipocytes and presence of lipid droplets in the acinar tissue, along with macrophage infiltra- tion and increased collagen type I presence, indicating inflamma- tion and fibrosis in the pancreas of rats with reduced brain leptin signalling

**Conclusion:**
Taken together, our results suggest that the lack of cen- tral leptin signalling generates changes in both the liver and pancreas, leading to inflammation and fibrosis, which could finally impair liver sensitivity to glucagon and insulin as well as disrupt intrapancreatic regulation of hormone secretion and islet remodelling.

**Spatial patterns in the loss of neurometabolic feedback and neu- rogenic potential in obesity**

D.L. Cline

**Background and aims:**
Leptin resistance contributes to the develop- ment of obesity and type 2 diabetes by promoting weight gain and increasing blood glucose. Alleviating leptin resistance is therefore a key target for weight loss therapeutics. Physiological studies suggest that leptin resistance is caused by excess circulating leptin levels. Efforts to characterize this phenomenon in the brain’s leptin-targeted appetite neurons used RNA sequencing, which lacks spatial resolu- tion. Since appetite neurons’ organization within circumventricular organs may be dictated by nutrient and leptin diffusion gradients, a spatial approach is needed to understand their contribution to the leptin-resistant phenotype. We therefore sought to uncover the tran- scriptomic changes driving leptin resistance in a spatial context, to understand how this impairs appetite neuron organization across hormonal and nutritional gradients.

**Materials and methods:**
Mice were fed high-fat diet for 8 weeks to generate a model of leptin resistance in obesity. We used single-cell spatial transcriptomics to identify transcriptionally disrupted cell types in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, which are key brain regions involved in appetite and metabolism. This provided spatially- defined cellular markers of leptin resistance. We then hypothesized that transcriptomic profiles across nutritional gradients could be rescued in a leptin sensitive state. To test this, used multiplexed RNA in situ hybridization in hypothalamic appetite neurons from mice that were genetically protected against leptin resistance and then fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks.

**Results:**
Our results showed that the hippocampus and hypothala- mus, but not basolateral amygdala, displayed reduced expression of mRNAs encoding neurogenesis ( ), in obesity. Contrary to our expectations, we saw no change in synaptogenesis mRNAs ( ). All three brain regions showed reduced expression of neurometabolic receptors ( and ) and increased expression of their negative feedback mechanisms ( and ) in obesity. This result was most pronounced in hypothalamic neurons proximal to the median eminence, where exposure to maladaptive levels of leptin in obesity is thought to be highest. These changes were reversed in mice protected from leptin resistance.

**Conclusion:**
We identified subregions of transcriptomic dysregulation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus as well as the arcuate and ven- tromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, which is indicative of selective leptin resistance. We hope that understanding these hotspots of leptin resistance in the context of the brain’s nutritional and hormonal gra- dients will help inform new therapeutic strategies for the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
The antioncogene TP53 coding for p53 was associated with T2D and obesity, inducing insulin resistance by upreg- ulating NF-κB signaling in monocytes/macrophages and amplifying pro-inflammatory cytokine release (e.g., TNF-α). Recently, persistence of “lipid-associated macrophages” in adipose tissue which sustained inflammation despite weight loss was shown to be p53 dependent. We analyzed the network of TP53 by RNAseq in human monocytes upon dietary weight loss of 15 kg in patients with T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
52 obese non-insulin-dependent T2D patients consumed formula diets (600 / 800 kcal/day for females/males) for 12 weeks. Study days before and after 12 weeks included anthropom- etry, meal tests, clinical chemistry, CD14+-monocyte isolation and RNAseq.

**Results:**
Body weight decreased by 15% (BMI w0 = 36.0±5.6 kg/m²; w12 =32.1±4.5 kg/m², p<0.001) and HbA1c decreased from 7.6% to 6.5% indicating diabetes remission (HbA1c<6.5%) due to improved insulin sensitivity and secretion. Transcriptomic WGCNA identified TP53 as an important Hub gene and transcription factor (TF) which was upregulated. Up-regulated genes involved many mitochondrial, ribosomal and DNA-repair genes while TNF- and NFkB-pathways related to chronic inflammation were downregulated which involved reduced expression of the AP1-complex TFs JUN and FOS. By con- trast, IRF3 and IRF7, together with IKBKE were upregulated improv- ing viral defense together with enhanced imiquimod-induced TLR7 ex vivo cytokine and chemokine responses in blood cells. Compo- nents of the electron transfer chain and ATP-synthase were mostly upregulated while a complex reorganization of mitochondrial nuclear encoded and ribosomal genes was seen. TP53 was increased by reduced MDM2 ubiquitin ligase expression involving, RPL5 and RPL28 and further pathways. TP53 also suppressed ATF4 via RPL41, a primary TF of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). We observed an elabo- rate restructuring of antioxidative genes and chaperonins and of the ubiquitin-proteasome system involved in cellular proteostasis, which may reflect the improved mitochondrial function and reduced ROS production upon metabolic improvements.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, we observe a protective role of p53 in human monocytes upon weight loss contrasting with previous data. Inflam- matory gene expression shifted from a chronic inflammation pattern to a greatly reduced inflammatory profile. Extensive mitochondrial reorganization indicating improved oxidative function may underlie the metabolic benefits. Upregulation of the TP53 was a predominant TF determining these responses.

**Adipose tissue inflammation and disproportionate visceral adipos- ity as potential drivers of insulin resistance in south Asian women with prior gestational diabetes**

S. Lee-Ødegård

**Background and aims:**
Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (pGDM) are at elevated risk for developing type 2 diabetes, particularly those of South Asian origin living in Western countries. We aimed to explore how fat distribution and adipose tissue inflam- mation relate to insulin resistance in South Asian and Nordic women with and without pGDM.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted detailed phenotyping includ- ing CT-based quantification of fat depots and liver fat, a two-step hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (“low insulin” 10 and “high insulin” 40 mU/m²/min) with [6,6-²H ] glucose tracer, subcutaneous adipose tissue mRNA sequencing, and plasma proteomics in 19 South Asian and 16 Nordic women with pGDM, and 16 ethnicity-matched controls.

**Results:**
Subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue, and particularly the VAT/SAT ratio, were elevated in pGDM participants versus controls. A metabolic risk gradient was observed: South Asian women with pGDM had the most adverse profile, followed by Nor- dic women with pGDM, South Asian controls, and Nordic controls. Insulin sensitivity was inversely associated with VAT and liver fat. Notably, the association between liver fat and insulin resistance varied by VAT levels: among women with low VAT, liver fat was not associ- ated with insulin sensitivity, whereas in those with high VAT, liver fat was strongly and inversely associated (interaction p < 0.01). The liver fat-to-VAT ratio was lowest in South Asian women with pGDM and increased progressively across the other groups.Adipose tissue transcriptomics identified inflammation-related pathways and reduced mitochondrial gene expression in association with lower insulin sensi- tivity. The circulating inflammatory protein PSAP, which mirrored adi- pose mRNA expression, was elevated in pGDM and statistically accounted for part of the association between the liver fat-to-VAT ratio and insulin sensitivity. These findings were consistent across several external cohorts.

**Conclusion:**
In this well-characterized but relatively small cohort, we observed that adipose tissue inflammation and a disproportionately high accumulation of visceral fat were associated with insulin resist- ance, particularly in South Asian women with prior GDM. The liver fat-to-VAT ratio appeared to be a strong correlate of insulin sensitiv- ity, potentially reflecting a mechanism in which VAT amplifies the metabolic consequences of liver fat — possibly mediated in part by circulating factors such as PSAP. Further studies are needed to confirm these observations and clarify underlying mechanisms.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a global metabolic disorder, with susceptibility increasing with age. Aging elevates body fat, disrupting glucose homeostasis and contributing to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, obesity affects the liver, causing fatty liver and inflammation. Hyperactivated macrophages in obesity release inflam- matory mediators, accelerating fatty liver progression. This study examines the effects of ASC (Active Single Compound)1 and ASC2 on obesity-induced metabolic disorders using an aging obesity mouse model induced by a high-fat diet (HFD).

**Materials and methods:**
34-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a chow diet (ND, 11.5 kcal% fat, n=6) or an HFD (40 kcal% fat, n=6) for 13 weeks. The ASC1 and ASC2 groups received daily oral admin- istration of ASC1 (5 mg/kg, n=6) or ASC2 (5 mg/kg, n=6) with the HFD. Body weight was measured weekly. Fasting blood glucose levels were measured every 4 weeks. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed in 12th week. Plasma GOT, GPT, insulin, glucagon, and glucose levels were measured after sacrifice. Liver tissue was conducted using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson’s trichrome staining. Hepatic lipids were extracted to quantify triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (CHOL) levels. Western blot analysis was conducted in liver. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using RNA sequencing (n=4 / group), and visualized through a heatmap.

**Results:**
From week 10, the ASC1 and ASC2 groups exhibited sig- nificantly less body weight gain compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05) and maintained this difference until the end of the experiment. Liver weight and extent of liver fibrosis were also reduced (p < 0.05). Hepatic TG levels decreased in ASC1 (p < 0.05), and CHOL levels decreased in both groups (p < 0.05). Furthermore, plasma GOT and GPT were significantly lower in the experimental groups compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05). Fasting blood glucose measurements showed that the ASC1 and ASC2 groups had significantly lower levels than the HFD group starting at week 8 (p < 0.05). By week 12, the difference between the experimental and control groups became even more pronounced (ASC1, p < 0.001; ASC2, p < 0.01). Additionally, results of plasma glucose level, IPGTT, and AUC were reduced in both ASC1 and 2 compared to the HFD group. Plasma insulin levels were significantly reduced in the ASC1 group compared to the control group (p < 0.01). These results indicated that both ASC1 and 2 improved glucose metabolism than HFD group. The hepatic protein expressions of Lipocalin-2 and p-p38 were reduced in the ASC2 group compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05). Moreover, heatmap analysis revealed reduced expression of inflammation-related genes associated with mac- rophage activation in both experimental groups.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates that ASC1 and ASC2 effec- tively alleviate obesity-induced metabolic disorders in an aging obe- sity mouse. Both compounds reduced body and liver weight, hepatic TG, CHOL levels, and fibrosis while improving glucose metabolism. Additionally, they attenuated hepatic inflammation by suppressing inflammation-related proteins and macrophage activation genes. These results highlight ASC1 and ASC2 as promising therapeutic agents for managing obesity, type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver in aging.

**Background and aims:**
Despite obesity being a key risk factor for dia- betes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, about 30% of individuals with obesity remain metabolically healthy. This study investigates the under- lying mechanisms, focusing on the role of inflammatory resolution pathways in determining susceptibility to cardiometabolic diseases.

**Materials and methods:**
Lean (L) individuals and ones with obesity (O) were categorized as metabolically healthy (MH) or metabolically unhealthy (MU). Biological samples were analyzed using flow cytom- etry and Olink’s Proximity Extension Assay for proteomic profiling. An inflammatory "blister model" was utilized to study immune responses over time by sampling fluid and cells from induced blisters.

**Results:**
Individuals with obesity exhibited higher systemic low-grade inflammation, as indicated by elevated CRP levels compared to leans (MHL vs. MHO; MHL vs. MUO; MUL vs. MHO; and MUL vs. MUO, all p < 0.0005). MUO individuals had significantly greater leukocytes (MHL vs. MUO, p = 0.04) and neutrophils (MHL vs. MUO, p = 0.005) compared to MHL participants. Proteomic analyses of plasma and blis- ter fluid revealed differences between metabolic phenotype groups. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that the proteins uPA, CX3CL1, and TNFSF14 in plasma, along with IL-8, EN-RAGE, and CXCL5 in blisters, were the primary contributors to the differences observed between the groups.

**Conclusion:**
This study underscores the role of inflammation and its resolution in cardiometabolic health and disease. It also identifies a bio- marker profile that may help distinguish cardiometabolic phenotypes.

**Background and aims:**
Adipose tissue fibrosis, excessive extracellular matrix deposition, impairs adipocyte function and promotes metabolic dysfunction. Previous studies report increased fibrosis in obesity, but with depot-specific differences. Endotrophin, a byproduct of collagen VI (COL6A3), is up-regulated in obesity and T2D is linked to sys- temic insulin resistance, but direct effect on adipocyte glucose uptake remains unclear. This study aimed to (1) compare fibrosis in subcutane- ous (SAT) and omental (OAT) adipose tissue from obese and non-obese individuals, (2) assess the relationship between collagen expression and metabolic markers, and (3) determine the impact of endotrophin on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes.

**Materials and methods:**
SAT and OAT samples were obtained from obese (n=15, BMI: 31.0-52.9 kg/m²) and non-obese (n=36, BMI: 20.0-29.9 kg/m²) subjects during kidney donation or bariatric surgery. Fibrosis area (%) was measured using Picrosirius Red staining. Gene expression of collagens were measured with RNAseq (n=30). Isolated adipocytes were used to measure cell size, and treated with or without recombinant endotrophin (500 ng/mL) for 3h to evaluate its effect on glucose uptake.

**Results:**
Fibrosis was significantly elevated in SAT from obese indi- viduals compared to lean and overweight subjects by about 2-fold (p<0.05). In contrast, OAT fibrosis did not differ between the groups. Higher SAT fibrosis correlated positively with several markers of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance (fasting glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, C-peptide, p<0.05) and BMI (p=0.08), but no significant associations with clinical parameters were found for OAT. In multi- variate regression (model: HOMA-IR, sex and BMI), only HOMA-IR (stdβ =0.32, p<0.05) was a significant predictor of fibrosis % in SAT (p<0.05, adjusted R2 = 0.11). Higher fibrosis area (%) in SAT was positively associated (rho=0.51, p<0.01) with higher adipocyte size in OAT. Gene expression of several collagens in SAT (e.g. ) is negatively associated with age, but no significant associa- tions were found with BMI, HOMA-IR and fibrosis %. Interestingly, in OAT a negative association was found between , and mRNA and body fat% (p<0.05). Endotrophin treat- ment reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes (both 25 and 1000 μU/mL) by about 20%, p<0.05, compared to controls.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings indicate that fibrosis is elevated in SAT, but not in OAT, among individuals with obesity. Increased SAT fibrosis correlates with insulin resistance and larger omental adipocytes, sug- gesting enhanced fat storage in central depots. The observed mismatch between the degree of fibrosis and collagen mRNA levels suggests that the fibrotic remodeling is an established condition rather than an active, ongoing process. Furthermore, endotrophin exposure reduces insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, highlighting a potential mechanistic link to metabolic dysfunction.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes and obesity are closely linked, with adipose tissue expansion and fibrosis associated with lipotoxicity and the onset of metabolic consequences of visceral adiposity. Tradi- tional assessments of these conditions often rely on anthropometric measures and indirect indicators, which do not explore the pathological changes within adipose tissue in clinical practice. This study evaluates the integration of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) biopsies into rou- tine clinical assessments for patients with obesity, focusing particularly on tissue fibrosis and the presence of type 2 diabetes along with other cardiometabolic characteristics. This approach supports the hypothesis that SAT histology could complement existing methods to better char- acterize patients with obesity and diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Abdominal SAT samples were collected without any adverse event from 50 patients with obesity during their initial visit to an Obesity Unit in 2024. Adipose tissue fibrosis was assessed by the pathology department using the FATscore, a semi- quantitative index introduced in 2017, which accounts for perilobular and pericellular fibrosis. Clinical parameters were extracted from par- ticipants’ medical records. Cross-sectional analysis was used to evalu- ate variables associated with adipose fibrosis, using Chi-square tests, Wilcoxon tests, or Spearman correlation coefficients as appropriate.

**Results:**
No significant differences in age or BMI were observed between patients with and without adipose fibrosis. Fibrosis was present in the abdominal SAT of 10 patients (20%). The presence of fibrosis in adipose tissue was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (50% in patients with vs. 15% in patients without fibrosis; p-value = 0.017). Additionally, partici- pants with adipose fibrosis showed increased indices associated with liver fibrosis (FIB-4: 1.30±0.73 vs. 0.75±0.28, p-value=0.043; APRI score: 0.41±0.23 vs. 0.22±0.08, p-value=0.027), lower platelet counts (241,500 vs 305,550, p-value=0.025), and lower LDL cholesterol lev- els (102.7±22.1 vs. 127.3±31.0, p-value=0.023).

**Conclusion:**
Fibrosis of subcutaneous adipose tissue may identify patients with obesity who have developed type 2 diabetes and are at a higher risk of liver fibrosis. Incorporating SAT fibrosis assessments into routine clinical practice could provide a valuable biomarker for stratifying disease severity and guiding tailored interventions. Further studies are needed to fully understand the clinical implications of SAT fibrosis in individuals with obesity and diabetes.

**Exploration of glucose metabolism in adipose tissue-specific dia- cylglycerol kinase delta knock-out mice**

M. Jollet, D. Santiago Guimarães, J. Ortiz de ­Zevallos, D. Rizo-, Roca, M. Björnholm, A. ­Krook, J.R. ­Zierath

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive meta- bolic disorder resulting from genetic and environmental factors that impair insulin secretion and action in peripheral tissues. Our previous research identified reduced diacylglycerol kinase delta (DGKδ) expres- sion and DGK activity in skeletal muscle from individuals with type 2 diabetes. In mice models, we demonstrated that reducing DGKδ activ- ity through genetic ablation of the enzyme (DGKδ haplo-insufficient) leads to aberrant insulin signalling, impaired whole-body insulin sensi- tivity, including reduced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and age-dependent obesity. Since glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue accounts for the majority of peripheral glu- cose disposal, we generated adipose tissue-specific DGKδ knock-out mice (KO) to elucidate the tissue-specific contribution of DGKδ to systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.

**Materials and methods:**
We investigated the consequences of adipose tissue-specific DGKδ knock-out on whole body glucose metabolism in 3-5 months-old male and female mice using means of magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI), intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (ipGTT; 2g/kg lean mass), euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (5 mU/min/kg of insulin), and gene expression (Mfatp1, Fas, Cd1, Cpt1, Mcad) and protein abundance (ATGL, DGAT, PKC substrates, and phospho-pan- PKC) in epidydimal and brown adipose tissues.

**Results:**
MRI-based body composition analysis revealed comparable lean (males: 28.4±1.5 vs 28.9±1.7; females: 21.3±2.1 vs 22.0±1.8) and fat mass (males: 5.4±2.4 vs 5.4±1.3; females: 3.9±1.9 vs 4.8±3.8) between KO and wild-type (WT) littermates within each sex. Glucose tolerance was unaltered between genotypes. Additionally. the glucose clamp assay indicated similar glucose infusion rate (males: 33.2±5.6 vs 42.9±17.8; females: 63.0±15.0 vs 52.9±5.4). Gene expression analy- sis of fatty acid metabolism markers (mfatp1, fas, cd1, cpt1, mcad) in white and brown adipose tissue showed no significant differences between KO and WT animals. However, the primary component of triglycerides hydrolysis into fatty acid (ATGL) exhibited a significant reduction (p<0.05) in adipose tissue-specific DGKδ KO mice, specifi- cally in brown adipose tissue.

**Conclusion:**
Despite the downregulation of DGKδ in its primary site of expression, adipose tissue, our findings suggest other organs, most likely the skeletal muscle, as the key site for DGKδ-mediated metabolic regulation. Further investigations under metabolic stress conditions, including high-fat diet, are warranted to elucidate the potential role of adipose tissue-specific DGKδ expression in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine with a dual role in metabolism and inflammation. While traditionally associated with chronic low-grade inflammation in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), IL-6 also plays a context-dependent role in glucose and lipid metabolism. Elevated IL-6 levels are associated with insulin resist- ance, but IL-6 can also enhance lipolysis and energy expenditure under certain conditions. The effects of IL-6 are mediated by the gp130 signaling pathway, which varies in different tissues. Understanding how IL-6 signaling in adipose tissue affects metabolic homeostasis is crucial to unravelling its role in the pathophysiology of diabetes. To better understand the effects of IL-6 signaling on adipose tissue, we developed a constitutively active glycoprotein 130 (gp130) receptor by dimerising two gp130 proteins with a leucine zipper (Lgp130). This synthetic receptor complex was selectively expressed in adipocytes by breeding with adiponectin-Cre mice. To evaluate its effects, we compared transgenic and wild-type mice under standard and high-fat diet conditions over 18 weeks. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of adipocyte-specific Lgp130 expression on metabolic traits associated with diabetes, including body weight, inflammation, glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity

**Materials and methods:**
Body composition was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Glucose tolerance (GTT) and insulin tol- erance tests (ITT) were performed to analyze diabetic parameters. In addition, nutrient preference, energy expenditure and food intake were determined by indirect calorimetry. The mice were fed with the respec- tive diets for 18 weeks (4-22 week of life). analysis included qPCR, histology, 3 RNA sequencing, FACS and ELISA. Transgenic Lgp130-fl-Adiponectin-Cre mice were compared with wildtype CB57BL/6J mice on either high-fat,- or standard diet, with a group size of at least (n=8)

**Results:**
Lgp130 adiponectin Cre-positive mice showed a significant reduction in fat mass under both standard and high-fat diet conditions, while muscle mass remained largely unchanged. On a high-fat diet, Ucp1 (uncoupling protein 1) expression was significantly increased, leading to enhanced thermogenesis and accompanied by a reduction in brown adipose tissue. Glucose tolerance remained unaffected, but insulin sensitivity was slightly reduced under high-fat diet conditions. No differences in lipolysis were observed between wild-type and trans- genic mice. In addition, increased browning of white adipose tissue was detected by qPCR analysis of browning. Furthermore, there were no changes in immune cell populations, suggesting that Lgp130 does not have pro-inflammatory signaling effects in adipose tissue

**Conclusion:**
Our findings highlight the role of IL-6 signaling in adi- pocytes, regulating energy metabolism, with potential implications for metabolic disease research. Importantly, we did not observe a signifi- cant effect on inflammation, challenging the conventional view that IL-6 signaling is detrimental in metabolic disorders. These findings suggest that IL-6 signaling in adipocytes may have beneficial metabolic effects and is more nuanced than previously thought, highlighting its potential role in adipose tissue plasticity and energy homeostasis

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is related to a decreased brown adi- pose tissue (BAT) metabolic activity in humans, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Current models widely used to investigate human BAT regulation, such as murine and 2D adi- pose cell cultures, are far from replicating the real human envi- ronment. Therefore, new and more sophisticated models that more closely reflect the environment are needed. We have devel- oped a brown adipose 3D spheroid model from human adipose progeni- tor cells to meet this experimental need with the aim of studying the mechanisms behind BAT function.

**Materials and methods:**
To generate this model, supraclavicular BAT was excised from healthy active winter swimmers (where BAT was expected to be highly metabolically active) by a surgical procedure under local anesthesia. The procedure was anatomically guided with images obtained with positron emission tomography and computed tomography. BAT was digested and the stromal vascular cell fraction was isolated, proliferated in 2D and transferred to ultra-low attachment plates for 3D spheroid development. Spheroids were then differentiated into brown adipose spheroids by incubating them with a differentiation cocktail for 14 days. To assess the accuracy and functionality of our 3D spheroid model, we investigated differentiation markers, thermo- genic properties, lipid formation, lipolytic activity and mitochondrial respiration using fluorescence microscopy, qPCR, lipolysis assays and microplate respirometry. These measurements were compared with 2D brown adipocytes and 3D white adipose spheroids.

**Results:**
Our results show that our primary human brown adipose spheroid model accumulates lipids acquiring a multilocular appear- ance when differentiated, and that it has a higher expression of ther- mogenic genes (e.g., UCP1 and CIDEA), is more lipolytic (higher glycerol release when stimulated) and has a higher UCP-1 dependent mitochondrial respiration in comparison to primary human white adi- pose spheroids.

**Conclusion:**
Our 3D spheroid model serves as a novel tool for metabolic research in the fields of drug discovery and personalized medicine.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a global health issue closely linked to diabetes. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a crucial role in non- shivering thermogenesis, a mitochondria-driven process that regulates energy expenditure and metabolic health. Cold exposure stimulates BAT thermogenesis, providing an opportunity to explore its regulatory mechanisms. This study investigates the role of activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) in thermogenesis and adipocyte differentiation under mitochondrial stress and cold exposure. Additionally, we examine the signaling pathways through which ATF5 modulates UCP1 expression, providing novel insights into BAT thermogenesis regulation.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL/6 mice (6 weeks old) were exposed to 4°C, and BAT was collected for qPCR analysis. Brown adipocytes were cultured for 7 days, and gene expression was assessed by qPCR and protein levels by Western blotting. ATF5 expression was inhibited using si , and metabolic changes were analyzed. Mito- chondrial function was assessed by measuring the oxygen consump- tion rate (OCR) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) flux. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed post- knockdown to analyze differen- tially expressed genes. Using biosensors targeted to either the nucleus or cytosol, we measured compartment-specific ERK1/2 activity in HEK293T cells expressing a FRET reporter

**Results:**
Cold exposure and β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL-316,243 significantly increased ATF5 expression in BAT and differentiated brown adipocytes, accompanied by elevated thermogenic gene expres- sion. ATF5 regulates thermogenesis via PKA and ERK signaling, with ERK phosphorylation playing a key role in UCP1 induction. ATF5 also upregulates lipolysis- and UPRmt-related proteins during adipo- cyte differentiation. knockdown impaired mitochondrial function, reducing UPRmt gene expression, OCR, and FAO-derived citrate flux after palmitate treatment. RNA-Seq analysis confirmed ATF5’s role in regulating fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and thermogenesis. Inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) reduced ATF5 expression in brown adipocytes and BAT. Biosensor experiments revealed that CL-316,243 treatment selectively increased nuclear ERK1/2 activity without altering cytosolic signaling, sug- gesting nuclear ERK1/2 plays a crucial role in ATF5-mediated UCP1 induction.

**Conclusion:**
Acute cold exposure induces ATF5 expression in BAT, which is essential for adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis. ATF5 depletion impairs mitochondrial function and FAO metabolism. Notably, nuclear ERK1/2 signaling mediates UCP1 induction, sug- gesting a novel pathway distinct from PKA. These findings establish ATF5 as a key regulator of thermogenesis and metabolism, offering a potential therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes treatment.

**Background and aims:**
Brown adipocytes, the principal effectors of brown adipose tissue (BAT), function within highly coordinated signaling cascades that govern thermogenic responses. The LATS kinases, components of the Hippo signaling pathway, exert regu- latory control over downstream effectors such as YAP1 and TAZ, thereby modulating cellular proliferation and differentiation. While emerging data suggest a role for YAP1 and TAZ in BAT physiol- ogy, the specific involvement of LATS kinases in the regulation of non-shivering thermogenesis remains insufficiently characterized. The present study seeks to define the contribution of LATS kinases to the regulation of brown adipocyte function and thermogenic competence.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate the role of LATS kinases in brown adipocyte physiology, we performed siRNA-mediated silenc- ing of , , and a combined knockdown of and in immortalized murine brown adipocytes. Functional consequences of gene silencing were evaluated by analysing alterations in the expression of general and brown adipocyte-specific marker genes, UCP1 protein abundance, lipolytic activity, lipid droplet content, and mitochondrial respiratory capacity. To confirm the physiological significance of LATS kinases , we generated inducible, brown adipocyte-spe- cific / double knockout mice ( x x - CreERT2). Using this model, we assessed the effects of LATS kinase ablation on BAT thermogenic function, thermogenic gene expression, and systemic energy homeostasis. Additionally, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying -mediated regulation in adipocytes.

**Results:**
Knockdown of as well as combined silencing of and resulted in a marked downregulation of brown adipocyte-specific gene marker expression, reduced UCP1 protein abundance, attenuated phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase, and compromised mitochondrial respiratory function (p<0.05). In contrast, knockdown alone did not elicit any detectable effects. Consistent with these findings, inducible deletion of / in brown adipocytes led to a significant reduction in interscapu- lar BAT mass and decreased protein levels of UCP1 and ATGL in mice acclimated to cold, accompanied by a notable decline in whole- body energy expenditure (p<0.05). Mechanistically, we observed that / knockdown promotes stabilization and nuclear trans- location of TAZ, which directly interacts with PPARg and act as its co-repressor.

**Conclusion:**
These findings highlight the essential role of LATS kinases, especially LATS2, in the regulation of brown adipocyte func- tionality and non-shivering thermogenesis, providing novel mechanistic insights into the control of systemic energy metabolism.

**Background and aims:**
Pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-acti- vated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist, is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes due to its ability to improve insulin sensitivity and modulate lipid metabolism. The effects of pioglitazone on brown adi- pose tissue (BAT) were not very well characterized. BAT is related to non-shivering thermogenesis, a process that increase energy expendi- ture and glucose and fatty acids uptake by cells.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with either water (control) or pioglitazone (30 mg/kg/day, PO) for 15 days. At the end of treatment, animals were used for indirect calorimetry ( , Sable Systems®). Then, mice were euthanized and interscapular BAT (iBAT) was dissected and used for mass evaluation, histology, gene expression (CD36, FATP1, PPARγ, Leptin, CIDEA and UCP1) and protein expression of the main protein related to non-shivering thermogenesis uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Statistical analyses were performed by Student t-test (P < 0.05), with n = 5 per group. CD36 = platelet glycoprotein 4; FATP1 = long-chain fatty acid transport protein 1; CIDEA = lipid transferase CIDEA.

**Results:**
Indirect calorimetry showed an increase in oxygen consump- tion ­(VO , ) and heat production ( ) of animals treated with pioglitazone in relation to control group. The mass of iBAT was increased by pioglitazone treatment ( ). The treatment with pioglitazone also promoted lipid accumulation in the interscapular BAT, increasing the percentage of unilocular adipocytes ( ) in this tissue that is mostly multilocular. A reduction on the number of cells per field ( ) was also observed, suggesting an increase in adipocyte size. Gene expression analysis indicated PPARγ activation ( ), regulation of lipid stores (Leptin, ), and enhanced lipid uptake by CD36 ( ). CIDEA, a gene involved in lipid storage modulation, lipid droplet fusion, and considered a thermogenic marker, was also increased in the pioglitazone group ( ). How- ever, no modulation in the gene and protein expression of UCP1 was observed.

**Conclusion:**
Pioglitazone significantly influenced lipid metabolism in BAT, increasing lipid droplet size and total mass, while also enhancing fatty acid uptake through upregulation of CD36 and leptin gene expres- sion. Additionally, the treatment elevated oxygen consumption and heat production of mice, suggesting a rise in energy expenditure. However, despite these metabolic changes, pioglitazone did not directly modulate UCP1 expression, indicating that its effects on thermogenesis may be indirect or require additional pathways. These findings highlight piogl- itazone’s role in BAT lipid metabolism and energy balance, offering insights into its broader metabolic effects beyond insulin sensitization.

**Background and aims:**
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) contributes to non-shivering thermogenesis but is often impaired in individuals with obesity. Repeated cold exposure, or cold acclimation, can enhance BAT metabolism. Previously, we observed that acute cold exposure stimulates systemic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ­(NAD ) bioreg- ulatory pathways to support BAT metabolism. Given the emerging roles of ­NAD metabolism and cold therapy in improving insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function, we investigated whether cold acclimation increases circulatory ­NAD levels in individuals with obesity and explored the relationship between BAT metabolism and ­NAD dynamics.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied 10 healthy adults with obesity (BMI: 36.8 ± 6.7 kg/m , Age: 34.4 ± 5.3 years, HOMA-IR: 3.98 ± 2.44, 3 M/7 F) who underwent a supervised cold-acclimation protocol involving regular cold-water immersions (30-60 min/session, 2 times/ week) at 18°C. To measure BAT glucose uptake, F-FDG PET-CT imaging was used under an acute cold stimulation to stimulate BAT metabolism maximally. Circulatory ­NAD , NADH and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) levels were analyzed from whole blood sam- ples collected at room temperature before and after the cold-acclima- tion period.

**Results:**
Cold acclimation did not significantly increase circulatory ­NAD levels across all participants ( p-value = 0.976); nor did it signifi- cantly affect NADH levels or the NAD+/NADH ratio (p = 0.36 and p = 0.32, respectively). However, after intervention, individuals who exhibited a greater increase in circulatory ­NAD levels following cold acclimation had higher cold-stimulated BAT glucose uptake (rho = 0.76, p = 0.02, n = 8). Additionally, circulatory ­NAD and NMN levels were signifi- cantly correlated with cold-stimulated BAT glucose uptake (rho = 0.76, p = 0.02, and rho = 0.71, p = 0.047, respectively) after the intervention. Furthermore, HOMA-IR correlated inversely with the circulatory ­NAD / NADH ratio after the intervention (rho= -0.9; p< 0.001; n=9), suggesting a potential link between redox balance and insulin resistance.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that individual variability in ­NAD responsiveness to cold acclimation may be linked to BAT metabolism, highlighting the potential role of ­NAD in thermogenic adaptation in obesity. Additionally, systemic NAD+ dynamics, which influence redox balance, may be linked to insulin sensitivity.

**Background and aims:**
Acute mild cold exposure activates brown adipose tissue (BAT) and modulates lipid and glucose metabolism. Moreover, meal-induced thermogenesis has been shown to be associ- ated with BAT function in humans. However, how acute cold exposure affects the postprandial secretion of hormones remains unclear. We investigated this phenomenon in lean volunteers, participants with obesity, and ice swimmers (IS).

**Materials and methods:**
Forty-six participants (15 lean, 14 IS vol- unteers, 35.1 years, 28.5kg/m2) were included. During one visit, vol- unteers were exposed to three hours of mild cold (cold-induced - CI) before meal intake, while on the other visit, they were kept in thermon- eutrality (room temperature—RT) before meal consumption. Hormone levels were analyzed before and 80 minutes after food intake. BAT glucose uptake rate ( F-FDG) and perfusion ( O-H O) were assessed with PET/CT scans.

**Results:**
CI BAT glucose uptake rate (11.7±9.3 in lean, 6.2±6.5 in volunteers with obesity, and 6.3±6.4 μmol/(100g*min); p=0.08) and perfusion (p=0.13) were comparable in the three groups. In the whole sample, cold exposure increased fasting glucose and triglycerides (TG) concentrations (5.3±0.5 CI versus 5.0±0.4 mmol/l RT for glucose and 1.2±0.5 CI and 1.0±0.6 mmol/l RT for TG, p<0.01), but only circu- lating TG reduced after food intake (from 1.2±0.5 to 1.1±0.6 mmol/l, p<0.01). Moreover, fasting (163.6±92.3 CI versus 136.4±80.3 pg/ml RT) and postprandial ghrelin concentrations were elevated in the cold in comparison to RT conditions (p<0.05). Cold also increased fasting GIP (38.6±16.8 CI versus 31.8±18.1 pg/ml RT) and PYY concen- trations (219.3±66.6 CI versus 181.6±43.0 pg/ml RT), whereas CI leptin was decreased at fasting and postprandially (p<0.05 for all). When we analyzed the groups separately, CI fasting TG concentra- tions were higher only in lean volunteers and IS (p<0.05 for all). CI leptin concentrations, on the other hand, were reduced in all groups at fasting and after food intake (p<0.05). Interestingly, CI fasting and postprandial GIP, along with CI fasting GLP-1 (217.6±150.5 CI versus 172.4±128.8pg/ml RT), were increased only in individuals with obesity (p<0.05 for all).

**Conclusion:**
Cold exposure modulated fasting and postprandial meta- bolic responses, altering TG concentrations and secretion of appetite- related hormones. These CI-induced changes in fasting and postpran- dial hormones could suggest adaptive responses to balance energy intake and expenditure. Moreover, chronic adaptation to cold, as in ice swimming practice, seems to affect postprandial metabolic responses. On the other hand, obesity blunts some of the metabolic effects of cold, including postprandial TG clearance. In summary, our data of compara- ble CI BAT glucose uptake and perfusion across the groups associated with meal-induced hormonal differences in response to cold suggest that body adiposity and long-term cold acclimation may play signifi- cant roles in the acute response to food intake under cold exposure.

**Background and aims:**
Pharmacological induction of thermogenesis is a promising strategy to increase energy expenditure. Despite identify- ing bioactive molecules that activate adipose tissue thermogenesis, none have shown clinical efficacy. This study aims to identify novel candidates enhancing thermogenic activity through multi-omics analysis of paired human brown and white adipose tissue biopsies.

**Materials and methods:**
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) samples from the deep neck region, characterized by enriched UCP1 mRNA expression and multilocular lipid morphology, were collected along with adjacent sub- cutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) biopsies from 15 thyroid surgery patients. Transcriptomic profiling was conducted using RNA sequenc- ing, while metabolomic and lipidomic analyses were performed via mass spectrometry. Comprehensive bioinformatics evaluation incorporated path- way analyses such as GO enrichment, KEGG, and BioPAN. To assess functional relevance, siRNA-mediated silencing of 100 genes identified through transcriptomics was conducted, followed by evaluating their impact on mitochondrial respiration in hMADS-derived brown adipocytes.

**Results:**
This approach identified 4174 differentially regulated tran- scripts, 59 metabolites, and 240 lipid species between BAT and WAT. Lipidomic data revealed enrichment of membrane and mitochondrial lipids in BAT, while neutral glycerolipids and fatty acids dominated WAT. BioPAN pathway analysis indicated activation of phosphati- dylserine synthesis and triglyceride reesterification in BAT. Several lipid-processing genes, including , and , emerged as potential candidates. Multi-omics factor analy- sis identified two key factors explaining nearly 60% of BAT-WAT vari- ability, with purine metabolites playing a major role. Functional screen- ing revealed several genes whose knockdown significantly affected mitochondrial respiration. Among the identified candidates, , and consistently influenced all mitochondrial respiration parameters.

**Conclusion:**
This multi-omics analysis identified novel candidate tran- scripts, metabolites, and lipids with potential roles in adipose tissue thermogenesis. The validation of 100 genes uncovered novel regulators of brown adipocyte activity. Further studies are needed to elucidate their roles in non-shivering thermogenesis, offering potential thera- peutic targets for metabolic disorders.

**Background and aims:**
We have reported that GDF15, a potent anti- obesity hormone, can be induced by metabolic stress in a manner dependent on TFEB, a master regulator of autophagy gene expression and lysosomal biogenesis. GDF15 acts through its receptor GFRAL and also increase sympathetic activity. Since RET, a GFRAL co-recep- tor, can affect neuronal growth and sympathetic nerves, we studied whether GDF15 can induce development or growth of sympathetic neurons in addition to its effect on sympathetic activity, which would contribute to weight loss by GDF15.

**Materials and methods:**
Both -transgenic and -knockout mice were used in all experiments to study a role of GDF15 in develop- ment and activity of sympathetic neurons. Whole-mount tissue fluores- cence staining and 3D imaging were performed to investigate the devel- opment and innervation of sympathetic nerves. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, energy expenditure, and serum epinephrine/ norepinephrine were measured to study the sympathetic activity and its effects on the whole body metabolism. Furthermore, superior cervical ganglions that have been widely employed as materials for sympathetic nervous system research were isolated to investigate effects of GDF15 on sympathetic neuronal cells intrinsically and extrinsically.

**Results:**
Surface area and volume of sympathetic neurite were increased in adipose tissues of -transgenic mice. Energy expenditure, thermogenesis, cold tolerance and sympathetic response to hypoglycemia were all increased in -transgenic mice. GFRAL was expressed in sympathetic ganglion cells, which was enhanced by GDF15. RET and its downstream signaling molecules such as AKT, ERK and CREB, were activated in the sympathetic ganglions by trans- genic expression of or treatment with GDF15 , leading to increased expression of genes related to thermogenesis, neu- rite growth or extension and catecholamine synthesis. Ex vivo treat- ment of the sympathetic ganglions with GDF15 also induced neurite growth and extension. Inverse phenotypes were observed in - knockout mice, showing physiological role of GDF15 in the develop- ment and activity of the sympathetic nervous system.

**Conclusion:**
These results indicate that GDF15 regulates not only sym- pathetic activity but also development or growth of sympathetic neu- rons through GFRAL expressed in sympathetic ganglion cells, which could contribute to energy expenditure and weight loss. Modulation of GDF15 could be a therapeutic option against diseases or conditions associated with dysregulated sympathetic activity such as idiopathic hypotension characterized by low sympathetic tone, hypoglycemic una- wareness, hypertension associated with increased sympathetic activity, heart failure, infection, sepsis, shock, obesity or cancer cachexia.

**EGFR-TKI erlotinib safeguards beta cell function in obesity- induced diabetes by targeting lipid metabolism**

O. Mukherjee

**Background and aims:**
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are emerg- ing as a novel anti-diabetic option, yet a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms is largely unexplored. Free fatty acids (FFAs) are known to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase, which contributes to increased hepatic steato- sis and insulin insensitivity in obese diabetic mice. Our recent reports indicate that a high-fat diet (HFD), combined with FetuinA—a lipid carrier that forms complexes with FFAs—intensifies lipid accumula- tion and steatosis in the pancreatic islets of mice. In our preliminary studies using an EGFR-inhibitor Erlotinib in obese mouse models, we observed reduced lipid accumulation in the islets, accompanied by enhanced insulin secretion and improved insulin sensitivity. This pre- sent study thus aims to evaluate the various islet lipid and cholesterol metabolism pathways influenced by FFAs via EGFR, and to assess their impact on the overall health and function of beta cells under conditions of obesity-induced diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
MIN6 (mouse insulinoma) cells were incu- bated with palmitate(0.75 mM)+FetuinA(100 μg/ml) for 36h, with/ without pre-treatment with Erlotinib(10 μM) for 1h. Post-treatment, the cells were analyzed using immunoblots and qPCR to evaluate the expression levels of various markers associated with lipid metabolic pathways, including FA synthesis, FA oxidation, triglyceride and cho- lesterol synthesis, etc. Additionally, glucose-stimulated insulin secre- tion (GSIS) assay was performed to assess the glucose-responsiveness of MIN6 cells. To validate the findings, C57BL/6J male mice (n=10) were fed a standard diet (SD) or HFD for 16 weeks. A 3rd group of mice received Erlotinib (100 mg/kg/day) for the final 4 weeks of HFD. GTT, ITT and GSIS assays were conducted to validate the diabetic models. Pancreas was processed for H&E staining. Pancreatic islets were isolated by Percoll gradient and the lipid metabolism mark- ers were assessed across all treatment groups. Serum lipid levels were measured by automatic biochemistry analyzer.

**Results:**
Erlotinib significantly reduced lipid accumulation in both MIN6 and mouse islets, as confirmed by Nile Red staining and the analysis of lipid droplet coat proteins PLIN5 and PLIN2 (~0.2 fold). It effectively downregulated the expression of key lipogenic markers ACC1, FASN (~0.6 fold), SREBP1, and PPARγ, alongside genes asso- ciated with triglyceride and cholesterol biosynthesis such as DGAT (~0.4 fold), SREBP2 and HMGCR (~0.3 fold). Simultaneously, Erlo- tinib upregulated mitochondrial lipid oxidative pathways, marked by increased CPT1 (~2.8 fold) expression, compared to HFD. Erlotinib treatment also lowered the expression of FFA-carrier FetuinA (~0.7 fold) and cholesterol transporter LDL-R, in both and studies. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were reduced, and histological analysis of pancreatic sections revealed decreased adi- pocyte infiltration in HFD-treated pancreas upon Erlotinib treatment. Insulin content, secretion and sensitivity were improved, accompanied by augmented glucose homeostasis, uptake and utilization.

**Conclusion:**
EGFR inhibition by Erlotinib safeguards against fatty infiltration of pancreas and restores beta cell function. Further explora- tion into EGFR’s role in lipid metabolism and its interaction with TKIs could pave the way for innovative treatments against T2D.

**Hyperlipidaemia per se does not induce beta cell hypersecretion or dysfunction in mouse islets and does not impaired beta cell mito- chondrial turnover in human islets in vivo**

**Background and aims:**
Hyperlipidemia is widely believed to cause lipotoxicity in peripheral organs and in pancreatic islets that leads to insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction respectively. Despite of numerous studies, the relevance of lipotoxicity is under long debate largely due to the difficulties in studies to dissect the impact of hyperlipidemia from other pathogenetic factors that often develop in parallel in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, we set to address this question in mouse and human islets where immunocompetent alB6 mice and immunodeficient NSG mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a control diet.

**Materials and methods:**
Metabolic phenotyping, high-resolution lipidomics and longitudinal imaging were applied. Mouse β-cell calcium dynamics was investigated in the transplanted Ins- Cre:GCaMP3 mouse islets using the anterior chamber of the eye platform. Using the same platform, human β-cell mitochondria mass and turnover were studied in transplanted human islets in which β-cell specific expression of a mitochondria turnover reporter was induced by lentiviral transduction during pseudoislet preparation.

**Results:**
AlB6 mice developed obesity, insulin resistance and relative β-cell functional deficits during HFD feeding. These prediabetes traits were not observed in HFD NSG mice that remained lean. Clinical chemistry analysis in mouse plasma shows that HFD induced similar degree of hypercholes- terolemia but different cytokine profiling in two strains. Plasma lipidom- ics, investigated in a smaller cohort, reveals that HFD induced comparable changes in lipid classes and most lipid species in the mice. Importantly, the changes in plasma lipidome correlate with insulin resistance and β-cell function in alB6 mice but not in NSG mice. Intravital imaging on mouse islets shows that, in contrast to our previously findings that mouse β-cells quickly developed dysregulated calcium dynamics in HFD alB6 mice, β-cells maintained normal calcium dynamics in NSG mice even after long-term high-fat feeding. Furthermore, human β-cells maintained normal mitochondria turnover when the recipient NSG mice were fed with HFD.

**Conclusion:**
Taking together, lean NSG mice remained insulin sen- sitive and normal glucose tolerance in spite of hyperlipidemia dur- ing high-fat feeding. In addition, mouse β-cell calcium dynamics and human β-cell mitochondria turnover in the transplanted islets were well maintained. We propose high-fat feeding in immunodeficient NSG mice a good model that provides a relatively “isolated” hyper- lipidemic environment where suspected diabetogenic factors could be explored. In conclusion, our data suggest that hyperlipidemia does not cause β-cell dysfunction and that β-cell hypersecre- tion and dysfunction are mostly likely downstream events of insulin resistance and chronic inflammation in T2D pathogenesis.

**Dynamic lipidomic features and their clinical correlations after vertical sleeve gastrectomy in obese subjects**

D. Lee

**Background and aims:**
Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is an effective and the most commonly performed surgical intervention for obesity. How- ever, detailed studies on the underlying mechanisms, particularly those involving lipid metabolism, remain limited. This study aimed to iden- tify novel pathways associated with the metabolic efficacy of SG by assessing alterations in the serum lipidomic profiles of obese subjects following surgery.

**Materials and methods:**
A pooled cohort study was constructed from two primary prospective observational studies on obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery. Among 81 obese subjects who underwent SG, this study included 50 subjects who completed pre- and post-SG follow-up studies. Serum lipidomic profiling were performed and sta- tistical analyses explored lipidomic alterations and their correlations with changes in clinical parameters.

**Results:**
Participants experienced a 25% reduction in body weight six months after SG, with a marked reduction (~70%) in hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance, and a twofold increase in plasma oxyntomodu- lin levels. The lipidomic analysis identified 751 serum lipids across 30 subclasses. Distinct postsurgical lipidomic signatures highlighted significant molecular shifts in lipid subclasses based on the fatty acyl composition, specifically toward longer and greater unsaturated traits, as well as the metabolic regulation of phospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, represented by unique lipid ratios. These changes cor- related with changes in clinical parameters, such as diabetes- and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease-related param- eters; hormones; and inflammatory and immune factors. Key findings included characteristic shifts in lipid species within triacylglycerol, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, with significant associations between changes in the levels of oxyntomodulin and specific lipid spe- cies affected by these shifts. In glycerophospholipid metabolism, the activation of the phosphatidylcholine-to-lysophosphatidylcholine con- version pathway and the upregulation of ether lipids were observed after SG, with the levels of some ether lipids correlating with liver stiffness measures. Furthermore, sphingolipid and cholesterol metabo- lism were closely interrelated. Metabolic remodeling of sphingolip- ids—characterized by a decrease in ceramide/sphingomyelin levels and an increase in hexosylceramide synthesis—emerged as an additional lipidomic signature after SG.

**Conclusion:**
These findings highlight the complex lipidomic remod- eling underlying the metabolic efficacy and therapeutic potential of SG.

**Background and aims:**
The mechanism of interorgan communi- cation contributing to dysregulated metabolism in type 2 diabetes remains incompletely understood. One underexplored signalling pathway involves extracellular vesicles (EV), which facilitate inter- cellular communication through lipid cargo. However, the EV lipid profile and its functional implications in type 2 diabetes remain largely unknown. Therefore, this study aims to characterize the lipid species present in EVs from individuals with type 2 diabetes and investigate how these lipid alterations influence metabolism in target organs.

**Materials and methods:**
Age and BMI-matched men and women with type 2 diabetes or control (n=46 total, n=11-12 per group) fol- lowed a standardised diet for one day prior to and on the day of serum sample collection. EVs were isolated from serum using size-exclusion chromatography and characterized by transmission electron micros- copy and western blot analysis. The EV lipidome was analysed by targeted sphingolipid profiling via liquid-chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The metabolic effects of hexosylceramides were assessed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by measuring glucose uptake with radiolabelled ­[ H]-2-deoxyglycose. Cells were treated with 1 μM HexCer(d18:1/16:0) for 12 hours before the glucose uptake assay.

**Results:**
Transmission electron microscopy and western blot analysis confirmed the presence of serum-derived EVs. In total, 81 sphingolip- ids were detected in serum-derived EVs. Principal component analysis highlighted distinct clusters indicating the EV sphingolipidome was altered in both men and women with type 2 diabetes versus control. Linear modelling revealed that nine hexosylated sphingolipids were significantly lower in men with type 2 diabetes versus control. The most highly abundant EV-glycosylated sphingolipid, HexCer(d18:1/16:0), was 1.7±0.6-fold lower in men with type 2 diabetes (adj.p=0.04). Three glycosylated sphingolipids were lower in women with type 2 diabetes versus control with LacCer(d18:1/24:1) being 1.5±0.3-fold lower in type 2 diabetes (adj.p=0.01). experimental valida- tion revealed that HexCer(d18:1/16:0) reduced glucose uptake in 3T3- L1 adipocytes (control 183.0±35.8 vs. treated 141.5±31.9 pmoles/ (mg*min), p=0.02).

**Conclusion:**
These findings demonstrate that EV-sphingolipid con- tent is altered in both men and women with type 2 diabetes. Notably, glycosylated sphingolipids were lower in serum EVs from individuals with type 2 diabetes and were shown to modulate glucose metabolism in adipocytes. This study reveals a novel role for EV-associated lipids and implicates a role for these lipid species in orchestrating inter-tissue communication.

**Background and aims:**
The gut-liver axis plays a pivotal role in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Metabolic Dysfunction- Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key mediators of inter-organ crosstalk in the pathogenesis of both conditions, with the gut emerging as a key player in T2D progression. Our previous findings revealed that the protein content of gut-derived EVs (GDEs) reflects the organism’s metabolic state. Here, we will investigate how the protein and lipid cargo of GDEs contribute to diabetogenic effects and whether treatment with met- formin and pioglitazone modifies GDEs’ cargo and function.

**Materials and methods:**
C57Bl/6J mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of daily treatment with pioglitazone or metformin. GDEs were then isolated, and lipidomics and proteomics were performed. To evaluate the biological impact of GDEs, fluorescently labeled GDEs from NCD- and HFD-fed mice were injected retro-orbitally into normoglycemic mice every other day for six weeks. Furthermore, the NicheNet tool, originally designed for studying cell-cell communication, was adapted to predict how omics data from EVs impact the recipient cells.

**Results:**
Administration of GDEs from prediabetic mice to healthy mice induced diabetogenic features, including hepatic triglyceride accumulation, weight gain, and glucose intolerance. Interestingly, GDEs were predominantly captured by Kupffer cells (KCs) in the liver. In vitro, exposure to prediabetic GDEs significantly increased the number of lipid droplets in KCs compared to control GDEs. The size of FFAs was reduced when KCs were exposed to GDEs from HFD-metformin or -pioglitazone, compared to GDEs from HFD alone. Multiblock sPLS-DA revealed a strong positive correlation between the proteomic and lipidomic of GDEs (Pearson’s correlation coeffi- cient of 0.95). Proteins associated with lipid transport were reduced in prediabetic GDEs, however, exhibited a positive correlation with glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins, suggesting an altered membrane composition. Specific lipid classes, including ceramides and lysophosphatidylethanolamines, also displayed distinct associa- tions. The modified NicheNet tool indicated that in the prediabetic state, selenocysteine lyase may support hepatic redox balance via gut- to-liver EVs signaling, whereas in the healthy state, Apolipoprotein E potentially modulates the inflammatory cytokine Interleukin 1 beta to counteract hepatic inflammation. The proteomic profiles of GDEs from diabetogenic mice treated with pioglitazone or metformin closely resembled those of control GDEs.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, our findings underscore the pivotal role of GDEs in promoting diabetic and obesity-related traits, highlighting their critical function in regulating lipid transport to KCs and empha- sizing the importance of their cargo in driving the pathogenesis of these diseases.

**Central mGPDH regulates glycolipid/energy metabolism through the FOXO1-POMC axis**

Y. Li

**Background and aims:**
Mitochondria glycerol 3-phosphate dehy- drogenase (mGPDH) has been considered as a key metabolic factor. However, its role in hypothalamus is unclear. The study was designed to investigate the effect of mGPDH on peripheralglycolipid/energy metabolism in arcuate nucleus hypothalamus (ARC).

**Materials and methods:**
8 weeks mGPDH KO mice were divided into 2 groups randomly. And Obrb-Cre mice were also separated into 2 groups, transfected with AAV-DIO-GFP or AAV-DIO-mGPDH by stereotaxic surgery and nucleus-micro injection technique. Then, fed with normal chow diet (NCD) or high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks separately. The metabolic changes are measured with metabolic cage. Glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were conducted. Micro-CT was used to observe body composition. The morphology and fat accumulation of liver was revealed by H&E or Oil red staining. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to address the expression of hypothalamic neurons. The subcellular structures of neurons were detected using electron microscope. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and inflamma- tion factors in ARC were measured with ELISA. To further explore, POMC-mGPDH KO and mGPDH mice were randomized into two groups. Meanwhile, POMC-Cre mice were transfected with AAV- DIO-GFP or AAV-DIO- mGPDH. All above mice were respectively given NCD or HFD for 12 weeks. The same methods were also per- formed to verify the effects of mGPDH. Next, transcriptomics and metabolomics were conducted to map out the mechanism of mGPDH in POMC. Finally, FOXO1 inhibitor was infused into the third ventricle with osmotic pumps for 2 weeks.

**Results:**
With HFD feeding, mGPDH knockout lead to expression changes of some neurons in ARC dramatically. For further investigating the effect of mGPDH in hypothalamic ARC, we constructed mGPDH overexpression in Obrb neuron (Obrb neuron mainly exists in hypotha- lamic ARC). In HFD groups, mGPDH overexpression of Obrb neuron decreased food intake, attenuated obesity, contributed to the increas- ing of oxygen consumption and treadmill distances, statistically. And glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were apparently improved by overexpression of mGPDH in ARC. Meanwhile, mGPDH overexpres- sion in ARC was in a pronounced favour of HFD-induced hepatic fat accumulation significantly. Further, it showed a potentiated up-regula- tion of POMC neuron. To deep explore the role of mGPDH in POMC neuron, POMC mGPDH overexpression and POMC mGPDH knockout mice were constructed. In male mice, POMC-mGPDH KO displayed opposite phenotypes observed in Obrb-mGPDH overexpression mice (There were no significant changes in female mice). Electron micro- scope showed POMC mGPDH KO resulted in mitochondria swollen and the disorganization or disappearance of the mitochondrial cristae. ROS was increased, SOD activity was decreased, the expression of inflammation factors was elevated. Thus, reverse data were obtained from POMC mGPDH overexpression. With analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics, FOXO1 was involved in the up-regulation of POMC by mGPDH. Then, FOXO1 inhibitor was continuously infused into the third ventricle for 14 days, the influence of mGPDH on peripheral glycolipid/energy metabolism were eliminate.

**Conclusion:**
The present study demonstrates that hypothalamic mGPDH in arcuate nucleus could modulate peripheral glycolipid/ energy metabolism to ameliorate HFD induced metabolic disorder through FOXO1-POMC axis.

**LY6D and lipid synthesis: a key player in the pathogenesis of meta- bolic associated fatty liver disease**

S. Wu

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) represents a significant metabolic disorder and has emerged as the most prevalent chronic liver disease globally, with no effective pharmacological treatments currently available. A key pathological characteristic of MASLD is the excessive accumulation of triglycerides (TG) within the liver. Research indicates that the de novo lipogenesis (DNL) of hepatic fatty acids contributes to increased hepatic TG accu- mulation, serving as a primary factor in the development of hepatic steatosis. The sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) is a critical transcription factor that regulates hepatic DNL. It has been identified as a downstream protein within the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, where PI3K inhibition leads to reduced SREBP1c levels through proteasome inhibition. Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) is a ubiquitously expressed adaptor protein involved in the transduction of PI3K/AKT signals across various tumor pathologies. Nevertheless, the role of GRB2 in modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway under the pathological conditions of MASLD remains unclear. Lymphocyte antigen 6 family member D (LY6D) is a membrane-bound protein associated with hepatic steatosis, although the mechanism by which LY6D mediates its development requires further elucidation. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of LY6D in tri- glyceride accumulation within hepatocytes during the progression of MASLD. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether LY6D interacts with GRB2 to modulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby affecting SREBP1c to enhance the DNL.

**Materials and methods:**
Hepatocyte steatosis was induced in HHL5 hepatocytes and primary mouse hepatocytes through palmitic acid treatment, followed by transfection with human or mouse LY6D ade- novirus, respectively. In vivo, hepatocyte-specific overexpression of LY6D was achieved using adeno-associated virus administered via the rat tail vein, and LY6D or SREBP1c knockout mice were generated using the Cre-loxP system. An MASLD animal model was established through a high-fat diet. The expression levels of LY6D in both cell and animal models of MASLD were assessed. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and bioinformatic analyses were employed to investigate the signal- ing pathways involved in LY6D regulation of MASLD. The molecular mechanisms underlying LY6D-mediated regulation of DNL were fur- ther explored using co-immunoprecipitation, liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry, protein ubiquitination analysis, and small molecule inhibitors.

**Results:**
LY6D was found to be upregulated across all MASLD mod- els. Transcriptomic analysis of murine liver tissues identified LY6D as a critical regulator of hepatic steatosis. Both in vivo and in vitro experi- ments demonstrated that LY6D overexpression resulted in increased lipid accumulation within hepatocytes, whereas LY6D inhibition ame- liorated hepatic steatosis. Mechanistically, LY6D overexpression was shown to enhance the expression of the SREBP1C signaling pathway and modulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through its interaction with GRB2, thereby influencing de novo lipogenesis.

**Conclusion:**
This study elucidates that LY6D activates the PI3K/AKT/ SREBP1C signaling cascade via its interaction with GRB2, which in turn regulates lipid production in MASLD.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is associated with adipose tissue inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, and insulin resistance. The integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-PINCH-parvin (IPP) complex is critical for focal adhesion and contributes to obesity-asso- ciated ECM remodelling and insulin resistance, but the specific role of α-parvin in adipose tissue remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of adipocyte-specific deletion of α-parvin in obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
Adipocyte-specific α-parvin knockout (KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermate controls were fed either a chow or 60% high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Both male and female mice were included in the study. Adipose tissue was analysed for mor- phological changes, ECM remodelling, and inflammation. Metabolic parameters were assessed by body weight and composition, and glu- cose and insulin tolerance tests. In vitro adipogenesis was assessed in primary stromal vascular cells using Oil Red O staining. Data were analysed using two-way ANOVA, with p < 0.05 considered statisti- cally significant.

**Results:**
HFD feeding induced obesity and adiposity in WT mice. KO mice of both sexes displayed decreased body weight gain, percent body fat and adipose tissue weight after HFD feeding relative HFD-fed WT controls. Despite reductions in obesity and adiposity, KO mice did not improve glucose or insulin tolerance on HFD. In contrast, the epididy- mal adipose tissue of HFD-fed KO mice had smaller adipocytes (p < 0.05), increased macrophage infiltration (p < 0.01), and higher collagen deposition (p < 0.05). Moreover, in the adipose tissue of HFD-fed KO mice relative to HFD-fed WT mice, inflammatory markers including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were significantly elevated (p < 0.01) in; pro- tein expression of adiponectin was significantly reduced (p < 0.01); and protein expression of ILK, PINCH, and β-parvin was also signifi- cantly reduced. KO mice also displayed altered lipid metabolism, with increased plasma and liver triglycerides under chow diet (p < 0.05), but reduced plasma and liver triglycerides under HFD (p < 0.05). KO mice exhibited significantly impaired in vitro adipogenesis of stromal vascular cells (p < 0.05), which may contribute to decreased adiposity observed in HFD-fed KO mice.

**Conclusion:**
Mice lacking α-parvin in adipocytes had impaired adipose tissue function with elevated collagen deposition and inflammation, and displayed altered systemic lipid metabolism in obesity. In the absence of α-parvin, the integrity of IPP complex was significantly reduced, suggesting that IPP complex is critical in maintaining adipose tissue function and metabolic regulation in obesity.

**expression in adipocytes lowers obesity and insulin resist- ance risk via adipocyte differentiation control**

I. Mamjoud, Cormont

**Background and aims:**
The transcription factor p53 is activated in adipocytes during obesity and promotes systemic insulin resistance. Among its regulators, the tumor suppressor ­p19 stabilizes p53 and is induced in adipocytes of obese mice. However, the metabolic impact of overexpression remains unknown.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate the role of ­p19 in obesity- related dysfunction, we generated mouse models: ­p19 knockout in white and beige/brown adipocytes ­(p19 ), ­p19 knockout exclusively in beige/brown adipocytes ­(p19 ), and p53 knock- out in both (p53 ). Mice expressing AdipoQ-cre or UCP1-cre were used to generate white and beige/brown adipocyte-specific and only beige/brown adipocyte-specific invalidation, respectively, by crossing them with floxed ­p19 or floxed p53 mice.

**Results:**
­p19 mice exhibit no phenotype on a standard diet. However, after 10 weeks on a high-fat diet, they develop glucose intol- erance and insulin resistance compared to control littermates. This phe- notype is driven by increased weight gain, fat mass accumulation, and a pathological expansion of epididymal adipose tissue via adipocyte hypertrophy. Body weight gain is independent of food intake or activ- ity. Instead, the underlying cause is a significant reduction in energy expenditure. When housed at thermoneutral conditions, no metabolic differences between ­p19 and their controls are observed. Thus, impaired thermogenesis in brown/beige adipocytes contributes to the pronounced weight gain in ­p19 mice. However, no meta- bolic differences were observed in ­p19 mice, indicating that ­p19 in brown/beige adipocytes does not play a significant role. The thermogenic dysfunction in ­p19 mice likely arises from inter- organ crosstalk. Additionally, p53 mice do not develop meta- bolic disorders, indicating that ­p19 ’s effects are p53-independent. To explore underlying mechanisms, we studied early events after 3 weeks on a high-fat diet, when weight and metabolic parameters in ­p19 mice remain comparable to controls. Transcriptomic anal- ysis of epididymal adipocytes reveals upregulation of lipid metabolism genes and downregulation of inflammation-related genes. Additionally, p53 target genes are reduced, supporting ­p19 ’s role in stabilizing p53. At this stage, ­p19 invalidation appears to protect adipocyte function. We also observed lower epididymal adipose tissue mass in ­p19 mice, altered progenitor subpopulations, and reduced gene expression of markers for mature pre-adipocytes, suggesting a defect in adipogenesis.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that ­p19 upregulation in adi- pocytes during obesity development plays a sequential role. In early obesity, ­p19 exerts deleterious effects via p53 stabilization, while promoting hyperplasic adipose tissue expansion through a p53-inde- pendent mechanism, later conferring beneficial effects. ­p19 ’s dual function may act as a protective mechanism, limiting obesity-related metabolic complications.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is associated with several diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. GPR75, a brain-enriched orphan receptor, has emerged as a novel anti-obesity target. Individu- als carrying a protein-truncating GPR75 variant have lower BMI, and knockout mice are protected against diet-induced obesity. However, it remains unknown if an intervention aimed at silencing GPR75 would replicate the germline mutation and induce weight loss in established obesity. We administered Gpr75 siRNA via intracer- ebroventricular (ICV) injections to obese mice and monitored their metabolic and behavioral phenotypes over nine weeks.

**Materials and methods:**
Obese female mice on a high-fat diet for 28 weeks were treated with PBS, Control siRNA (scrambled), or Gpr75 siRNA via two stereotaxic ICV injections (300 μg/injection, =12/ group), spaced three weeks apart. A non-injected control group ( =12) was included for reference. Body weight and food intake were meas- ured weekly for four weeks, followed by five weeks in a home-cage style metabolic system for detailed metabolic and behavioral pheno- typing. Body composition was assessed at baseline and at the study’s conclusion, along with terminal tissue and blood collection.

**Results:**
Gpr75 siRNA treatment robustly reduced body weight com- pared to Control siRNA (-20 ± 3.3% vs. -3.2 ± 2.3% change from baseline, <0.001). At study conclusion, Gpr75 siRNA achieved ~50% mRNA knockdown across brain regions, including hypo- thalamus, striatum, brainstem, and cerebral cortex (-45 ± 3.0%, -50 ± 3.1%, -47 ± 1.6%, and -31 ± 5.1% of PBS, <0.001, respectively). Consistent knockdown was observed three weeks post-second injection (assessed in =4 mice/group). Weight loss was associated with reduced caloric intake following Gpr75 siRNA treatment compared to Control siRNA, noticeable two weeks post-treatment and sustained throughout the study (71 ± 3.5 kcal/week vs. 95 ± 4.9 kcal/week, <0.001). No differences in energy expenditure or physical activity were found, indi- cating that Gpr75 siRNA-induced weight loss was driven by reduced food intake without signs of locomotor deficiencies. Body composition revealed significantly reduced fat mass with Gpr75 siRNA compared to Control siRNA treatment (-27.1 ± 6.3% vs. -6.1 ± 3.1% change from baseline, <0.05). A slight reduction in absolute lean mass was observed with Gpr75 siRNA compared to Control siRNA (-5.9 ± 2.1% vs. 3.0 ± 1.4% change from baseline, <0.05), but relative lean mass increased (49.3 ± 1.7% vs. 44.8 ± 0.7%, <0.05). There were no sig- nificant differences in gastrocnemius muscle weight or mean muscle fiber cross-sectional area, suggesting nominal contribution of muscle mass loss to absolute lean mass reduction.

**Conclusion:**
These findings strongly suggest that GPR75 plays a major role in appetite regulation, emphasizing the potential of tar- geting GPR75 in the brain for weight loss. The weight loss observed with ~50% knockdown is comparable to that achieved in obese mice treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Thus, GPR75 holds promise as a novel target for future obesity treatments.

**Activation of glucagon-like peptide-1-, but not glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide-receptor expressing neurons in the parasubthalamic nucleus supresses food intake in mice**

F. Reimann, Okoro, F.M. Gribble

**Background and aims:**
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and dual GLP1R/glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide- receptor (GIPR) agonists are now established agents to treat dia- betes and obesity, but the underlying physiology is insufficiently understood. In mice both GLP1R- and GIPR-activation reduces food intake through central mechanisms and both receptors are expressed widely across the central nervous system. Here we focus on one under-researched area, the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), a caudal nucleus of the hypothalamus, which previously has been implicated in the anorexic action of other hormones, such as cholecystokinin, peptide-YY and amylin.

**Materials and methods:**
Mice expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of the GLP1R or the GIPR promoter were injected with rAAV-fxSTOPfx-hM3Dq or rAAV-fxSTOPxf-ChR2 in the PSTN to enable chemogenetic activation or anterograde projection tracking of the relevant neuronal populations. Mice expressing ChR2 specifically in proglucagon expressing (PPG) neurons were used to optogeneti- cally activate PPG projections to the PSTN. Food intake was assessed either after <16 h fasting or in ad libitum fed animals at the beginning of the dark phase and glucose tolerance was assessed in response to intraperitoneal glucose administration (ipGTT).

**Results:**
Both GLP1R and GIPR expression was reported in the PSTN of relevant Cre-mice and peripheral administration of either liraglu- tide or acylGIP, both known to reduce food intake in mice, increased cFos staining, an activity indicator, in the PSTN. Chemogenetic activa- tion of ­PSTN , but not ­PSTN neurons reduced food intake in fasted and ad libitum fed mice. Activation of either population did not affect ipGTT. PPG-neurons tracking showed innervation of the PSTN and optogenetic activation of these fibers reduced feeding in fasted and ad libitum fed mice, increasing the latency to feeding initiation. ­PSTN neurons innervated many nuclei with known roles in feed- ing regulation, including the parabrachial nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract, the brain stem nucleus in which the majority of PPG neurons are located.

**Conclusion:**
Our studies demonstrate a role of ­PSTN neurons in the control of food intake. This likely is a target for the central GLP1 system, with PPG-somata in the brain stem, as previous reports have shown that fluorescently labelled GLP1-analogues do not penetrate much beyond the blood-brain barrier and were not detectable within the PSTN. How peripheral administered GLP1R and GIPR agonist recruit the PSTN and the importance of this pathway for the behavioural out- come remains to be determined.

**A novel CRFR2 selective UCN2 analogue, HM17321, enhances favourable body recomposition, energy expenditure and metabolic health in DIO mice**

S. Lee, Lee, I. Choi

**Background and aims:**
Incretin-based therapies effectively promote weight loss but also cause inevitable lean mass loss, compromising weight loss quality (WLQ). Urocortin-2 (UCN2) shows potential for enhancing lipolysis and muscle hypertrophy, offering a strategy to improve WLQ. To optimize receptor signaling and achieve these outcomes alongside weight loss, a novel corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-2 (CRFR2) selective UCN2 analog, HM17321, was designed using a structure-based approach. The present study evalu- ates the potential effects of HM17321 on body composition and energy expenditure in DIO mice.

**Materials and methods:**
In DIO mice, HM17321 was administered, with semaglutide (Sema) included as a comparative control. Energy balance analysis was performed twice, on day 10-12 and 32-34 during drug treatment, using a comprehensive animal metabolic monitoring system (CLAMS). Whole-body fat mass and lean body mass were measured using a ¹H-Mini-Spec system, prior to CLAMS assessment. At the end of the study, blood and tissue samples (muscle, fat, and liver) were subjected to histologic analysis.

**Results:**
HM17321 markedly reduced body weight compared to the pair-fed group, suggesting the presence of additional weight loss mechanisms beyond food intake inhibition. Despite a significant reduc- tion in food intake, HM17321 led to a favorable body recomposition, with a continued increase in lean mass and a sustained reduction in fat mass, indicating that HM17321-induced body weight loss was pri- marily driven by fat loss. Notably, while Sema-induced weight loss (both fat and lean mass loss) was accompanied by a decrease in energy expenditure, HM17321 significantly increased energy expenditure with achieving similar weight loss. Importantly, unlike Sema, HM17321 significantly increased absolute muscle weights while reducing skeletal muscle lipid deposition. Furthermore, HM17321 markedly decreased serum ALT, AST, and total cholesterol levels. Regarding the underly- ing mode of action of the WLQ improvement, HM17321 exhibited a potent lipolytic effect in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human visceral white adipocytes, while also promoting differentiation and inducing hypertrophy in both C2C12 myoblasts and human skeletal muscle cells, suggesting its direct effects on adipose tissue catabolism and skeletal muscle anabolism.

**Conclusion:**
HM17321 monotherapy uniquely promoted favorable body recomposition by selectively reducing fat mass while increas- ing lean mass in DIO mice. The body recomposition could directly contribute to the increase in basal metabolic rate (BMR), as evidenced by elevated energy expenditure. Furthermore, HM17321 improved overall metabolic health, reinforcing its potential as a next-generation therapeutic for obesity and metabolic disorders. By simultaneously enhancing adipose tissue catabolism and skeletal muscle anabolism, HM17321 offers a promising strategy for achieving superior WLQ.

**Background and aims:**
Adipose tissue undergoes significant expansion during obesity. This remarkable plasticity relies on its angiogenic capacity. Our previous study demonstrated that pericytes surrounding vessels in the visceral adipose tissue detach in a platelet- derived growth factor (PDGF-B)-dependent manner during obesity development. However, the regulatory factors involved in the process are unknown. Obese adipose tissue is chronically exposed to inflam- matory cytokines and hyperinsulinemia. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of these microenvironmental factors on peri- cyte detachment from adipose vessels, a key step of angiogenesis. Furthermore, we generated transcriptome libraries for endothelial cells and pericytes from visceral adipose tissue of lean and obese mice to analyse the pathophysiology in relation to their interactions.

**Materials and methods:**
Epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) was harvested from 12-week-old male C57BL/6J and PDGFRβ- deficient mice, and tissue tips were cultured as organ explants. These explants were exposed for 24 hours to TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, IFN-γ, or insulin. Sunitinib (a PDGFRβ inhibitor) or Brefeldin A (an inhibitor of protein secretion) was applied before stimulation. Whole-mount immunofluorescence staining was analysed using a confocal laser microscope (ZEISS LSM900) to determine the peri- cyte-coverage ratio. The RNA-Seq library for pericytes and endothe- lial cells was generated from flow-sorted pericytes and endothelial cells obtained from stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of eWAT from male C57BL/6J mice fed a normal chow diet (lean) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks.

**Results:**
In the cultured eWAT, TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, and IFN-γ did not affect pericyte behavior, whereas LPS and insulin promoted peri- cyte detachment from vessels. LPS-induced pericyte detachment was inhibited in both sunitinib-treated tissues and those from PDGFRβ- deficient mice. Consistently, LPS stimulated mRNA expression of Pdgfb in the cultured SVF of eWAT as well as cultured bone marrow- derived macrophages. Conversely, insulin-induced detachment of peri- cytes was unaffected by sunitinib pretreatment or PDGFRβ deficiency but was inhibited by Brefeldin A. Transcriptomic analysis identified obesity-associated gene expression changes. Enrichment analysis showed upregulation of cell migration and adhesion genes in endothe- lial cells, while pericytes exhibited upregulation of cell migration genes and downregulation of cell-substrate adhesion genes in obesity, consist- ent with detachment. Additionally, changes in the expression of several proteases implicated in cell adhesion detachment were observed.

**Conclusion:**
Obesity-associated endotoxemia and hyperinsulinemia appear to contribute to the detachment of pericytes from adipose ves- sels, initiating angiogenesis. We are currently investigating the impor- tance of several factors revealed by transcriptome analysis in relation to pericyte detachment and plan to present these findings at the meeting.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is linked to neurological complications. The visual cortex (VC) presents hyper- activation, followed by its later atrophy with T2D progression. Both occur prior to visual difficulty. The latter is only observed with VC hypoactivation. Thus, biochemical changes occur prior to symptomatic alterations. Hence, we would benefit from biomarkers in earlier stages. In fact, we recently showed a taurine-involving compensatory mecha- nism in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed and streptozotocin (STZ)-injected rats, against a hyperactive primary VC (V1). We aim to corroborate this and analyse the underlying synaptic and metabolic dysregulation.

**Materials and methods:**
3 animal models (male Wistar rat): control (SD, 10 weeks (w) ); obesity (HFD, 10w); T2D (HFD, 10w + low STZ dose (35 mg/kg), 4th w). Then, all rats underwent H-MRS to analyse metabolites involved in synapses and other mechanisms; and fMRI to study the LED light-stimulated hemodynamic response. The animals were sacrificed, and VC was collected for proteomics. Proteins (VIP > 1 or p < 0.05) were used for cluster analysis (Mfuzz package, RStudio).

**Results:**
We identified 3 clusters of proteins based on their changes in the groups. The first cluster identified proteins with an upregulation in HFD rats and further upregulation in T2D. The latter has proteins involved in glutamatergic synapse, specifically in the NMDAR-involv- ing synapse and SNARE complex, as well as inhibitory metabotropic receptors. Meanwhile, cluster 2 identified proteins with a HFD upregu- lation and its maintenance in T2D. This cluster also includes proteins of glutamatergic synapse. But these are now specific to glutamate transport and synthesis, as well as calcium transport. Altogether, it potentiates the hyperactive V1 in T2D (p=0.226 vs SD). Cluster 2 also demonstrates the augmentation of proteins involved in the GABAergic synapse. In contrast, cluster 3 shows a decreased GABA synthesis in T2D. In contrast, taurine ­(GABA R agonist) levels are increased in T2D (p=0.0211 vs SD, p=0.0153 vs HFD). Such seems to potentiate the GABAergic synapse, against hyperexcitation as a protective mecha- nism. In fact, taurine is negatively correlated with elevated glutamine levels in T2D (p=0.0252 vs SD). Cluster 3 also shows downregulation of proteins involved in myelination and cytoskeleton organization in T2D.

**Conclusion:**
In obesity and early stages of T2D, taurine and its inhibi- tory activity, once bound to the ­GABA R, may confer a compensatory mechanism to counteract the hyperactivity and associated excitotoxicity in V1.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is frequently associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), contributing to increased disease severity, morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for promoting weight loss and improving metabolic health including T2D remission. However, not all patients achieve their target weight loss or T2D remis- sion post-surgery. This study aims to identify pre-surgery adipose tissue (AT) factors that predict surgical response by uncovering the patho- physiology underlying the heterogeneous phenotypes of individuals with T2D and obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
The bariatric surgery cohort from the Leipzig Obesity BioBank (LOBB) consists of 48 individuals with obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) and T2D. All participants underwent a two-step surgical procedure: sleeve gastrectomy followed by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The cohort includes omental visceral and abdominal subcutaneous AT biopsies, body composition measurements and metabolic param- eters from both steps. Bulk RNA-seq was performed on all paired AT samples and pooled single-nucleus RNA-seq was conducted only on first step samples for selected subgroups. An unsupervised machine learning approach was used to integrate pre-surgery bulk RNA-seq, snRNA-seq and clinical data to identify potential biomarkers for pre- dicting surgical outcomes.

**Results:**
Bariatric surgery resulted in an average relative BMI loss of 22.46 ± 11.6%. 30 patients achieved T2D remission post-surgery irrespective of the degree of weight loss. We stratified individuals into subgroups based on sex, T2D remission status and degree of weight loss. We generated cellular maps for each subgroup using snRNA-seq, providing novel insights into the relationship between adipose tissue function and T2D remission. Several cell types and subtypes were iden- tified that were exclusive to specific subgroups. These findings were validated through unsupervised multicellular factor analysis. By inte- grating cellular data with bulk transcriptomics and clinical parameters, we identified the strongest predictors of bariatric surgery outcomes in individuals with T2D and obesity.

**Conclusion:**
These datasets offer a unique opportunity to study the AT heterogeneity in individuals with obesity and T2D. The potential biomarkers provide valuable insights by revealing biological drivers of surgical outcomes that can be applied to precision medicine and personalized treatment for both T2D and obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Circadian rhythms are crucial for metabolic functions in adipose tissue (AT), as a significant part of its transcrip- tome shows 24-hour oscillations. Circadian disruption of white AT has been strongly associated with the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, despite its importance, and given the intrinsic heterogeneity of AT depots, the molecular mechanisms driving these rhythmic patterns are still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the endogenous circadian transcriptome signatures of two different AT depots, subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT), and to study possible differential circadian marks.

**Materials and methods:**
Preadipocytes were isolated from SAT and VAT collected during the bariatric surgery from 8 severely obese donors (BMI 42.7 kg/m2, age 49.6 years, n = 2 men and n = 6 women) and differentiated into mature adipocytes over 14 days. After synchro- nization with a pulse of 10 μM forskolin, cells were collected at 4-hour intervals over a 24-hour period. Global gene expression analysis was performed using RNA-seq and the oscillations were evaluated by cosinor.

**Results:**
The results showed a higher number of oscillatory tran- scripts in VAT (450) compared to SAT (71) adipocytes, sharing 48 transcripts. The large majority of VAT oscillatory transcripts showed acrophases were 3-4 hours later than in SAT. The core clock genes ( ) showed robust oscillation in both adipocyte types with no changes in circadian parameters between them. Further, oscillating pathways in SAT included PI3K- Akt signaling ( ), whereas oscillating pathways in VAT included insulin resistance ( ), AMPK signaling ( ), and HIF-1 signaling ( ). Significant differences were also observed in a large number of non-oscillatory tran- scripts between SAT and VAT adipocytes, affecting lipid and glu- cose metabolism among other pathways, like cAMP signaling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, crucial for AT metabolism and T2D pathogenesis.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings revealed that both SAT and VAT adipocytes exhibit endogenous circadian oscillation of their transcriptome , with clear differences in their circadian signatures. This differential gene expression pattern between VAT and SAT adipocytes suggests that circadian rhythms play a key role in determining the regulatory imprint of AT depots. Further research is needed to elucidate the inter- play between the adipocyte circadian clock and AT metabolism and T2D pathogenesis.

**Metabolic consequences of the reduction of Store-Operated Ca Entry**

D.E. Al-Ansari, K. Machaca

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is the 5th leading cause of death worldwide and is associated with severe comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes - core elements of metabolic syndrome. Store-Operated-Ca2+Entry (SOCE) is a mecha- nism responsible for refilling ER Ca2+ stores and in addition regulates multiple cellular functions. Emerging evidence links SOCE to various metabolic processes including glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and lipid accumulation. However, direct evidence linking SOCE to obesity and adipose tissue function remains limited, primarily due to the lethality and severe complications associated with complete knock- outs in mice of the SOCE genes, STIM1 and Orai1. Here, we employed a novel mouse model exhibiting partial reduction in SOCE through a STIM1 hypomorphic mutation, thereby avoiding lethality, to examine the physiological effect of reduced SOCE activity. We aim to inves- tigate the role of SOCE in white and brown adipose tissue (WAT and BAT) homeostasis.

**Materials and methods:**
STIM1 hypomorph (Hypo-KI) and control mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% Fat) to induce obesity. We assessed weight gain, body composition and metabolic profiles using TD-NMR, CLAMS system, Glucose and insulin tolerance tests (GTT, ITT), and whole blood lipid analysis. Thermogenesis was evaluated using FLIR thermal imaging and real-time measurement of interscapu- lar temperatures with implanted RFID temperature sensors. This was followed by histological analysis. Mitochondrial respiration and ATP production were assessed using Seahorse XF assays in mouse embry- onic fibroblast cells (MEFs). Transcriptomic changes were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing of cells isolated from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of BAT and inguinal WAT (iWAT).

**Results:**
Partial reduction of SOCE activity (~65%) in Hypo-KI com- pared to controls was confirmed using Fura-2 calcium influx assay. Hypo-KI mice on a HFD exhibited significantly increased weight gain , higher fat-to-lean mass ratio, and adipocyte hyper- trophy compared to controls While both Hypo-KI and control mice on a HFD exhibited diabetic phenotypes, no significant differences were observed between groups in GTT and ITT profiles. Neverthe- less, significantly decreased levels of LDL and cholesterol in Hypo- KI mice were observed compared to controls. Interestingly, Hypo-KI mice demonstrated reduced thermogenesis, evident from lower inter- scapular BAT temperatures and impaired cold-stress thermoregula- tion . Additionally, MEFs showed significantly impaired mitochondrial respiration and ATP production in Hypo-KI mice. While no significant changes were detected in single-cell RNA sequencing of iWAT, reduced mitochondrial gene expressions specifically in adi- pocyte precursors, such as ASC1 and ASC2 were detected in BAT, supporting the observed impairment in thermogenesis and mitochondrial function.

**Conclusion:**
Our results demonstrate that reduced SOCE activity in Hypo-KI mice leads diet-induced obesity, impairs thermogenesis, and alters cellular metabolism, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. To address that, we have generated adipose-specific (AdipoQ- Cre) and BAT-specific (UCP1-Cre) STIM1 knockout mice. Future work using these models will enable us to validate molecular pathways and understand the role of SOCE in lipid metabolism and thermoregula- tion, potentially identifying novel therapeutic targets for obesity and metabolic disorders.

2. versity of Dundee, Dundee, UK, Centre for Cardiovascular Science,

**Background and aims:**
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are closely linked to chronic health conditions, impacting people’s qual- ity of life. This study aimed to investigate changes in the extracel- lular matrix (ECM) of adipose tissue in individuals with obesity and T2D using an untargeted proteomics approach, to understand how ECM remodeling may contribute to these conditions.

**Materials and methods:**
Paired human visceral (VAT) and subcu- taneous (SAT) adipose tissue samples were collected from age- and sex-matched individuals with normal weight (NW), obesity without (OB) or with T2D (n=4-5 per group). The tissue was decellular- ized to enrich ECM proteins, analyzed using quantitative DIA-based mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified based on p-value <0.05 and fold change >1.5. Path- way and functional analyses were performed using ShinyGO gene ontology, and protein interactions were assessed with BioVenn and STRING.

**Results:**
Proteomics identified 3,000-5,000 proteins in VAT and SAT, with 150-400 upregulated and 200-700 downregulated DEPs in OB and T2D. Key DEPs included actin, ECM regulators, col- lagens, and ECM signaling proteins. Cellular component analysis confirmed ECM enrichment in all tested samples. In OB, ECM regulators (MMPs, ADAMTS, TIMPs) and structural proteins (col- lagens, elastin, laminin, fibronectin, perlecan) were reduced, likely to support adipose tissue expansion. In contrast, their expression increased in T2D, particularly in VAT, suggesting fibrotic remod- eling. Integrin-related proteins were downregulated in OB but upregulated in T2D, particularly in VAT, indicating altered cell- matrix interactions. Proteoglycan HSPG2 was decreased in OB but increased in T2D in VAT, while proteoglycan BGN followed a similar trend but in SAT, suggesting depot-specific ECM remod- eling. Actin cytoskeleton pathways increased in OB but decreased in T2D. ILK, beta-parvin, talin, and vinculin remained unchanged in OB but were downregulated in T2D, suggesting impaired inte- grin-actin linkage. Profilin, filamin, and gelsolin were elevated in OB but reduced in T2D, while FAK and Src were downregulated in T2D, indicating disrupted ECM-integrin mechanotransduction. Gene ontology analysis of OB and T2D highlighted alterations in lipid metabolism, ECM organization, adhesion, fibrosis, and insulin signaling. Compared to NW, OB and T2D showed opposite ECM and cytoskeletal trends, suggesting a transition from adaptive ECM remodeling in OB to fibrosis in T2D, particularly in VAT.

**Conclusion:**
This study reveals distinct ECM-cytoskeleton remod- eling in OB and T2D, with VAT more affected than SAT. In OB, ECM softening and cytoskeletal upregulation support adipose tissue expansion, while in T2D, ECM stiffening and cytoskeletal disrup- tion promote fibrosis and dysfunction. Altered integrin signaling impairs mechanotransduction, and the loss of integrin-cytoskeletal proteins in T2D may affect insulin signaling. VAT-specific ECM changes highlight its role in metabolic disorders, suggesting ECM- targeted therapies for obesity-related diseases.

**Background and aims:**
Subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) mitochon- drial metabolism is impaired in obesity, but its recovery after weight loss remains unclear. Here, we investigated mitochondrial metabolism in AT following bariatric surgery or lifestyle intervention.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied 40 participants with obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m²) undergoing Roux-en-Y or one-anastomosis gastric bypass, and 52 participants with obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) undergoing lifestyle intervention including a low-calorie diet. Body composition, plasma lipids, glucose tolerance (HOMA-index, HbA1c), and inflammation were measured at baseline, and at 5-6 and 12-24 months post-inter- vention. From subcutaneous AT we analysed global transcriptomics (RNAseq) and proteomics (LC-MS/MS), with mitochondrial tran- scripts/proteins filtered using MitoMiner database. Targeted mitochon- drial measurements included mitochondrial mtDNA content (qPCR), oxidative capacity (respirometry, surgery cohort), and mitochondrial localization within AT lipid droplets (immunocytochemistry).

**Results:**
Both interventions improved metabolic health. Between base- line and 12 months of weight loss, bariatric surgery led to upregulated mitochondria-related gene expression by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondrial biogenesis and RNA/protein processing pathways (Ingenuity pathway analysis, z-scores >2.3) but downregu- lation in these pathways after lifestyle modification (z-scores <-2.0). However, upregulated mitochondrial-related proteomics pathways including OXPHOS, protein processing, fatty-acid oxidation and tricar- boxylic acid cycle were observed in AT after both interventions (z-scores >2.0,p<0.05). After bariatric surgery, increased oxidative respiratory capacity by coupled respiration, maximal respiratory capacity, and mito- chondrial efficiency (p<0.05 all), increased mtDNA content (1.03 ± 0.34 vs. 1.37 ± 0.66, relative amount, p<0.001), and greater mitochondrial area associated with adipocyte lipid droplets (11.3 ± 3.8 vs. 13.8 ± 6.6%,p<0.05) were measured. In contrast, no changes in mitochondrial amount or localization were found after lifestyle intervention.

**Conclusion:**
Bariatric surgery enhances AT mitochondrial metabolism by transcript and protein levels and targeted mitochondrial measure- ments, while lifestyle-induced weight loss presents with contradic- tory or no changes in these parameters. The findings highlight distinct mitochondrial adaptations after surgical and lifestyle-induced weight loss in AT.

**Background and aims:**
Lipodystrophy syndromes are rare disorders characterized by adipose tissue abnormalities and severe metabolic complications. Genetic testing can be critical for diagnosis, yet a sig- nificant number of cases remain unresolved. We aimed to investigate the genetic landscape in patients presenting with metabolic disorders and suspected lipodystrophy using whole-exome sequencing (WES).

**Materials and methods:**
We enrolled patients referred to our clinic for metabolic disturbances suggestive of lipodystrophy. The most fre- quent clinical manifestations included the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and his- tory of triglyceride-associated pancreatitis. WES was performed, and variants were classified according to ACMG guidelines.

**Results:**
Among the patients analyzed, WES revealed rare and poten- tially pathogenic variants in several key genes implicated in lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, and insulin signaling. Notable findings included:A PIK3R1 c.1945C>T (p.Arg649Trp) pathogenic variant, which is associated with SHORT syndrome.Two frameshift variants in CEL gene, both classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS), whixh are related to Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 8 (MODY 8).Two distinct heterozygous LMF1 variants, one of which was classified as potentially pathogenic, associated with lipase maturation defects.Additional VUS were identified in INSR (hyper- insulinemic hypoglycemia, familial 5, HHF5) and SLC2A2 (type 2 DM, autosomal dominant) genes.One patient carried dual heterozygous variants in PPARG and BBS1, raising suspicion of both familial partial lipodystrophy type 3 and Bardet-Biedl syndrome.

**Conclusion:**
WES analysis revealed rare or novel variants contribut- ing to the complex phenotypes observed in patients with suspected lipodystrophy. Our findings highlight the genetic heterogeneity and diagnostic challenges of these syndromes.

2. land, Helmholtz Institute for Metabolic, Obesity and Vasular Research,

**Background and aims:**
Visceral adiposity and the dysfunctional remodeling of adipose tissue (AT) are powerful predictors of the onset of metabolic diseases in obesity. The strong and timely correlation between these factors has led previous research to suggest that intrinsic elements within AT are key contributors to the disruption of systemic nutrient homeostasis, resulting in these adverse outcomes. To develop innovative strategies for targeting adipose tissue in metabolic diseases, a deeper understanding of these factors is imperative.

**Materials and methods:**
In this study, we used metabolically healthy obesity as a human model to study the relationship between AT dys- function and metabolic disease severity. We collected and analyzed subcutaneous and visceral AT biopsies of people with adiposity in a large-scale, cross-sectional study, categorizing them into MHO and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) groups.

**Results:**
Despite similar body mass indices, these groups exhibited striking differences in visceral AT volume, lipid profiles, liver func- tion, and systemic glucose clearance. By using single-nucleus RNA sequencing in combination with deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequenc- ing datasets, we created a comprehensive map of cellular maladaptation in obesity. Our findings reveal that while the cellular composition of subcutaneous AT remains relatively unchanged, visceral AT undergoes extensive remodeling that correlates with disease severity. Notably, vis- ceral mesothelial cells were found to be the most significantly affected by metabolic disease, with these cells stratifying into distinct subpopu- lations that shift from a mesenchymal to an inflammatory phenotype in individuals with metabolic disease. Our data points to the direction that under healthy visceral AT expansion, mesothelial cells can tran- sition along the epithelial to mesenchymal lineage, a process that is disrupted with the onset of disease. RNA-scope based stainings further demonstrated that these mesenchymal-like mesothelial cells are not only located at AT boundaries but also interspersed within the tissue. In vitro experiments showed that inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cultured mesothelial cells mimics the mesenchymal-like subpopulations observed in human AT, impacting the differentiation capacity of progenitors and the metabolic flexibility of adipocytes.

**Conclusion:**
This study marks the first transcriptional atlas of human subcutaneous and visceral AT, comparing individuals with MHO and MUO. By integrating cell-type specific information, bulk transcriptom- ics of AT samples, clinical parameters, and in vitro experiments, we identified the most robust AT-specific predictors of metabolic health. Our findings pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches aimed at mitigating the harmful effects of visceral adiposity and improving metabolic outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Bariatric surgery is recognized as the most effective treatment for obesity, inducing weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity. Skeletal muscle (SM) and adipose tissue (AT) are key players in regulating whole-body insulin sensitivity. However, their epigenetic and transcriptional changes after bariatric surgery have not yet been comprehensively investigated over time.

**Materials and methods:**
The BARIA cohort study provided clinical phenotypes from eight obese participants for RNA sequencing and from six obese patients for DNA methylation profiling. Skeletal mus- cle and adipose tissue samples were obtained at baseline (week 0), 12 weeks, and 52 weeks following bariatric surgery to assess transcrip- tional and epigenetic alterations.

**Results:**
Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue showed clear molecular alterations with simultaneous weight reduction and enhanced periph- eral insulin sensitivity. At 12 weeks after surgery, 509 genes were differentially expressed in AT and 1038 in SM, increasing to 1110 and 2013, respectively, at 52 weeks. Transcriptomic changes in metabolic pathways (e.g., MAPK and insulin signaling) appeared at 12 weeks in SM and at 52 weeks in AT (e.g., AMPK and insulin signaling). Furthermore, the surgery also induced changes in mRNA levels of transcription factors in both tissues. A higher number of differentially expressed transcription factors were detected at 52 weeks, of which several candidates are known to play a role in insulin signaling (e.g. PPARG) in AT and mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. GABPA, RFX7) in SM. Integration of transcriptome and methylome data revealed that approximately 80% of differentially expressed genes are affected by epigenetic changes. DNA methylation profiles were altered in 413 dif- ferentially expressed genes in AT and 844 in SM at week 12, as well as in 951 and 1582, respectively, at week 52. Epigenetic changes in meta- bolic pathways, such as MAPK and insulin signaling, were observed in SM at 12 weeks, while AMPK signaling and PI3K‑Akt signaling alterations occurred in AT at 52 weeks.

**Conclusion:**
Significant alterations in epigenetic and transcriptional programs were observed in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, with more pronounced effects at week 52. Despite both tissues contrib- uting to whole-body insulin sensitivity, their epigenetic and transcrip- tional alterations after surgery occur in a time-dependent manner. In response to surgically induced weight loss, skeletal muscle exhibited faster molecular changes than adipose tissue.

**Nonclinical evaluation of SNA-003, a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, demonstrating enhanced pharmacokinetics and metabolic efficacy in rodent models of type 2 diabetes**

Y. Park

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is charac- terised by insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction, resulting in poor glycaemic control and the progression of metabolic complications. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) improve glycaemic control and body weight through multiple mechanisms, including insulin secretion, glucagon suppression, delayed gastric emptying, and appetite regu- lation. However, currently available agents such as semaglutide and the dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide often lead to gastrointestinal adverse events due to rapid systemic absorption, with approximately 10% of patients discontinuing therapy within the first 12 weeks. In addition, the once-weekly dosing regimen may be suboptimal for long-term chronic disease management. This study aimed to develop a long-acting GLP-1RA formulation, SNA-003, using a proprietary drug delivery platform to enhance pharmacokinetics (PK), improve tolerability, and enable sustained glycaemic control in T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
SNA-003 and a commercially available comparator were subcutaneously administered as a single dose to male Sprague-Dawley rats. Plasma concentrations were analysed to compare PK parameters, including Cmax, Tmax, AUC, and peak- to-trough ratio (PTR). Simulations based on single-dose data and actual repeated-dose PK evaluations were performed. In addition, a 3-week repeated-dose study was conducted in a T2DM mouse model to evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects. Key parameters assessed included body weight, food intake, fat mass, fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and insulin sensitivity.

**Results:**
SNA-003 exhibited approximately 30% lower Cmax than the comparator, while maintaining a comparable AUC. No significant difference was observed in T1/2 between formulations, but Tmax was significantly delayed from 4 to 24 hours, indicating sustained- release characteristics. Upon repeated dosing, the PTR of SNA-003 ranged from 1.2-1.8, notably lower than the comparator (2.0-3.7), suggesting more stable and consistent drug exposure. In the T2DM mouse model, SNA-003 demonstrated superior reductions in body weight and fat mass at the same dose level, along with significant improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance indicators, confirming its enhanced metabolic efficacy.

**Conclusion:**
SNA-003 improved exposure uniformity and tolerabil- ity compared to the comparator, and exhibited robust glucose-lower- ing and metabolic effects in diabetic animal models. A phase 1 clini- cal trial is currently underway in healthy adults using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose design. Preliminary results support the preclinical PK/PD findings and suggest that SNA-003 may represent a promising next-generation GLP-1RA for durable glycaemic control and metabolic management in patients with T2DM.

**Background and aims:**
A concern has emerged that many people may stop anti-obesity medications not long after starting them, but population-based data remain scarce. We examined the likelihood of and factors associated with discontinuation of semaglutide for weight loss (SEMA-WL) in Denmark.

**Materials and methods:**
Using data from nationwide health registries, we created a cohort of all adults without diabetes who initiated SEMA- WL between its launch date in Denmark (December 01, 2022) and up to June 01, 2023. SEMA-WL discontinuation was defined with a 60 days grace period. We estimated the likelihood of stopping SEMA-WL use within the first 12 months after initiation. We examined predictors of discontinuation using Poisson regression analyses to compute age/ sex-adjusted risk ratios (RR).

**Results:**
We identified 52,284 adults without diabetes initiating SEMA- WL (median age 50 years, 72% women). Half of these individuals (n=26,778, 51%) stopped treatment within one year. There was an increased likelihood of discontinuation in younger users (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.46-1.54 for 18-30 years vs. middle-aged 45-60 years old) and in men versus women (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.11-1.15). One-year discontinuation was also higher for people who had previously used gastrointestinal medications (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07-1.11) or psychiatric medications (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.10-1.14), for those with pre-exist- ing cardiovascular disease (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14) or Charlson comorbidity index score 3+ (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17), and for users living in a low- versus high-income municipality (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.11-1.20).

**Conclusion:**
One of two people who initiated SEMA-WL in Denmark stopped therapy within one year. Factors associated with discontinu- ation included younger age, male sex, socioeconomic deprivation, higher comorbidity level, and previous use of gastrointestinal and psy- chiatric medications.

**Background and aims:**
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obe- sity increase the risk for infertility, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), gestational diabetes, preterm birth and birth of a hypertrophic neonate. Effective weight loss can improve the endocrine profile, the menstrual cycle, the rate of ovulation, and the likelihood of a healthy pregnancy. However, lifestyle intervention alone is not so effective for weight loss in the majority of cases. As there are no data about weight loss and fertil- ity outcomes in patients with obesity on treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide combined with metformin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of subcutaneous semaglutide in combination with metformin for treatment in obese PCOS patients with prediabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We prospectively enrolled 20-consecu- tive obese PCOS patients with prediabetes, (mean age 32 years) with BMI 34.8 ± 4.3 kg/m2, on combination therapy with metformin 1000 mg/daily and subcutaneous semaglutide 0.25 - 0.5 mg once weekly. Patients were followed up for 6-8 months, and checked-up monthly by obesitologist, and every 3 months by gynecologist. All patients were clinically examined and human body composition (lean mass, fat), weight were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis InBody 370.

**Results:**
There were significant weight reduction after 5 months of therapy with semaglutide (0.25-0,5 mg) subcutaneously and metformin 1000 mg/daily (98.4 ± 15.5 kg vs. 85.5 ± 16.6 kg, p ≤ 0.05), also in BMI (34.8 ± 4.3 kg/m2 vs. 30.2 ± 4.7 kg/m2, p ≤ 0.05). Similarly there were also significantly reduction of fat mass (41,3 ± 10.8 kg vs. 32.3 ± 10.3, p ≤ 0.05) but no impact on lean mass (31.1 ± 4.5 kg vs. 29.1 ± 5.1 kg, p=0.56). Withing 6-8 months from the initiation of the observation, a significant improvement in fertility was observed, with 60% of the treated patients achieving pregnancy. All resulting pregnan- cies culminated in the delivery of euptrophic neonates.

**Conclusion:**
In this study, we demonstrated the significant efficacy of combined treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide and metformin in effective weight reduction and improving fertility in obese patients with prediabetes and PCOS.

**Background and aims:**
Injectable peptide-based GLP-1 receptor ago- nists (GLP1RAs) are effective therapies for obesity and diabetes, but present challenges related to patient compliance and scalable produc- tion. Small-molecule GLP1RAs offer advantages in oral administration and scalability but poor activity on rodent GLP1R poses challenges during preclinical development. To improve translational relevance, we developed a humanized GLP1R (hGLP1R) mouse model by replac- ing the murine GLP1R (mGLP1R) with hGLP1R using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.

**Materials and methods:**
The hGLP1R mouse model was generated by replacing mGLP1R with hGLP1R using CRISPR-Cas9 gene edit- ing. Pharmacological characterization involved acute (n=7-11/group) and chronic (n=10/group) treatment studies to assess the metabolic effects of semaglutide (a peptide GLP1RA, 10 and 30 nmol/kg) and orforglipron (a small-molecule GLP1RA, 0.3 and 3 mg/kg) in lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) hGLP1R and wild-type (WT) mice. 3D whole-brain c-Fos imaging was applied to evaluate brain activation signatures following acute treatment. Dunnett’s test one- or two-factor linear model with interaction was used for all statistical analyses, data are shown as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM).

**Results:**
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed hGLP1R expres- sion in pancreatic beta cells, the brainstem, and the hypothalamus. In single-dose studies, semaglutide and orforglipron showed similar effects on body weight (-2.3 ± 0.6% and -2.5 ± 0.6% from baseline, both p<0.001), 24h food intake (1.6 ± 0.1 g and 1.7 ± 0.2 g, both p<0.001), 24h locomotor activity (3.3E5 ± 2.85E4 beam breaks, p=0.01 and 2.76E5 ± 1.5E4 beam breaks, p=0.05), glucose tolerance (AUC​ mM*min: 771 ± 18 and 856 ± 48, both p<0.001) , and conditioned taste aversion (aversion index: 35 ± 5%, p=0.05 and 30 ± 3%, p=0.01) in lean hGLP1R mice. Semaglutide, but not orforglipron, showed metabolic effects in WT lean mice. Chronic orforglipron treat- ment (0.3 and 3.0 mg/kg) reduced body weight (from baseline: -4.6 ± 0.8 %, p=0.05 and -12.9 ± 1.8 %, p=0.01) and food intake in DIO hGLP1R mice but not in WT DIO controls. 3D whole-brain imaging confirmed both compounds stimulated canonical appetite-regulating regions in hGLP1R mice.

**Conclusion:**
These findings establish the Gubra hGLP1R mouse as a translational model for evaluating metabolic effects of small-molecule GLP1RAs for the treatment of obesity and related disorders.

**Background and aims:**
Secondary obesity due to craniopharyngi- oma (oCP) is complex and challenging to treat. Studies evaluating the weight effects of GLP1 analogues (aGLP-1) in this population are rare and have limited sample sizes. Our objective was to assess the weight effects and safety of aGLP-1 in a national cohort of patients with oCP.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective multicenter study (16 French obesity centers) including adults with oCP who received one or more types of aGLP-1.

**Results:**
A total of 124 patients were included, with a mean age of 44.6 years (±13.9) and a mean BMI of 39.7 kg/m² (±9.1). Among them, 42% had diabetes, and 62% were diagnosed with CP after the age of 18. A total of 77% received Semaglutide, 43% Liraglutide, 18% Exenatide, and 14% Dulaglutide. The average weight loss was -5.0% (-2.0 kg/m² BMI) over a mean period of 40 months, with significant inter-individual variability. The weight effect was significantly more pronounced with Semaglutide (-7.3% over 21 months, with an aver- age dose of 1.2 mg/week). A total of 22 patients (17%) experienced corticotropic decompensation and/or diabetes insipidus, with 15 requir- ing hospitalization. Other adverse effects were mainly gastrointestinal (nausea 22%, vomiting 15%), leading to treatment discontinuation in 12% of cases.

**Conclusion:**
This real-world retrospective study demonstrates that aGLP-1 treatments lead to moderate but significant weight loss in adult oCP patients. The efficacy appears lower than in common obesity, and predictive factors for treatment response remain unclear. Managing adverse effects, particularly gastrointestinal issues, is crucial to limiting treatment discontinuation. Increased vigilance regarding the adjustment of Hydrocortisone/Desmopressin treatments is necessary.

**Tirzepatide promotes fat and lean mass loss without loss of muscle mass or function in diet-induced obese mice**

M.K. Brahma, Davies, J.F. Unitt, N.R. Mirza, F. McIntosh, W. Pijacka, S.P. Vickers

**Background and aims:**
Incretin-based therapies promote rapid weight loss in obese patients by suppressing food intake. However, this weight loss is associated with reductions in both fat and lean body mass. The loss of lean mass may have adverse consequences on metabolic health and the overall quality of life. With increased weight loss through phar- macotherapy, there is an increased risk for adverse effects on muscle quantity, composition, and function: an issue of especial relevance to older obese patients. While clinical data clearly show reduced lean mass in obese patients taking GLP-1 based medications, data on their effect on skeletal muscle mass or function in preclinical models are limited. In this study, we investigated the impact of tirzepatide (TZP), a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist on lean mass, muscle mass, and muscle function in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL/6J mice fed a 45% high-fat diet for 31-weeks were randomised to treatment based on body weight (at baseline, the mean body weight was 49.7g), food and water intake, lean mass and grip strength. TZP (10 nmol/kg, sc, once every three days, n=8) or vehicle (n=7) were administered for 5 weeks. Body weight, food and water intake were measured daily. Body composition was assessed by DEXA (at baseline, day 14 and 35). Locomotor activity (novel environment test) was measured on Day 33 using video track- ing to provide a general assessment of locomotion. Grip strength was measured using a grip strength meter (Ugo Basile) to assess skeletal muscle strength at baseline and on day 34. The weights of lower limb skeletal muscles (gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, soleus, and quadri- ceps muscles), heart and liver were measured on day 36.

**Results:**
TZP treatment induced a -23.5% body weight loss in obese mice from baseline to day 36 as compared with a -1.3% loss in vehicle- treated mice (P<0.001 comparisons with vehicle). This was accompa- nied by a significant reduction in cumulative food intake (p<0.001). TZP treatment significantly (p<0.05) reduced fat mass (-51.9%), lean mass (-5.5%), and bone mineral content (-14.8%) from baseline to Day 35. Ex vivo skeletal muscle (tibialis anterior, quadriceps, gas- trocnemius, and soleus muscle) weights corrected to tibia length were unchanged by TZP treatment. TZP treatment did not significantly change grip strength (gF) on Day 34. TZP-treated mice exhibited significant increases (p<0.05) in locomotor activity (cm) and aver- age velocity (cm/s) compared to vehicle-treated mice on day 33 when placed in a novel environment. TZP treatment induced a significant reduction in heart (p<0.05) and liver (p<0.01) weights on Day 36.

**Conclusion:**
TZP administration resulted in marked body weight loss in obese mice by reducing both fat and lean mass. This was not associated with adverse effects on skeletal muscle weight or func- tion, consistent with emerging clinical data that TZP does not affect muscle composition (SURPASS-3 MRI), notwithstanding species and endpoint differences. Increased locomotor activity in animals treated with TZP are likely related to body weight loss and associated health benefits rather than a stimulant drug action. Future analysis, exploring changes at a histological, biochemical, and transcriptomic level may reveal molecular changes induced by TZP treatment in skeletal muscle.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic adaptation to weight loss (reduced energy expenditure beyond what would be expected from the loss of tissue mass) is a counterregulatory response to negative energy balance opposing further weight loss. Treatment with CagriSema (a combina- tion of amylin and GLP-1 receptor agonists) in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats reduces food intake but also prevents metabolic adaptation; the latter accounting for about one third of the weight loss. Here, we studied molecular mechanisms involved in the prevention of metabolic adaptation during CagriSema-induced weight loss.

**Materials and methods:**
Diet-induced obese rats were treated with vehicle or CagriSema (cagrilintide: 2 nmol/kg and semaglutide: 2 nmol/kg) for 20 days. A calorie-restricted group weight matched to the CagriSema cohort was included to distinguish the metabolic effects of CagriSema from diet-induced weight loss (n=15). Mitochondrial function was assessed in skeletal muscle, liver and white adipose tissue. Electron microscopy of mitochondrial content and morphology was performed on skeletal muscle tissue along with SERCA efficiency and myosin ATPase activity. Metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics and transcriptomics was performed in skeletal muscle and liver tissue to assess overall molecular responses.

**Results:**
CagriSema treatment resulted in a ~15% vehicle-adjusted weight loss (p<0.0001). Weight matched rats required supply of ~22% fewer calories than that consumed in the CagriSema-treated group (p<0.005), which is consistent with previous experiments demonstrat- ing lower energy expenditure in weight matched rats. Proton leak in mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscle was similar in vehicle- and CagriSema-treated rats but was ~20% lower in the weight matched group relative to CagriSema (p<0.02). Liver and adipose tissue mito- chondrial respiration and myosin ATPase activity in skeletal muscle was similar in all groups. SERCA efficiency, proteomics and electron microscopy image analyses are ongoing. Transcriptomics, metabo- lomics and lipidomics revealed markedly fewer molecular changes vs. vehicle in the CagriSema group than in the weight matched group, despite identical weight loss.

**Conclusion:**
Taken together, we conclude that CagriSema treatment prevents metabolic adaptation partly by preventing a reduction in mito- chondrial proton leak in skeletal muscle. In addition, the multi-omics signature indicates that CagriSema-induced weight loss, in contrast to weight loss by diet restriction, bypasses the normal molecular adapta- tions to weight loss in metabolically active tissues. Human trials are required to determine the translatability and clinical relevance of these findings.

**Background and aims:**
Treatment with GLP1-RAs results in greater weight loss in women. A phase 1 trial investigated treatment with OW s.c. petrelintide; effects by sex were explored post hoc.

**Materials and methods:**
Healthy participants (N=48) with over- weight/obesity (79% men, median age 49 yrs, BMI 29 kg/m2, body weight (BW) 92 kg, waist circumference (WC) 102 cm) were rand- omized 3:1 to petrelintide or placebo within three cohorts and treated for 16 weeks. After up-titration, target doses of 2.4, 4.8 and 9.0 mg were administered for 12, 8 and 6 weeks, respectively. AEs, BW and WC were reported in all participants and post-hoc in petrelintide treated men and women. The pooled placebo group included only 2 women.

**Results:**
At 16 weeks, mean BW decreased by 4.8, 8.6 and 8.3% and WC by 5.0, 7.2 and 7.6 cm with the three petrelintide doses versus 1.7% (BW) and 1.9 cm (WC) for pooled placebo. The incidence of gastroin- testinal (GI) AEs was low with only one treatment discontinuation due to GI AEs. Vomiting was reported only in this one participant. A con- sistently greater treatment response was observed in women across the three cohorts (table), whereas incidence of GI AEs appeared similar.

**Conclusion:**
Petrelintide treatment resulted in clinically relevant reductions in BW and WC; women appeared to respond better, with a retained favorable tolerability profile. A phase 2 obesity trial with petrelintide is ongoing.

**Background and aims:**
In people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, persistent weight loss can be obtained by bariatric surgery, such as Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), with potential remission of diabe- tes through restoration of insulin sensitivity and -secretion. RYGB has been reported to improve beta cell function in individuals with type 2 diabetes, but the effects on beta cell mass are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in beta cell mass in individuals with and without remission of type 2 diabetes after RYGB using ­[ Ga] Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 PET/CT imaging.

**Materials and methods:**
Age- and BMI-matched individuals with (n=8) and without (n=9) remission of type 2 diabetes up to 4 years after RYGB underwent a combined arginine stimulation test (ARGT) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to determine beta cell function. Subsequently, beta cell mass was quantified using PET/CT imaging after infusion with 100±5.6 MBq of ­[ Ga]Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4.

**Results:**
Individuals with remission of type 2 diabetes after RYGB had a shorter type 2 diabetes duration before RYGB compared to individu- als without remission (8.1±5.7 vs 18.2±8.2 years; p=0.0096). Upon RYGB, beta cell function was significantly improved in the remission group (HOMA2-%B 62 ± 12% vs HOMA2-%B 103 ± 32%, p=0.013), which remains stable for non-remitters. When comparing both groups after RYGB, beta cell function was better in individuals with remission compared to individuals without remission of type 2 diabetes, based on both ARGT (AUC​ 1.1±0.41 vs 0.32±0.16 nmol/l × mmol, p=0.001) and OGTT (AUC​ :AUC​ our data showed similar beta cell mass in individuals with and without remission of type 2 diabetes (3.6 (3.4-5.4) vs 3.8 (1.9-4.5) kBq/MBq, p=0.87). Furthermore, beta cell mass did not correlate with beta cell function or body weight parameters.

**Conclusion:**
Individuals with remission of type 2 diabetes after RYGB have better beta cell function compared to those not achiev- ing remission, although no significant differences in beta cell mass are observed between the groups. Our data argue against a stimulating effect of RYGB on beta cell mass, although potential reactivation of nonfunctional (so-called dormant) beta cells in remitters cannot be excluded.

**Background and aims:**
Histological studies suggest that individuals with type 2 diabetes have a smaller pancreas and lower beta cell mass compared to healthy individuals, although considerable individual variation exists. In addition, intrapancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) represents another risk factor of type 2 diabetes. However, whether a small pancreas with high IPFD and lower beta cell mass are causes or consequences of type 2 diabetes is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the interplay between pancreatic volume, IPFD and beta cell mass using ­[ Ga]Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 PET/CT imaging in a large variety of individuals either with or without type 2 diabetes or other metabolic disturbances.

**Materials and methods:**
This posthoc analysis included 52 individu- als: 25 with type 2 diabetes, 7 with remission of type 2 diabetes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 8 without remission of type 2 dia- betes after RYGB, 3 without type 2 diabetes and 9 without (a history of) type 2 diabetes who underwent RYGB. Baseline fasting glucose and C-peptide levels were determined to compute beta cell function (%B) and insulin resistance (IR) using the HOMA2 model. All participants underwent PET/CT imaging after infusion with 102±5 MBq of the ­[ Ga]Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 tracer. The total pancreatic uptake of ­[ Ga]Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 was determined as a measure for beta cell mass. In addition, we measured the pancreatic volume and pan- creas attenuation as a measure of IPFD on CT. Subsequently, Spear- man correlation coefficients between beta cell mass, IPFD, pancreatic volume and HOMA2 indices were estimated.

**Results:**
We observed a positive correlation between the total pan- creatic tracer uptake, representing overall beta-cell mass, and both pancreatic volume (Spearman r=0.66, p<0.0001) and pancreatic CT attenuation (Spearman r=0.29, p=0.037). In addition, the total pan- creatic tracer uptake correlated with HOMA2-%B (Spearman r=0.48, p=0.0006), but did not correlate with HOMA2-IR (Spearman r=0.040, p=0.79).

**Conclusion:**
Our data indicate that a smaller pancreas accompanied by pancreatic fat accumulation is associated with lower beta cell mass, which contributes to impaired insulin secretion and thereby an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

**Identification of novel pancreatic acinar cell sub-populations in type 2 diabetes**

2. burgh, UK, Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle
3. upon Tyne, UK, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity leads to ectopic fat deposition within the pancreas in type 2 diabetes (T2D), that may impair β-cell function via unknown mechanisms Our previous clinical imaging studies have shown that pancreas volume is 2/3 of normal in T2D accompanied with high intrapancreatic fat content and limited insulin secretory function. Given that the acinar compartment constitutes most of the pancreas mass, the observed loss of volume may reflect changes in acinar cells. We hypothesize that “lipotoxicity” alters the whole cellular environ- ment within the pancreas mediating change in acinar/ductal cell behav- iour related to β-cell dysfunction.

**Materials and methods:**
We have previously optimized a BD Rhap- sody single nucleus RNA sequencing protocol (snRNA-seq) to study human pancreas in T2D. We have collected pancreatic tissues within the Quality in Organ Donation biobank (QUOD-PANC) and gen- erated 22 Illumina libraries from overweight/obese donors (BMI >25kg/m : 14 donors with T2D and 7 age-matched non-diabetic controls). We used a pipeline developed in-house to cluster data, identify distinct cell populations and inform their potential transition and interaction. In addition, we have caried out detailed histopatho- logical assessment of the pancreata from those donors.

**Results:**
We aimed to retrieve/sequence ~35,000 nuclei/donor and here we present data on ~400,000 nuclei in total after QC. Our interim data analysis confirms clear representation of the main pancreatic cell populations including acinar, ductal, islet, immune, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells. Acinar cells were clustered in 7 major sub-populations, one large transitional cluster (acinar-ductal), and 3 other minor transitional populations. Notably, immune cell and the transition clusters were more distinct in the diabetes group. In addition, the three minor transitional acinar clusters shared sig- nature genes of islet, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells, respec- tively. Comparison of cell ratios of the identified cellular populations between T2D and control groups revealed 3 different clusters (ductal 1, acinar-ductal, and acinar 3, (Figure 1) indicating a major shift (transition) between ductal and acinar cell population in T2D.

**Conclusion:**
We have identified several sub-populations of acinar cells that may represent cellular phenotypic transitions that eventu- ally lead to loss of pancreas mass and β-cell dysfunction in T2D. We propose that this cellular transition is mediated by lipotoxicity. Further work is underway to identify and validate the key differen- tially expressed genes in the transition clusters to interrogate their function and unravel the potential role of toxic lipids in this process.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes is a leading non-communicable disease, responsible for 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2019, with mortality further increasing when including complications. Type 2 diabetes, the most prevalent form, exhibits heterogeneous phenotypes influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, with obe- sity being a primary contributor. A key factor in disease progression, particularly in the severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) cluster, is pancreatic islet cell dysfunction, which affects glucose homeostasis. However, the extent of heterogeneity among islet cell populations and the molecular mechanisms underlying β-cell dysfunction during obesity progression remain unclear.

**Materials and methods:**
Single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing were used to assess islet cell plasticity at different stages of obesity and hyperglycemia. Findings from the diet-induced obesity (DIO) model were compared with published datasets from obese and type 2 diabetes human populations, as well as db/db and STZ-induced diabetic mouse models. We confirmed the model through plasma analysis and metabolic tests like glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT).

**Results:**
Pancreatic islets undergo significant transcriptional and epigenetic changes during obesity progression. Within these islets, distinct subpopulations of alpha, beta, and delta cells were identi- fied, some of which exhibited functions beyond hormone secretion, an observation consistent across both human and mouse models. Trajectory analysis indicated that these cells may be involved in dedi- fferentiation and transdifferentiation processes. Furthermore, both immune and non-immune cells contributed to obesity-associated inflammation within the islets. Analysis of cell-cell communication revealed unique ligand-receptor interactions, some of which were exclusive to diet-induced obesity (DIO) models, highlighting their potential role in disease progression.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrate that pancreatic islets undergo substantial changes in cellular composition and gene expression across both endocrine and non-endocrine cell types in response to diet-induced obesity. Additionally, we mapped the dynamic trajec- tories between endocrine cell populations and identified key cellular communication networks. This dataset provides valuable insights into islet plasticity, functional adaptation, and the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated dysfunction.

**The long-term outcome of mice lacking autophagy in pancreatic beta cell**

K. Ikeda, Iida, H. Watada

**Background and aims:**
Autophagy is a conserved bulk degradation system essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by eliminating dysfunctional proteins and organelles. Autophagy also contributes to preserving pancreatic beta cell function and glucose tolerance, as shown in pancreatic beta cell-specific Atg7 knockout mice (Atg7- βKO). Atg7-βKO demonstrates glucose intolerance and insufficient insulin secretion at a young age. However, their long-term outcome has not yet been clarified, while other autophagy-deficient tissues lead to tumorigenesis, such as in the liver, or cell death in the cerebellum. We aim to study the changes in glucose tolerance in Atg7-βKO and the fate of pancreatic beta cells lacking autophagy.

**Materials and methods:**
We generated ATG7-βKO (Ins1-Cre- ERT and ­Atg7 ) mice by interbreeding Ins1-Cre-ERT and ­Atg7 mice, followed by tamoxifen injection at the age of 6 weeks. Ins1-Cre-ERT: ­Atg7 mice were used as controls after tamoxifen injection. We performed an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) every 4-5 weeks for more than one year, as well as histologi- cal analysis and single-cell RNA-seq analysis in pancreatic islets of the aged mice.

**Results:**
The Atg7-βKO mice showed glucose intolerance 6 weeks after tamoxifen injection (AUC in the IPGTT at the age of 11 weeks: control vs. Atg7-βKO, 32,910 ± 7115 vs. 55,638 ± 4382, arbitrary unit, p = 0.0038), as reported previously. Surprisingly, the impaired glucose tolerance in Atg7-βKO mice had recovered to the levels comparable to the control group at the age of 27 weeks (AUC in the IPGTT at the age of 27 weeks: control vs. Atg7-βKO, 49745 vs. 29390, arbitrary unit, p = 0.14). Furthermore, vacuoles in pancreatic beta cells in young Atg7- βKO mice, which suggests cellular degeneration, disappeared in the aged mice in histological analysis. Immunofluorescence microscopy for pancreatic islets confirmed a lack of Atg7 staining and accumulation of p62, a hallmark of impaired autophagy in young ATG7-βKO mice(12- 18 weeks after tamoxifen injection). However, no p62 aggregation was observed in aged ATG7-βKO mice (30 weeks or more after the injec- tion). The scRNA-seq analysis revealed that some clusters among pan- creatic beta cells robustly increased in aged Atg7-βKO mice compared to young ones, and those clusters included the cells expressing gluca- gon, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin in addition to insulin. The gene ontology analysis with Metascape identified the enrichment of proteins related to the ribosome (-Log (P)= 39.17) and oxidative phosphorylation(-Log (P)= 6.32) in the clusters.

**Conclusion:**
Our long-term observation in Atg7-βKO mice found that a lack of autophagy in pancreatic beta cells does not necessarily lead to their demise, and unknown mechanisms could compensate for their cellular dysfunction. We speculate that a degradation system other than Atg7-mediated conventional macroautophagy could compensate for the loss of bulk protein degradation, considering that accumulated p62 was eliminated in aged Atg7-βKO mice. On the other hand, the appearance of the beta cell clusters with polyhormonal features in aged Atg7-βKO mice suggests that the appearance of other endocrine cells than beta cells could contribute to the compensation for the dysfunc- tion in beta cells.

**Beta cell-specific AhR expression is critical to high-fat diet induced hyperinsulinaemia in mice**

M.E.A. Ching

**Background and aims:**
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that acts as an “environmen- tal sensor”, involved in responding to diverse stimuli ranging from environmental pollutants to high-fat diets (HFD). Rodent studies suggest global deletion protects against HFD-induced metabolic dysfunction, but little is known about the role of AhR in insulin- secreting pancreatic β-cells. To address this gap, we used a β-cell- specific knockout mouse model (βAhR ) to investigate the role of β-cell AhR in the early adaptation to HFD feeding.

**Materials and methods:**
We fed male and female βAhR mice and genotype controls (βAhR ) with 60% HFD or a matched 10% low-fat diet (LFD) for 7 days (n = 7-10 mice per group). We meas- ured body weight, fat mass, and fasting blood glucose on days 2 and 5, and performed a glucose tolerance test on day 7. We collected whole pancreas for histological assessments or isolated islets to assess β-cell function and islet gene expression. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05.

**Results:**
Both female and male HFD-fed mice, irrespective of geno- type, became glucose intolerant relative to LFD-fed mice but only βAhR mice exhibited HFD-induced hyperinsulinemia. There were no genotype-based differences in body weight gain, % fat mass, or fast- ing blood glucose levels following HFD feeding in either sex. There were also no differences in islet morphology or β-cell proliferation across all groups. However, when we assessed islet function , HFD-fed βAhR females oversecreted insulin in response to high glu- cose and KCl compared to LFD-fed βAhR females, whereas HFD- fed βAhR females had a normal glucose response and impaired KCl response compared to LFD-fed βAhR females. Islets from HFD-fed βAhR males exhibited impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared to LFD-fed βAhR males, while there were no differences in insulin secretion between HFD- and LFD-fed βAhR males. These data suggest that β-cell AhR is essential for proper insulin secretion and adaptation to HFD stress. We also observed genotype-based changes in insulin secretion and islet gene expression in LFD-fed mice, suggesting a basal role of AhR in β-cell function. βAhR male islets were less glucose-responsive thanβAhR male islets, despite βAhR male islets having slightly elevated expression of insulin pro- cessing ( ; 1.2-fold) and glucose sensing ( ; 1.4-fold) genes compared to βAhR islets. Furthermore, deleting β-cell AhR mod- estly altered the expression of oxidative stress response genes ( ) in both sexes.

**Conclusion:**
Collectively, these data provide novel evidence suggest- ing that β-cell AhR has a physiological role in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.

**SGLT2 inhibition mitigates glucotoxicity and suppresses m A RNA methylation defects in pancreatic islets in diabetic mice**

T. Kimura, imi, J. Sanada, M. Shimoda, S. Nakanishi, K. Kaku, H. Kaneto

**Background and aims:**
In pancreatic β-cells of type 2 diabetes, ­m A RNA methylation is impaired, leading to β-cell dysfunction and insulin signaling abnormalities, contributing to diabetes pathogen- esis. Glucotoxicity itself also causes methylation defects in pancre- atic islets. However, the impact of glucotoxicity avoidance on β-cell methylation has not been reported. This study aims to investigate the effect of SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated blood glucose improvement on RNA methylation in pancreatic islets in a diabetic mouse model, and to clarify the role of m6A RNA methylation in type 2 diabetes progression.

**Materials and methods:**
B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J mice were divided into two groups: one received the SGLT2 inhibitor luseogliflozin (Luseo) at 0.01%, the other received normal chow as a control (CTL) for 11 weeks, and were analyzed at 18 weeks of age. At the end of the inter- vention, expression of methylation-related genes in isolated pancreatic islets and insulin-related genes was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. In vitro, MIN6 cells were used to assess the impact of methyltransferase knockdown on GSIS, gene expression, and protein expression.

**Results:**
The Luseo group maintained lower blood glucose levels com- pared to the CTL group. Serum insulin levels were higher in the Luseo group. The GSIS in isolated pancreatic islets showed significantly stronger secretion under high glucose (16.7 mM) in the Luseo group compared to the CTL group. Insulin gene expression was higher in the Luseo group, and insulin transcription factors, such as MafA and Pdx-1, were also elevated in the Luseo group. On the other hand, methylation- induced enzymes (Mettl14, Mettl3), reader proteins (YTHDF2), and demethylase ALKBH5 were all expressed at higher levels in the Luseo group compared to the CTL group. To examine whether the mainte- nance of ­m A RNA methylation inhibits disease progression, in vitro experiments were conducted using MIN6 cells. In comparison to siScr, siMettl14+Mettl3 knockdown led to a 60% decrease in Mettl14 and Mettl3 gene expression. GSIS under high glucose conditions showed significantly lower secretion in the siMettl14+Mettl3 group compared to siScr. Notably, insulin, MafA, NeuroD, and Glut2 gene expres- sions were reduced, while Hes1 gene expression was increased in the siMettl14+Mettl3 group. Furthermore, cell cycle-related genes Ccnd2 and Cdk4 were significantly lower, while p21 was significantly higher in the siMettl14+Mettl3 group. Western blotting showed that MafA, Cdk4, CyclinD2, and pAKT protein expression were significantly lower in the siMettl14+Mettl3 group compared to siScr. To assess mRNA stability, MIN6 cells were cultured in the presence of actinomycin D, and mRNA expression of MafA, Glut2, and CDK4 was significantly decreased in the siMettl14+Mettl3 group over time.

**Conclusion:**
Luseogliflozin administration to db/db mice, preventing glucotoxicity, preserved high ­m A methylation in pancreatic islets. Methylation defects decreased mRNA stability of key genes involved in insulin biosynthesis and secretion, such as MafA and Glut2. These findings suggest that methylation defects in pancreatic islets contribute to type 2 diabetes progression.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity contributes significantly to type 2 diabetes by disrupting crosstalk between adipose tissue and pancreatic beta cells. We investigated how adipocyte-derived exosomes, particu- larly those carrying angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2), mediate beta cell dysfunction under lipotoxic stress.

**Materials and methods:**
Exosomes from palmitic acid (PA)-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were isolated, characterized by nanoparticle track- ing analysis and transmission electron microscopy, and then co-cul- tured with both MIN6 cells and primary mouse islets to assess prolif- eration, apoptosis, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). ANGPTL2 expression and transfer were manipulated via lentiviral transduction, GW4869-mediated exosome inhibition, and adipocyte- specific knockdown of ANGPTL2. ANGPTL2 interaction with EIF2α and activation of the ATF4/CHOP pathway were assessed using co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and Western blotting. In vivo, ANGPTL2 overexpression was induced via adeno-associated virus (AAV) in mice on normal or high-fat diets (HFD) to evaluate islet morphology and function.

**Results:**
PA-treated adipocytes produced exosomes enriched in ANGPTL2, which were effectively transferred to beta cells. Treatment with PA-derived exosomes impaired beta cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and suppressed GSIS. Mechanistically, ANGPTL2 directly interacted with EIF2α, enhancing its phosphorylation and triggering the ATF4/CHOP stress-response pathway, leading to beta cell dedi- fferentiation, characterized by downregulation of beta cell-specific markers (Pdx-1, Mafa, Nkx6.1) and upregulation of dedifferentia- tion markers (Aldh1a3, Ngn3). Primary mouse islets treated with ANGPTL2-enriched exosomes confirmed these detrimental effects. In vivo, AAV-mediated ANGPTL2 overexpression in beta cells exacerbated glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and beta cell dedifferentiation. Importantly, inhibition of exosome secretion using GW4869 effectively reversed ANGPTL2 transfer and attenuated beta cell dysfunction.

**Conclusion:**
Adipocyte-derived exosomal ANGPTL2 significantly contributes to lipotoxic beta cell dysfunction by directly activating the EIF2α/ATF4/CHOP stress-response pathway. Targeting exosomal ANGPTL2 represents a novel therapeutic strategy to preserve beta cell function and prevent obesity-associated type 2 diabetes progression.

**Background and aims:**
Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective treat- ment for severe obesity, leading to significant weight loss (WL) and metabolic improvement. However, patients with impaired- as compared to normal-glucose tolerance may experience less WL. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we aimed to assess if BS-induced gene expression changes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) may explain this blunted WL response in patients with altered glucose metabolism.

**Materials and methods:**
Seventy-eight women (age 25-65 years, BMI 39-49 kg/m²), without type 2 diabetes, undergoing BS were classified into two groups based on glucose metabolism status: impaired (n=35, IGT group) and normal glucose metabolism (n=43, NGT group). Gene expression profiling was performed in 11 samples from each group using microarray hybridization on SAT samples obtained intra-opera- tively, and at one-year post-surgery. Weight evolution was monitored for up to three years.

**Results:**
At baseline, women with IGT exhibited higher insulin levels, a greater prevalence of hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia compared to the NGT group. One year after surgery, these metabolic differences were no longer observed. However, gene expression profiles on SAT significantly differed between groups and this altered expression pattern persisted one year later. Subjects in the NGT group showed increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism after the procedure, a response not observed in the study group. This sustained SAT dys- function was associated with greater weight regain by the third year.

**Conclusion:**
Patients with impaired glucose tolerance exhibit a dif- ferential gene expression profile in subcutaneous adipose tissue prior to surgery, with a blunted response one year after. These molecular differences may explain the more pronounced weight regain observed in these patients.

**Background and aims:**
Excessive uptake of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) by lean tissues like skeletal muscle, liver, kidneys or heart not balanced by increased oxidation contributes to the development of insulin resistance (IR) and lean organ dysfunction. While exercise is commonly promoted to improve metabolic health and IR, its effects on NEFA fluxes remain understudied. This study assessed the acute and chronic effects of high-intensity interval exercise on organ-specific FA fluxes in individuals with prediabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Fourteen individuals with prediabetes (defined by at least one Diabetes Canada criteria or an oral glucose insulin sensitivity ≤360 ml/kg/min) were included in this trial (4 men, 10 women; mean age 59 [SD 8] years, weight 81.6 [16.1] kg, BMI 30.1 [4.5] kg/m²). Participants underwent three postprandial metabolic assessments: at baseline, 18-24h following an acute exer- cise bout, and after 12 weeks of exercise training (72h after the last exercise session). A liquid meal (859 Kcal, 33% lipids, 17% proteins, and 50% carbohydrates) containing [U-13C]-palmitate was admin- istered along with continuous intravenous infusion of [7,7,8,8-²H]- palmitate to label plasma fatty acids and VLDL triglycerides. VLDLs were isolated by ultracentrifugation. The concentrations of [U-13C]- and [7,7,8,8-²H]-palmitate-labeled VLDL triglycerides, as well as the concentration of palmitoleate in VLDLs (an indirect index of de novo lipogenesis), were measured by GC/MSMS in blood samples collected every hour. Dynamic positron emission tomography/com- puted tomography (PET/CT) with intravenous ­[ C]-palmitate was used to evaluate organ-specific adipose tissue-derived NEFA fluxes 60min after the meal. Hepatic fat fraction was assessed by MRI.

**Results:**
Neither a single exercise bout nor exercise training affected skeletal muscle, myocardium, kidney, subcutaneous and visceral adi- pose tissue NEFA fluxes. No change in postprandial insulinemia was noted. No change in VLDL-TG-PA16 was observed. The AUC of VLDL-palmitoleate decreased (-5893 [-11505 to -282] μM·360 min ¹, P<0.05) following chronic exercise. Hepatic fat content remained unchanged in response to either a single bout or exercise training.

**Conclusion:**
Neither a single exercise bout nor 12 weeks of high-inten- sity interval training altered organ-specific fatty acid flux or hepatic fat content in individuals with prediabetes. However, chronic exercise decreased VLDL-palmitoleate, suggesting a reduction in de novo lipo- genesis. These findings highlight a potential benefit on postprandial lipid metabolism independent of changes in hepatic fat content.

**Background and aims:**
The progression from obesity to type 2 dia- betes (T2D) varies among individuals, in part, due to the functional decline of adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) and the accumulation of senescent pre/adipocytes in the subcutaneous fat tissue. Long noncod- ing RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of senescence. We previously demonstrated that is the most upregulated lncRNA in APCs from obese individuals with T2D (O-T2D) and its expression is associ- ated with -1317 CpG hypomethylation at the promoter. Silencing reduces senescence and promotes cell cycle re-entry. In cancer cells, it has recently been reported that regulates senescence through its interactions with the scaffold attachment factor SAFA. The present study aimed at investigating the expression of and SAFA in APCs from obese individuals, stratified by glucose tolerance.

**Materials and methods:**
APCs were isolated from subcutaneous fat biopsies of non-obese (non-O; n=8), obese-NGT (O-NGT; n=8), obese-IGT (O-IGT; n=8), and obese-T2D (O-T2D; n=8) individuals. Gene and protein expression were assessed by qPCR and Western blot. knockdown was performed using siRNA assays. Con- ditioned medium (CM) from O-T2D and O-IGT APCs was collected after culturing the cells in serum-free DMEM/F12.

**Results:**
In APCs from O-T2D, expression was upregulated and associated with decreased SAFA gene expression and protein levels. Specifically, mRNA was reduced by 39% (p<0.001), 27% (p<0.01), and 17% (p<0.05) in APCs from O-T2D, O-IGT, and O-NGT compared to non-O individuals, respectively. These reduc- tions were accompanied by 63% (p<0.01), 65% (p<0.01), and 38% (p<0.05) decreased SAFA protein levels in APCs from O-T2D, O-IGT, and O-NGT compared to the non-O. The expression of pro-senescence genes downstream SAFA was also increased, including (1.8-fold; p<0.01 in O-T2D and O-IGT; p<0.05 vs. non-O), (2.4-fold; p<0.01 in O-T2D and 2.6-fold; p<0.05 in O-IGT vs. non-O), and (4.6- fold; p<0.05 in O-T2D vs. non-O, 3.0-fold; p<0.05 vs. O-NGT, and 2.7-fold; p<0.05 vs. O-IGT). Furthermore, silencing in O-T2D APCs led to a 1.5-fold (p<0.01) upregulation of and reversed its transcriptional effects on downstream genes, indicating that acts upstream SAFA. At the opposite, CM from obese O-IGT and O-T2D APCs, which was already found to upregulate expression, selectively reduced expression respectively by 22% (p<0.001) and 48% (p<0.001), in non-O APCs, suggesting that the regulation of expression is dependent on expression.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings identify a functional -SAFA axis modulating senescence in human APCs, which appears to represent an important node through which obesity-associated epigenetic alterations drive APC dysfunction and loss of regenerative potential.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic benefits of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), the most effective treatment for diabetes and obesity, has been attributed to rapid and accentuated nutrient flux, which varies across the spectrum of nutrient composition or hormonal profile. Here we sought to explore the effect of RYGB on prandial metabolomic profile in response to glucose vs. mixed glucose and protein ingestion with and without exogenous glucagon administration.

**Materials and methods:**
Six non-diabetic subjects with prior his- tory of RYGB and 6 BMI- and age-matched non-surgical con- trols (CN) were studied on 3 occasions: (1) oral glucose (50g) test (OGT), (2) oral glucose (50g)+protein test (50g) (OGPT), (3) oral glucose(50g)+protein(50g) test with iv glucagon infusion(2ng/kg/min) (OGPT+GCG). Plasma profile of amino acids (AAs), keto acids, TCA cycle metabolites and beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were measured by GC-mass spectrometry at 0, 60, 120, 180 min.

**Results:**
The fasting levels of hormones and metabolites were sim- ilar for RYGB and CN, except for phenylalanine and valine, which were higher in CN than GB. There was a strong positive correla- tion between fasting concentrations of glucagon and AA, branched chain AA (BCAA), were correlated in non-surgical control ­(R =0.55, Pvalue=0.001) but not in RYGB subjects. During OGT, non-operated subjects had lower average concentrations of glucagon but higher lev- els of leucine, phenylalanine, valine and of total AA. During OGPT, plasma concentrations of insulin, glucagon, and AAs, particularly alanine, lysine, threonine and BCAA, keto acids, were increased in both RYGB and CN, but TCA cycle metabolites, such as fumarate and succinate, decreased only in CN. Elevating systemic glucagon con- centrations by 2-3-fold during OGPT+GCG decreased AA, especially BCAA, in GB but not in CN. However, no difference with CT was observed after glucose+protein meal with or without glucagon infu- sion. The association between the average prandial concentration of glucagon and AA, particularly for BCAA, during OGT and OGOT was strong in CN; glucagon infusion, however, increased the relationship between glucagon and AAs in both groups.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings indicate that rerouting the gut following RYGB alters prandial AA kinetics as well as AAs response to increased systemic glucagon concentrations within physiological levels. The association between endogenous glucagon concentration and AA is weaker in GB but can be rescued by glucagon infusion.

**Background and aims:**
The glycemic and physiological impacts of weight cycling (WC) - cycle(s) of weight loss and regain - remains unclear. Obesogenic memory is established in the post-obese lean state, but WC exerts reported adverse, null, or even beneficial cardio- metabolic outcomes when compared to persistent obesity (PO). This variability is likely multifactorial, including different age-dependent impacts of WC. Here we hypothesized that post-weight-loss obesity (PWLO) affects glycemic control age-dependently, and tested the like- lihood this involves circadian disruption and dysregulated adipose- hypothalamus axis.

**Materials and methods:**
Young and mid-age male mice (7 weeks or 1y old, respectively) were subjected to a 15-week ad-libitum dietary intervention, wherein persistently lean (PL) and PO mice were fed nor- mal-chow or high-fat diets throughout, respectively. PWLO underwent one cycle of weight loss and regain, and late-onset obese (LO) were fed high-fat diet only during the second weight gain phase (weeks 11-15).

**Results:**
In young mice, obesogenic memory was documented by a steeper weight gain in PWLO mice during the second vs. the first weight gain phase (p <0.0001), also when compared to LO in week 11 (p<0.05) . By the end of the intervention, obese groups weighed simi- larly and were dysglycemic compared to PL, but only young PWLO mice exhibited further-impaired glucose tolerance compared to PO or LO. This was accompanied by enhanced adipose (though not other tested inflammatory genes) in PWLO (p<0.05). Additionally, young PWLO mice exhibited attenuated active/inactive-phase circa- dian oscillations of locomotion and energy expenditure (p<0.05). In contrast, mid-aged mice showed milder obesity-induced dysglycemia, a less pronounced circadian disruption, and reduced adipose tissue inflammatory response, with no further impairment in PWLO. How- ever, mid-aged PWLO exhibited greater hypothalamic inflammatory response (microgliosis and NFkB activation) compared to mid-aged PO.

**Conclusion:**
Our results reveal age-dependent impacts of WC on gly- cemic regulation: While young mice exhibit a heightened susceptibility to dysglycemia and circadian oscillation disruption, mid-aged mice display greater neuroinflammatory response to WC - a common human weight trajectory with unclear health impacts.

**Background and aims:**
Early disturbances in the storage of dietary fatty acids within adipose tissue are believed to be a key mechanism linking obesity to the onset of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, leading to an increased flux of dietary fatty acids towards lean organs. Exercise is known to improve peripheral insulin sensitivity, but its effects on organ-specific dietary fatty acid (DFA) flux remain unclear. Here, we investigated the acute and chronic effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on postprandial DFA metabolism in women and men with prediabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Individuals with prediabetes (14 women/5 men; mean age 59 [SD 9] years, weight 83.6 [14.6] kg, BMI 30.5 [4.1] kg/m ) participated in three postprandial metabolic protocols: (1) before, (2) 18-24h after a single session and (3) 48-72h after the last of 36 sessions of HIIT on an ergonomic bicycle. Prediabetes was defined by at least one of the following criteria: (i) fasting plasma glucose between 6.1 and 6.9 mmol/L, (ii) plasma glucose between 7.8 and 11.0 mmol/L 2h after ingestion of 75g glucose and a HbA1c between 6.0 and 6.4% or (iii) a glucose clearance rate based on OGTT ≤ 360 ml/kg/ min. Participants ingested a standard liquid meal (853 kcal; 50% carbo- hydrates, 33% lipids and 17% proteins) containing the long-chain fatty acid positron emission tomography (PET) tracer ­[ F]-FTHA. Whole- body PET scans were taken 6h after meal consumption to quantify tissue distribution of DFA.

**Results:**
No change was observed after a single exercise session in the retention of ­[ F]-FTHA in the intestine, heart, liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue depots (visceral and subcutaneous). In contrast, following 36 HIIT sessions, ­[ F]-FTHA retention in the intestine increased by 7.7% (95% CI: 0.8 to 14.7%, P=0.02) and decreased by 1.6% (95% CI: -2.8 to -0.3%, P=0.02) in lower body subcutaneous fat depots. When only considering bioavailable FTHA (i.e., accounting for intestinal retention), no differences were observed in DFA biodis- tribution across the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues.

**Conclusion:**
These results suggest that the intestines modulate the entry of DFA into the circulation in response to prolonged HIIT. How- ever, it remains unclear whether the DFA quantified in the intestines reflect its presence and retention in enterocytes for future appearance into circulation, increased intestinal fatty acid utilization or reduced absorption.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a major public health issue affecting nearly a quarter of Canadians in 2021 and is expected to reach one-third of the population by 2030. Bariatric surgery is one of the solutions to this issue, providing individuals with sustainable weight loss along with improvements in their quality of life and metabolic health. The aim of our study is to observe the early effects of sleeve gastrectomy on postprandial hepatic and cardiac dietary fatty acids (DFA) and non- esterified fatty acids (NEFA) metabolism in subjects with or without type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Subjects followed protocols before and 10 to 14 days after surgery. After a 12-hour fast, participants underwent hepatic MRI to determine the level of hepatic steatosis. Then, patients received an injection of ­[ C]-palmitate, a NEFA metabolism tracer, to assess hepatic and cardiac metabolism via positron emission tomog- raphy (PET) imaging. Finally, a liquid meal was ingested with a PET tracer, a long-chain fatty acid analog, ­[ F]-FTHA, to determine the distribution of DFA within organs over a 6-hour period post-meal.

**Results:**
So far, seven subjects (4M/3W), 3 without diabetes and 4 with diabetes or pre-diabetes, have completed the protocols. Par- ticipants lost approximately 8% of their body mass (144.6±12.4 vs. 133.0±11.9 kg, <0.02), 4% of their waist circumference (132.6±8.0 vs. 127.1±8.1 cm, <0.02) and nearly 43.5% of their intrahepatic fat fraction (n=5; 15.6±4.7 vs. 8.8±2.4%, =0.06), but not total body fat mass (69.6±6.2 vs. 67.9±8.4 kg, =0.58) 10 to 14 days after gastrec- tomy. While hepatic DFA uptake did not change (4.2±0.4 vs. 4.1±0.3 SUV [Standard Uptake Value]), the liver did take up 51.4% more NEFA (n=6; 216.7±33.0 vs. 328.2±31.9 μmol.min ¹, <0.04) with a significant increase in oxidative metabolism (n=6; 81.2±20.6 vs. 179.2±39.1 μmol.min ¹, <0.04) after surgery. On the other hand, both cardiac DFA (2.5±0.1 vs. 1.7±0.2 SUV, <0.05) and NEFA uptake (n=6; 157.2±31.6 vs. 110.3±16.3 μmol.min , P<0.09) were nearly 30% less after surgery, with marked decrease in oxidative metabolism (n=6, 151.6±31.1 vs. 41.6±15.0 μmol.min , <0.04).

**Conclusion:**
Our preliminary results show heterogeneous responses between hepatic vs. cardiac fatty acid metabolism, with increase vs. reduction of fatty acid uptake and oxidation, respectively. The accelera- tion of hepatic fatty acid oxidation clearly plays a role in rapid reduc- tion of liver fat content after sleeve gastrectomy.

**Background and aims:**
Previous studies have shown a strong associa- tion between visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. This study aims to evaluate the causal associations between VAT and T2D, including its subtypes, and identify the proteins mediating these associations.

**Materials and methods:**
Summary-level genome-wide associa- tion statistics for VAT, plasma proteins, prevalent T2D, and its sub- types were obtained from the UK Biobank (n=325,153), deCODE Genetics (n=35,559), the DIAGRAM consortium (n_case=80,154, n_control=853,816), and the Swedish ANDIS cohort (n_case=6,558, n_control=2,744), respectively. A two-sample Mendelian Randomi- zation (MR) analysis was conducted to assess the causal association between VAT and T2D. A proteome-wide MR analysis was conducted to identify T2D-associated proteins, with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. A two-step network MR analysis was conducted to con- struct a VAT-protein-T2D network. Gender and T2D subtypes—mild age-related diabetes (MARD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), and severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD)—were included in the analysis.

**Results:**
Our study suggested that VAT was causally associated with T2D in all individuals (OR=2.96, 95% CI: 2.73-3.20, 1.93×10 ), as well as in females (OR=3.26, 95% CI: 2.75-3.85, 3.56×10 ) and males (OR=2.41, 95% CI: 2.13-2.72, 1.07×10 ). A sig- nificant association was also found in individuals with MARD (OR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.07-2.09, 1.72×10 ), MOD (OR=6.66, 95% CI: 4.40-10.07, 2.73×10 ), SIDD (OR=3.60, 95% CI: 2.28-5.66, 3.20×10 ), and SIRD (OR=4.29, 95% CI: 2.79- 6.61, 3.67×10 ). However, sensitivity analysis did not support the VAT-MARD association. 56 proteins were associated with T2D ( _ FDR<0.05). Among these proteins, 12 proteins (TMEM108, ARRDC3, TNFAIP8, IGHG4, F8, STATH, RAB1A, DDC, CHST5, ICAM5, KCNE5, and PIANP) were identified as mediators of the VAT-T2D association. Specifically, RAB1A and CHST5 mediated the VAT-T2D association only in males, while TMEM108, F8, and DDC did so only in females. In addition, IGHG4 mediated the VAT-MOD and VAT- SIRD association. F8 and ICAM5 mediated the VAT-SIDD association.

**Conclusion:**
Our study identified specific proteins mediating the associations between VAT and T2D as well as its subtypes, offering a molecular framework to better understand T2D pathophysiology.

**Background and aims:**
Dumping syndrome is common after bariatric surgery, with factors like surgical procedure, rapid weight loss, and diet influencing its development. However, other factors may also play a role, and its clinical management remains challenging. This study aims to identify patient-specific and clinical factors already present before surgery that can identify individuals with an elevated risk of dumping syndrome following bariatric surgery.

**Materials and methods:**
Obese individuals scheduled for bariatric sur- gery (n=70, 14/56 male/female, body mass index [BMI] 45.6 ± 5.7 kg/ m², age 46.6 ± 10.3 years) were examined before and at 6 months after surgery. Dumping syndrome was assessed clinically using the Sigstad Score. Individuals were divided into two groups based on their Sigstad Score at six months after the bariatric surgery: group 1 with abnormal Sigstad Score ≥ 4 (n=26, 3/23 male/female) and group 2 with normal Sigstad Score < 4 (n=44, 11/33 male/female). BMI, waist-hip-ratio (WHR), routine blood parameters, parameters of glucose metabolism including fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin, c-peptide, the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, and bioelectrical impedance analysis were assessed. Baseline parameters and changes from baseline to after surgery were compared between the study groups, assessing also for sex differences.

**Results:**
Six months after surgery 21% of male and 41% of female Indi- viduals had an abnormal Sigstad Score. Female individuals with low Sigstad Score (0.4 ± 1.6) compared to those with high Sigstad Score (7.7 ± 4.2) had higher total bilirubin levels at baseline (0.56 ± 0.21 vs. 0.46 ± 0.15; P=0.047). Male individuals with low Sigstad Score (-0,4 ± 1.1) compared to those with high Sigstad Score (6.0 ± 1.7) showed higher fasting glucose levels at baseline (118.3 ± 14.8 vs. 98.0 ± 8.9; P=0.045) and lower baseline ALT levels (35.7 ± 15.6 vs. 79.0 ± 32.4; P=0.005). Furthermore, individuals who did not experience dumping syndrome after surgery had a 4.3% decrease of WHR from baseline (P=0.034), with females having a 3.4% decrease (P=0.097) and males a 6.9% decrease (P=0.028). WHR after surgery did not change in indi- viduals who experienced dumping syndrome (P=0.576).

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, preoperative factors such as sex, total bilirubin, fasting glucose, and ALT levels may serve as predictors for the risk of developing dumping syndrome following bariatric surgery. Additionally, reduction of visceral fat after surgery is associated with lower occurrence of dumping syndrome. These findings could contrib- ute for effective clinical assessment and management of obese individu- als undergoing bariatric surgery.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, contributing to increased mor- tality. Traditionally, obesity has been assessed using body mass index (BMI), but this method has limitations. This study aimed to evaluate A Body Shape Index (ABSI) as an alternative and complementary measure to BMI and waist circumference (WC) for predicting mortal- ity and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).

**Materials and methods:**
This study utilized data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS- NSC 2.0) covering the period from 2002 to 2019. A total of 586,886 participants were included in the analysis. Multiple Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression plots were generated to assess associations.

**Results:**
ABSI demonstrated a positive association with all-cause mor- tality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.38, 95% CI 1.328-1.424, p<0.001], with the highest risk observed in the fourth quartile (HR 1.212, 95% CI 1.126- 1.304, p<0.001). In contrast, BMI (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.944-0.956, p<0.001) and WC (HR 0.994, 95% CI 0.992-0.996, p<0.001) showed a negative association. The RCS plot revealed a J-shaped relationship between ABSI and all-cause mortality, with a sharp increase in HR beyond the midpoint of ABSI. Regarding MACCE, ABSI, BMI, and WC showed a positive association (HR 1.163, 95% CI 1.118-1.209, p<0.001 for ABSI; HR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.001, p=0.006 for BMI; HR 1.019, 95% CI 1.017-1.021, p<0.001 for WC). The RCS plot indi- cated a dose-dependent relationship between all obesity parameters and MACCE.

**Conclusion:**
ABSI is strongly associated with both all-cause mortality and MACCE, suggesting that it may serve as a superior predictor of clinical outcomes compared to BMI and WC in the general population, particularly in the context of the obesity paradox.

**Beyond BMI: validating iBMI and dBMI to define novel obesity clusters and stratify metabolic risk**

S.N. Shinde

**Background and aims:**
Conventional body mass index (BMI) does not consider central obesity, a key contributor to dysmetabolism and insulin resistance. To address this issue, we developed two derived indexes. 1. Improvised BMI (iBMI), defined as ((Weight × Waist Cir- cumference) / Height) with kg.cm/cm as units. 2. Differential BMI (dBMI = iBMI − BMI) with number as units. This study aimed to validate these indexes in identifying subjects with metabolic dysfunc- tion and to assess whether simple glycaemic markers, such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), could substitute for complex insulin metrics.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 300 subjects attending our life- style clinic were assessed. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and waist circumference) and metabolic parameters (FPG, fasting plasma insulin [FPI], HbA1c, and visceral fat via bioelectrical impedance) were recorded. HOMA-IR and HOMA-B were calculated. K-means clustering stratified subjects into healthy, intermediate, and unhealthy phenotypes based on key metabolic variables. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to evaluate the predictive value of BMI, iBMI, and dBMI.

**Results:**
The unhealthy cluster (n = 34, 11.3%) showed a significantly elevated mean FPG (225.1 mg/dL) compared to the healthy group (n = 170, 56.7%; FPG 109.5 mg/dL; p < 0.001). BMI values overlapped across clusters and showed weak correlation with metabolic risk mark- ers. In contrast, dBMI demonstrated stronger positive correlations with HOMA-IR (r = 0.22), visceral fat (r = 0.35), and an inverse corre- lation with HOMA-B. iBMI also aligned better with insulin metrics than BMI, but dBMI consistently outperformed both in identifying high-risk individuals. Based on cluster distribution, we propose pre- liminary iBMI thresholds: 50 or less (Normal), 51-60 (Overweight), 61-70 (Obese I), 71-85 (Obese II), and >85 (Obese III). The gradient of dBMI across clusters supported a cumulative risk interpretation. A combined glycaemic index using FPG and HbA1c z-scores further improved group separation (p < 0.00001), underscoring the utility of non-insulin markers in risk prediction.

**Conclusion:**
dBMI and iBMI integrate waist circumference into BMI logic and outperform conventional BMI in stratifying dysmetabolic risk. FPG alone, a widely available measure, is effective in differenti- ating high-risk individuals, particularly when combined with dBMI. These simple metrics can enhance population-level screening and clini- cal decision-making, especially in resource-limited settings where insu- lin assays are not feasible. Based on cluster-derived analysis, we propose preliminary iBMI thresholds to grade obesity severity in routine care. Pending broader validation, iBMI has the potential to replace BMI in clinical practice as a more metabolically meaningful measure.

**Background and aims:**
Weight-loss-inducing agents have shown indications of improvements in conditions such as knee osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis in persons with obesity. However, the sensitivity and dynamics of functional tests, such as the 20-meter walking test, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in persons with obesity and OA remain inadequately explored. This exploratory post-hoc analysis evaluates the efficacy of intra-articular placebo injections and the potential influence of BMI on the changes observed in the 20-meter walking test and commonly used PROMs.

**Materials and methods:**
This is a post-hoc analysis of a rand- omized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase II study comparing intra-articular injections of SB-061 with placebo (isotonic saline) over 52 weeks. A total of 288 subjects were randomized to SB-061 (n = 145) or placebo (n = 143), with 252 participants (87.5%) completing all injections. This subgroup analysis focuses on par- ticipants in the placebo group, examining the influence of baseline BMI on the 20-meter walking test, as well as perceived pain and functionality using WOMAC, Intermittent and Constant Osteoar- thritis Pain (ICOAP), and Patient Global Assessment (PGA) scores. Placebo participants were stratified into BMI subgroups (<25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40, and 40-45). Statistical analyses were conducted using a mixed-effects model with Dunnett correction at each time point (Weeks 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 52)

**Results:**
Baseline characteristics across BMI subgroups were com- parable on age, KL-score and with no significant differences in any of the main analysis parameters. Greater variability was observed in the 20-meter walking test compared to PROMs assessing pain, stiffness, and functionality, as measured by WOMAC, PGA, and ICOAP scores. After 52 weeks of intervention, significant reduc- tions in duration and step count for the 20-meter walking test were observed in BMI ranges 30-35 (p < 0.0001, p = 0.004) and 40-45 (p = 0.0014, p = 0.36), respectively, compared to baseline. Similarly, PROMs demonstrated significant reductions across all BMI ranges, except for near-significant reductions in WOMAC, PGA, and ICOAP for BMI 40-45 and ICOAP for BMI 35-40 (Table 1).

**Conclusion:**
Placebo injections improved the 20-meter walking test and PROMs, including WOMAC, ICOAP, and PGA scores, but the degree of improvement varied across BMI categories. PROMs appeared to be more sensitive to placebo injections across BMI ranges compared to functional performance metrics, like the 20-meter walking test. These findings could suggest that BMI may act as a confounding factor in evaluating the 20-meter walk- ing test and the PROMs for knee osteoarthritis, but requires further investigation.

**Aging, weight loss and glucose homeostasis: the metabolic influ- ence of CnAβ1**

B.M. Rubio

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes is a global health concern, with its incidence and complications increasing over time and with disease duration, potentially leading to additional comorbidities and reduced well-being in older patients. To counteract these trends, weight loss has become a key therapeutic priority in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A preliminary study was con- ducted linking variant to metabolic regulation. Loss-of-function of has been linked with lower serum levels of glucose, triglyc- erides, and cholesterol, as well as a lower body mass index (BMI) in humans. This study aims to establish the relationship between the loss-of-function of the calcineurin A alternative variant and improved metabolic function.

**Materials and methods:**
mice were generated by delet- ing the C-terminal domain specific to . Male and female mice (n=10) aged 3 to 18 months, along with control mice, were used. Animals were fed a normal diet (ND), and their body weight and food intake were monitored at 3, 12, and 18 months. Glucose toler- ance tests (GTT) and insulin tolerance tests (ITT) were performed. Additionally, serum glucose, insulin, and glucagon levels were meas- ured at t0 (ad libitum feeding), t1 (16-hours fasting), and t2 (1-hour refeeding after fasting) in 18-month-old mice. Metabolic cages were used to assess the average respiratory exchange ratio (RER), energy expenditure (EE), and activity levels before sacrifice.

**Results:**
mice exhibited lower body weight without signifi- cant differences in food intake. This sustained weight reduction was observed in both sexes compared to control mice (p < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for the GTT was significantly lower in 18-month-old mice (p < 0.05), whereas no differences were observed in the ITT, indicating a lower risk of hypoglycemia despite enhanced postprandial glucose uptake. A significant increase in insulin production was observed in mice at t0 (p < 0.05), with no differences at t1 and t2. Serum glucose and glucagon levels were lower at the three time points, although this decrease was not statistically significant compared to the control group. mice showed increased EE, which was not associated with higher activity levels, as their activity was significantly lower than that of the group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the RER in mice shifted from an average of 0.7 during the daytime to 0.9 at night, providing insights into substrate utilization changes in knockout animals.

**Conclusion:**
The loss-of-function of should be considered a rel- evant factor in the study of T2DM and obesity, as it promotes sustained weight loss and effective glucose regulation over time. Our findings suggest that deficiency enhances glucose homeostasis with- out increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, possibly through improved insulin secretion and postprandial glucose uptake. Additionally, the observed increase in energy expenditure, independent of physical activ- ity, highlights a potential role for in systemic metabolic regula- tion. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic control and suggest that targeting could represent a promising therapeutic approach for managing T2DM and obesity, particularly in aging populations.

**Background and aims:**
Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and diet- induced thermogenesis (DIT) are key components of daily energy expenditure that influence weight regulation and display considerable interindividual variability. Prior research has shown that low-protein overfeeding can differentiate metabolic phenotypes, with “thrifty” indi- viduals (weight-loss (WL) resistant) exhibiting a blunted DIT response compared to “spendthrift” individuals (WL susceptible). In the current study, we evaluated whether a low-protein meal test could similarly predict WL success after a long-term very-low-calorie-diet (VLCD) in a cohort of individuals with severe obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
20 patients with severe obesity (n=13 female; BMI mean 46.9±SD 6.9 kg/m ; Age 46±11 years; FM 53.5±6.5%; FFM 46.5±6.5%) from a 6-month multimodal obesity therapy program with a 12-week VLCD (35% protein, 41% carbohydrates, 25% fat) are included in the current study. At baseline, after a 3-day balanced diet and a 24-hour fast, RMR was measured using ventilated hood techniques and body composition was determined via air displace- ment plethysmography (BodPod). Patients then underwent a high- caloric, low-protein (1%) meal test individualized to 50% of measured RMR. Postprandial EE was recorded at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes, allowing for calculation of DIT, as mean postprandial EE minus RMR, and the incremental area under the curve (iAUC), both in kcal/3h. Patients then initiated the VLCD (800 kcal/day), including weekly body weight and monthly fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) recordings.

**Results:**
Mean DIT during the low-protein meal test was 17.7±13.4 kcal/3h. After 12 weeks of VLCD, mean WL was 18.7 kg (−13.4% from baseline), mean FM loss was 16.3 kg (−22.2%), and mean FFM loss was 1.1 kg (−2.2%). Higher DIT correlated with greater WL (r=0.55, p=0.01) and FM loss (r=0.56, p=0.01), but not with FFM loss (p=0.61). After adjustment for sex, age, FM, FFM, and consumed calories, DIT still significantly predicted WL and FM loss, but not FFM loss, such that 10 kcal/3h higher DIT was associated with -1,7 kg more WL (p=0.005, ) and -1,7 kg more FM loss (p=0.02). Similar results were obtained using iAUC.

**Conclusion:**
Higher DIT after a high-caloric low-protein meal was a significant predictor of successful weight and FM reduction after a 12-week VLCD in our cohort with severe obesity. These results sug- gest that a low-protein meal challenge may serve as an effective tool for predicting the outcomes of calorie-restriction treatments, thereby facilitating tailored interventions and personalized approaches to obe- sity therapy.

**Background and aims:**
In the SELECT trial of people with over- weight or obesity and established cardiovascular disease but no diabe- tes, a 73% reduction in new onset biochemical diabetes (HbA1c ≥6.5%) was observed with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist sema- glutide versus placebo (HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.24, 0.31; p<0.0001). Here, we report data on the addition during SELECT of medications known to lower glucose (GLM).

**Materials and methods:**
We compared time to post-randomisation ini- tiation of additional GLM in people randomised to weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg (n=8799) or placebo (n=8795) using Cox regression; excluding 10 people randomised in SELECT without documented ­HbA <6.5% at baseline. We conducted similar analyses within subgroups defined by history of heart failure (HF) at baseline. Among 1236 people initiating additional GLM, comparisons between arms used t tests and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.

**Results:**
GLM were initiated in 363/8799 people (4.1%) on semaglu- tide and 873/8795 people (9.9%) on placebo. Though significant, the treatment effect on the initiation of additional GLM (HR 0.40 [0.35, 0.45]; p<0.0001) was attenuated compared with the treatment effect on biochemical diabetes. Concordance between biochemical diabetes and initiation of new GLM was low overall and lower in the semaglutide vs placebo arm: in 1236 people receiving additional GLM, ­HbA ≥6.5% was observed in 76/363 (21%) on semaglutide and 401/873 (46%) in the placebo arm. In exploratory analyses among people initiating addi- tional GLM, a baseline history of HF was prevalent in 166 of 363 peo- ple (46%) on semaglutide and 296/873 (34%) on placebo (p=0.0001). The added GLM in the semaglutide arm also more often included sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is; 213/363 [59%] vs placebo 332/873 [38%]; p=0.0001). In people without a baseline history of HF (6643 semaglutide; 6663 placebo), the treatment effect on time to initiation of additional GLM (HR 0.33 [0.28, 0.39]) was similar to results previously reported for biochemical diabetes, whereas among people with a baseline history of HF (2155 semaglutide; 2129 placebo), the treatment effect was markedly attenuated (HR 0.52 [0.43, 0.63]; interaction p=0.0003). A higher proportion of people had perma- nently discontinued blinded therapy with semaglutide compared with placebo (42% vs 23%; p<0.0001) before additional GLM was initiated, though at their most recent study visit prior to initiation of additional GLM, people in the semaglutide arm had lower ­HbA (mean±SD: 5.84±0.64% vs placebo 6.29±0.79%; p<0.0001).

**Conclusion:**
Treatment with semaglutide was associated with a lower rate of additional GLM prescription than placebo, though not to the magnitude of semaglutide’s effect on hyperglycaemia. As addition of GLM most often occurred while still on blinded therapy and while study measurements suggested acceptable glycaemic control, interpret- ing use of any added GLM as a surrogate for the need for glycaemic control in a population without diabetes at baseline may be heavily influenced by protopathic or indication bias, which in turn appears especially associated with SGLT2i use in people with HF.

**Cisplatin induces long-term dysglycaemia in high-fat diet-fed male mice, but not females**

L. Basu, J.E. Bruin

**Background and aims:**
Previous research has shown that cancer survi- vors have an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes compared to the general population. A growing body of evidence suggests chemotherapy may be a driving factor in this relationship. Our group has previously reported adverse effects of cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent, on mouse pancreatic islet function and up to 2 weeks post- exposure . The goal of the current study is to characterize how cisplatin impacts long-term islet function in the presence of metabolic stress in mice.

**Materials and methods:**
Male and female mice were fed either a standard chow diet or 45% high-fat diet (HFD) for 3 weeks prior to being injected with 2 mg/kg/day cisplatin or saline (vehicle) every other day for 2 weeks. This resulted in 4 treatment groups for each sex: vehicle-chow, vehicle- HFD, cisplatin-chow, and cisplatin-HFD (n=12/sex/treatment group). Mice were then tracked for 4 months following this exposure period while continuing to be maintained on either chow or HFD. Monthly intraperito- neal glucose and insulin tolerance tests were conducted to track changes in metabolic health. At the end of the study, pancreatic islets were iso- lated from mice for qPCR (n=5-7/sex/treatment); intact pancreas tissues were harvested from a different subset of mice (n=4-5/sex/treatment) for paraffin-embedding and immunofluorescence staining.

**Results:**
For all results, significant findings were defined by <0.05. At 1 week post-exposure, cisplatin-chow males were significantly hypergly- cemic and had lower glucose-stimulated plasma insulin levels compared to vehicle-chow males. However, this phenotype was transient and largely resolved within 1 month post-exposure. Interestingly, cisplatin-HFD male mice were consistently less glucose intolerant than vehicle-HFD males between 1-3 months post-exposure. Cisplatin-HFD male mice had sig- nificantly lower glucose-stimulated plasma insulin levels and increased insulin-sensitivity compared to vehicle-HFD males for the duration of the study. In fact, cisplatin-HFD males had comparable plasma insulin levels and insulin sensitivity to vehicle-chow males. Yet, both HFD- fed groups were glucose intolerant compared to vehicle-chow males at all time points. Cisplatin-chow and cisplatin-HFD female mice did not differ in glucose tolerance, plasma insulin levels, or insulin sensitivity compared to vehicle-chow and vehicle-HFD female mice, respectively, throughout the study. Islets isolated from cisplatin-HFD male mice had significantly increased mRNA expression compared to islets from vehicle-HFD male mice. Cisplatin exposure led to an overall decrease in both and mRNA in islets from male mice, irrespective of diet. Histological analyses revealed that vehicle-HFD male mice had increased beta cell area and islet size compared to vehicle-chow males. This adaptation was not seen in cisplatin-HFD males. Islets isolated from female mice showed an overall increase in islet size in both vehicle-HFD and cisplatin-HFD mice compared to chow-fed females, but no differences in overall beta cell or alpha cell area between treatment groups. However, there was an overall upregulation of mRNA levels in cisplatin-exposed female mice.

**Conclusion:**
Taken together, our data suggests cisplatin exposure com- bined with HFD-feeding significantly disrupts long-term metabolic func- tion in mice, and shows lasting effects on islet function, especially in males.

**Background and aims:**
Estrogen, the primary female sex hormone, plays an essential role in maintenance of glucose and energy homeo- stasis. In the postmenopausal state, estrogen deficiency increases the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The central and peripheral actions of estrogen contribute to the regulation of energy metabo- lism; however, the mechanism underlying the regulation of glucose metabolism remains unclear. We have previously identified orexin, a hypothalamic neuropeptide, as a potent central regulator of glucose metabolism through the autonomic nervous system. Since estrogen has been reported to indirectly activate orexin neurons, estrogen and orexin may cooperate to maintain glucose homeostasis in the brain. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed changes in glucose toler- ance in the absence and presence of estrogen and/or orexin using mice lacking these factors.

**Materials and methods:**
Ovariectomized (OVX), gene knock- out ( ), and OVX- female mice were used as animal models lacking estrogen, orexin, or both, respectively. In the experi- ment for estrogen supplementation, estradiol (E2) was intracerebroven- tricularly (i.c.v.) administered with osmotic minipump. Glucose tol- erance tests were conducted under the aged (>10 months of age) or high-fat diet-induced obese conditions.

**Results:**
Under the aged conditions, OVX and mice showed impaired glucose tolerance, indicating that estrogen and orexin are both required for maintaining glucose homeostasis. However, endog- enous estrogen did not affect glucose tolerance in the absence of endogenous orexin, because OVX- and sham-operated (sham)- mice showed similar glucose tolerance. In contrast, glucose intolerance in OVX- mice was worse than that in OVX-wild- type ( ) mice, although insulin secretion and body weight were comparable between them. Thus, orexin prevented age-related impair- ments of glucose tolerance even in the absence of endogenous estrogen, suggesting that orexin is a downstream regulator of central estrogen effects on glucose metabolism. Under the diet-induced obese condi- tions, the rank order of glucose intolerance was OVX- >OVX- =OVX- mice. When E2 (i.c.v.) was supplemented, glucose intolerance was improved in OVX- but not OVX- mice in the obese state. These results also indicate that estro- gen improved glucose tolerance in an orexin-dependent manner, while orexin improved it without estrogen. Regarding the mechanism of the orexin’s actions, aged female mice showed more intense hepatic glucose production than mice. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated abnormal gene expressions related to transla- tion, transcription, and regeneration in the liver of OVX- mice, when compared to OVX- mice. Thus, the orexin system that acts downstream of estrogen contributed to maintenance of hepatic glucose homeostasis.

**Conclusion:**
The present study demonstrated that the beneficial central effects of estrogen on glucose metabolism were mediated by the orexin system in the brain. Therefore, the estrogen-orexin neural pathway may be a crucial target to prevent postmenopausal metabolic disorders, including diabetes.

**Deletion of ADAR2 improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sen- sitivity in obese mice by enhancing Glut2 localisation to cytomem- brane in pancreatic beta cells**

Y.-W. Chen

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus is one of the most severe chronic metabolic diseases worldwide, giving rise to tissue damage and secondary complications. Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, cata- lyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), is an important post-transcriptional modification of genome-encoded RNA transcripts. Three vertebrate ADAR gene family members, ADAR1, ADAR2 and ADAR3, have been identified. However, the functional role of ADAR2 in pancreatic β-cell functions under metabolic stress poorly understood.

**Materials and methods:**
­ADAR2 /GluR-B mice (wild type [WT]) and ­ADAR2 /GluR-B mice (ADAR2 knockout [KO]) were used to investigate the roles of ADAR2 in regulation of glucose homeostasis and pancreatic β cell function during the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The glucose metabolic phenotypes, β-cell mass, and β-cell functions were analyzed in the mouse models.

**Results:**
HFD-fed ADAR2 KO mice showed lower body weight when compared with HFD-fed WT mice. ADAR2 KO mice displayed protec- tion against HFD-induced glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. HFD-fed ADAR2 KO mice had a lower fasting plasma glucose and insulin level when compared to HFD-fed WT mice. HFD-fed ADAR2 KO mice displayed better insulin secretion in response to L-arginine when compared to HFD-fed WT mice. We observed that ADAR2 was mainly localized with β cells, but not other endocrine cells in islets. Pancreas weight, β-cell mass, the mean islet size, and endocrine mass of HFD-fed ADAR2 KO mice were smaller than that of HFD-fed WT mice. ADAR2 deficiency enhanced the second phase of insulin secre- tion in mice fed with HFD. ADAR2 deficiency enhanced Glut2 locali- zation to cytomembrane in pancreatic β cells of obese mice.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that ADAR2 may serve as a pos- sible therapeutic target in pathological processes.

**Background and aims:**
Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) secreted from the liver and the small intestine has gained interest as a ghrelin receptor antagonist. Recently, we reported glu- cose-lowering effects of i.v. infusion of LEAP2 during a liquid mixed meal test in lean men and men with obesity. Here, we investigated the effects of an i.v. LEAP2 infusion on the hepatic metabolic rate of glucose assessed by total-body positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) scan in men with obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
Nine men with obesity (mean age 36 (SD 9.4) years; BMI 36.8 (SD 3.28) kg/m2; waist-hip ratio 1.1 (SD 0.1); HbA1c 34 (SD 2.8) mmol/mol)) were enrolled in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study comprising two experimental days each involving a 145-minute i.v. infusion of LEAP2 (40 pmol/kg/min) or placebo (saline 9 mg/ml). Sixty minutes after infusion start, a low-dose glucose infusion (2 mg/kg/min) was initiated. Seventy-five minutes after infusion start, participants were injected with a glucose analogue (2-[ F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) and scanned in a Biograph Vision Quadra total-body PET/CT scan- ner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) for 70 minutes. Glu- cose net influx rates (ml/(ml×min)) and metabolic rates of glucose (μmol/(g×min)) were assessed using the Patlak method.

**Results:**
Compared to placebo, LEAP2 infusion did not affect the AUC for plasma glucose during the low-dose i.v. glucose infusion (mean 502 (SD 29.6) (LEAP2) vs 513 (SD 45.8) (placebo) mmol/ l×min, =0.3). LEAP2 infusion did not affect the hepatic metabolic rate of glucose (mean 0.019 (SD 0.011) (LEAP2) vs 0.017 (SD 0.011) (placebo) μmol/g×min, =0.7) or glucose net influx rates in skeletal muscle or brain compared to placebo.

**Conclusion:**
We observed no effect of continuous i.v. LEAP2 infu- sion on hepatic metabolic rate of glucose or glucose influx rates compared to placebo in fasted men with obesity receiving a continu- ous low-dose glucose infusion.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes and obesity, often driven by high- calorie diets, contribute to metabolic disorders where insulin resistance is a key factor. Along the disease trajectory, there is a compensatory mechanism to counter this resistance, leading to hyperinsulinemia. Moreover, effectiveness of insulin hinges on its binding to the insulin receptor (InsR), key in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Insulin is a key player in the intra-organ communication necessary for metabolic flexibility. In the last couple decades, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained notoriety in communication and signaling, since they are able to transport biomolecules protected by a lipid bilayer. EVs have been shown to regulate metabolism by counteracting dysmetabolism, includ- ing insulin resistance. Here, we hypothesize that EVs released by the liver, which plays a key role in regulating circulating insulin levels trough insulin clearance, act as signalling carriers to skeletal muscle and are crucial to maintain glucose homeostasis.

**Materials and methods:**
EVs isolated from human blood samples were analyzed for their insulin content in individuals with normogly- cemia and prediabetes in a preliminary study (n=6). To investigate the role of circulating and liver derived EVs (Liver-EVs), EVs were col- lected from mice fed either a normal chow diet (NCD) or a high-caloric diet (HCD) for 12 weeks to model a prediabetic/obese phenotype. The isolated EVs were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blot for established markers. To evaluate the functional impact of Liver-EVs on skeletal muscle, differentiated L6 myotubes were treated with Liver-EVs derived from NCD or HCD mice. The metabolic effects of these Liver-EVs on skeletal muscle cells were further elucidated using targeted metabolomics analysis.

**Results:**
We observed that plasma EVs from both humans and mice carry insulin on their surface, accounting for up to 25% of total cir- culating insulin in the prediabetic state. To further investigate the role of Liver-EVs in prediabetes, we found that these EVs also display the insulin receptor (InsR) on their surface. Notably, this surface localiza- tion renders InsR accessible for ligand binding. When the myotubes were exposed to InsR-enriched Liver-EVs, glucose uptake increased significantly, indicating that Liver-EVs may influence glucose metabo- lism in skeletal muscle tissue. Metabolomic profiling revealed a subtle shift in the metabolic signature of these myotubes treated with Liver- EVs, which became even more pronounced when cells were stimulated with insulin, revealing a modulation of insulin action by the EVs.

**Conclusion:**
We propose a compensatory mechanism in which, dur- ing prediabetes, Liver-EVs induce a metabolic shift in skeletal muscle cells, facilitating the cross talk between the two organs. This interaction enhances the muscle’s ability to maintain glucose homeostasis.

**Background and aims:**
Postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia (HH) is a serious complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) that may lead to loss of consciousness and seizures. The exact mecha- nism of postprandial HH after RYGB is poorly understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed, such as beta cell expansion, altered islet function or inappropriate gut hormone release. In this study, we aimed to investigate differences in beta cell mass between individu- als with and without postprandial HH after RYGB using ­[ Ga]Ga- NODAGA-exendin-4 PET/CT imaging.

**Materials and methods:**
Individuals with severe postprandial HH (n=10, 8 female; age 40.5 ± 8.7 years; BMI 28.9 ± 3.4 kg/m²) and without HH (n=9, 7 female; age 47.0 ± 4.0 years; BMI 27.9 ± 4.8 kg/m²) after RYGB were included in the study. All participants were injected with 102 ± 6.9 MBq of the ­[ Ga]Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 tracer and underwent PET/CT imaging to quantify pancreatic beta cell mass reflected by the total pancreatic tracer uptake (kBq/MBq) adjusted for injected dose and decay.

**Results:**
The two groups did not differ with respect to sex, age, BMI before RYGB, BMI after RYGB and total body weight loss. Time between RYGB surgery and inclusion was significantly longer for indi- viduals with HH after RYGB compared to those without (4.8 ± 1.9 vs 2.5 ± 0.7 years, p=0.0043). Although individuals with postprandial HH after RYGB had a smaller pancreas than those without HH (71.6 ± 13.7 vs 94.9 ± 23.1 ml, p=0.022), beta cell mass did not differ between individuals with and without postprandial HH after RYGB (4.7 ± 1.5 vs 5.3 ± 1.9 kBq/MBq, p=0.47). Beta cell mass correlated neither with body weight parameters, like BMI (r=-0.23, p=0.36), nor with metabolic parameters, such as ­HbA (r=0.059, p=0.82) and fasting glucose (r=-0.038, p=0.12).

**Conclusion:**
Our data indicate that expansion of beta cell mass does not explain severe postprandial HH after RYGB, since beta cell mass did not differ between the groups. Dysfunctional insulin secretion of beta cells may explain postprandial HH after RYGB, which requires further elucidation in future studies.

2. den, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala,

**Background and aims:**
Weight-lowering interventions improve metabolic homeostasis. Obesity surgery (OS) leads to metabolic improvements that seem at least partly independent of weight loss and are mediated also by the brain and several endocrine axes. Meta- bolic homeostasis cannot be fully addressed in the fasting state only, therefore metabolic challenges are warranted to display the metabolic effects of weight interventions. For the first time, we compared the short-term effects of weight loss achieved by either OS or a low-energy diet (LED) on several hormonal systems, at fasting and upon an oral glucose challenge.

**Materials and methods:**
This study presents sub-analyses from a rand- omized controlled trial including 24 participants with obesity but with- out diabetes (BMI 35-45 kg/m ), randomized 2:1 to either OS (n=15, gastric bypass n=11, sleeve gastrectomy n=4) or 4-week LED (n=9) leading to comparable weight loss at the 4-week follow-up. Circulating levels of gut, pituitary, adrenal, thyroid hormones, glucagon, insulin- like growth factor-1, and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured at baseline and 4 weeks after either intervention, both at fasting and during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

**Results:**
At 4 weeks, similar weight loss was achieved for the two interventions (7.7 for OS vs. 7.4 % for LED, p=0.70). GLP-1 and PYY secretion during the OGTT increased after OS (p<0.001 for OGTT​ for both hormones), but not LED, while glucagon secre- tion remained unaffected by either intervention. ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin levels during OGTT were increased after OS (p=0.04, p<0.001, p=0.002, respectively), while parathyroid hormone levels were decreased at fasting (p=0.015) and during the OGTT (p=0.001). Fasting triiodothyronine (T3) levels were reduced after OS (p=0.01). Fasting SHBG levels decreased after both interventions (both p<0.01). In the whole cohort, changes in fasting T3 after intervention correlated with changes in HbA1c (rho=0.439 p=0.032). Pre-intervention fast- ing T3 levels correlated with the post-intervention change in fasting glucose (rho=-0.557, p=0.003), while pre-intervention fasting PYY levels correlated with weight and BMI loss (rho=-0.411, p=0.046; rho=-0.488, p=0.016, respectively).

**Conclusion:**
Despite similar weight loss, rapid and extensive hormonal changes occur after OS, but not LED. Few differences were seen in the fasting state whereas multiple endocrine pathways were affected during the oral glucose challenge. The findings suggest altered glucose responses after OS in different tissues, including the pituitary gland and potentially the hypothalamus.

**Background and aims:**
White adipose tissue (WAT) is anatomically classified into subcutaneous and visceral depots, each playing distinct roles in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. These differences are driven by intrinsic cellular characteristics, including insulin sensitivity and inflammatory potential. However, the developmental mechanisms underlying such divergence remain poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed that subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes share a com- mon embryonic origin in the posterior lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), but follow distinct developmental routes through somatic and splanch- nic mesoderm, respectively. In this study, we aimed to recapitulate these lineage-specific developmental processes using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and to investigate how mesodermal origin influences the characteristics of differentiated white adipocytes.

**Materials and methods:**
Human iPSCs were sequentially differenti- ated into somatic and splanchnic mesoderm. These mesodermal cells were subjected to an identical three-stage white adipocyte differentia- tion protocol. Gene expression and differentiation efficiency at each stage were evaluated by immunocytochemistry, RT-qPCR, and West- ern blotting. Lineage-specific transcriptomic profiles of the resulting adipocytes were assessed by bulk RNA sequencing, and functional differences were further investigated.

**Results:**
Using established protocols, iPSCs were guided through the primitive streak to LPM. Optimization of Wnt signaling enhanced the expression of the posterior marker HOXB6. Subsequent induc- tion yielded either somatic or splanchnic mesoderm. Both lineages efficiently differentiated into white adipocytes, particularly under 3D scaffold conditions. The resulting cells exhibited unilocular lipid drop- lets and expressed mature adipocyte markers, consistent with func- tional white adipocytes. Even at the terminal differentiation stage, adipocytes retained differential expression of several lineage-specific developmental genes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct expres- sion profiles between subcutaneous- and visceral-lineage adipocytes. Visceral-lineage adipocytes showed enrichment of inflammatory genes and FOXO1 targets, suggesting a transcriptomic profile associated with insulin resistance. This was functionally supported by reduced insulin- stimulated AKT phosphorylation.

**Conclusion:**
We established the first human iPSC-derived white adipo- cyte models that recapitulate the developmental origins of subcutane- ous and visceral adipocytes. Our findings suggest that mesodermal line- age plays a critical role in determining both the molecular phenotype and functional properties of adipocytes. This model system provides a valuable tool to explore developmental contributions to WAT hetero- geneity and metabolic disease mechanisms.

**Background and aims:**
The skeleton is a key endocrine organ that secretes IGF2, which affects the browning of white adipocytes. This study aims to create myeloid-specific knockout mice to investigate how marrow IGF2 deficiency inhibits white adipose tissue browning and induces insulin resistance.

**Materials and methods:**
A conditional myeloid-specific knock- out mouse model ( ) was created using Cre-LoxP with LysM- Cre mice. Metabolic cages, IPGTT, and ITT were used to compare metabolic parameters between and control mice. H&E, Oil Red O, UCP1 immunofluorescence, ELISA, and RT-qPCR assessed fat deposition and browning marker genes. Transcriptomic sequencing was performed on bone marrow macrophages and white adipocytes. In HFD-induced obesity mice, exogenous IGF2 was administered via micro-osmotic pump to observe metabolic changes and adipose tissue browning. Golgi-IP with mass spectrometry identified altered traffick- ing proteins. IGF2’s effect on IGF2R localization was studied using pH-responsive IGF2R and confocal microscopy, with results confirmed by flow cytometry using CD222.

**Results:**
mice exhibited increased weight gain, reduced energy expenditure, and impaired glucose tolerance compared to con- trols. They also had increased lipid deposition in peripheral tissues, larger white adipose tissue, and fewer UCP1-positive cells, indicat- ing inhibited adipose tissue browning. Transcriptomic sequencing revealed changes in genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, and energy expenditure in bone marrow macrophages and white adipo- cytes after knockout. Exogenous IGF2 treatment partially reversed metabolic disorders and fat browning inhibition in obese mice. Mass spectrometry after Golgi-IP showed that IGF2 knockdown reduced cathepsin transport, especially Cathepsins D. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed that IGF2 knockdown inhibited IGF2R transport from the Golgi apparatus to endosomes.

**Conclusion:**
The absence of IGF2 in marrow cells inhibits white adi- pose tissue browning by blocking IGF2R transport of CTSD from the golgi apparatus to lysosomes, causing obesity and insulin resistance.

**Osteoprotegerin regulates adipose browning and energy metabo- lism via mTOR-raptor signalling in diet-induced obesity**

Q. Zhao

**Background and aims:**
Osteoprotegerin (OPG) acts as a decoy recep- tor of receptor activator of nuclear factor-B (RANKL) and has been identified as a critical regulator of adipose tissue metabolism. How- ever, the role of OPG in adipocyte browning and energy homeostasis remains to be elucidated. Our study aims to investigate the involvement of OPG in adipose browning in obesity and to explore its potential mechanisms in energy metabolism.

**Materials and methods:**
Herein, we evaluated circulating OPG levels in people with obesity, and investigated OPG expression patterns in adipose tissue from obesity mouse models. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to uncover clues pertaining to OPG and adipose tis- sue metabolism. Furthermore, the effects and underlying mechanisms of both silencing and overexpressing OPG on adipose browning and energy metabolism were elucidated in both animal models and cultured cells.

**Results:**
In the current study, we observed that circulating OPG lev- els were significantly elevated in individuals with obesity and insulin resistance (IR), and a positive correlation was identified between OPG levels and various indicators related to obesity and IR. Additionally, OPG expression was found to be markedly increased in the white adi- pose tissue (WAT) of obese mice, correlating with metabolic dysfunc- tion. Global OPG knockout ­(OPG ) mice exhibited reduced adiposity, elevated energy expenditure, and improved insulin sensitivity under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions, accompanied by the upregulation of uncoupling (UCP1) expression and the downregulation of adipocyte protein 2 (AP2) expression in inguinal WAT (iWAT). OPG deletion amplified β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) agonist-stimulated ther- mogenesis, as evidenced by increased oxygen consumption and heat production in vivo and UCP1 expression in iWAT. Conversely, adipose- specific OPG overexpression inhibited these effects. Mechanistically, OPG suppressed adipose browning by attenuating mTOR (Raptor)- S6K signaling, as demonstrated by the increased phosphorylation of mTOR, Raptor, and S6K in ­OPG mice. Notably, Rapamycin treatment or Raptor deletion abolished the OPG deficiency-induced upregula- tion of thermogenic genes (e.g., UCP1 and PGC-1α) and disrupted the interaction between Raptor and PGC-1α, which is critical for tran- scriptional activation. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation analyses confirmed the role of OPG in modulating the binding between Raptor and PGC-1α, with downstream effects on YY1 transcriptional activity.

**Conclusion:**
Our study has revealed that OPG functions as a negative regulator of adipose browning and energy metabolism via mTOR-Rap- tor-S6K signaling, offering novel insights into therapeutic strategies for obesity and metabolic disorders.

**Background and aims:**
Weight cycling is an increasingly prevalent weight trajectory with controversial health impact. Here we studied the molecular, cellular and functional impacts of weight cycling on adipose tissue obtained from women with a revisional bariatric surgery and a documented ≥15% weight loss after a prior surgery (post weight-loss obesity, PWLO), compared to women with primary bariatric surgery and persistent obesity (PO).

**Materials and methods:**
Subcutaneous (hSAT) and omental (hVAT) adipose tissues were studied histologically, and by bulk-RNA seq to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways. Deconvolution algorithm (sNucConv) was applied to estimate changes in cellular com- position. Functionally, we measured secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and CCL2 from adipose tissue explants, and the ability of adipose tissue condi- tioned medium to activate cultured human microglia cell-line (HMC3).

**Results:**
In a cohort consistent of n=51 PO and n=22 PWLO, the lat- ter trended to be older and with somewhat lower BMI. Histologically, we did not detect major changes between the groups, yet, bulk-RNA seq analysis revealed global transcriptome differences between PO vs. PWLO (in a sub-cohort of n=19) in hSAT. Estimated cellular composi- tion did not demonstrate marked cell composition changes, with only a trend towards higher percentage of endothelial cells. Analyzing ~200 DEGs uncovered clear enrichment in pro-inflammatory pathways in PWLO, many implicated in obesity-induced insulin resistance. hSAT adipose tissue conditioned media had higher secreted concentrations of of IL-6 and IL-8 in PWLO vs. PO. Moreover, PWLO whole hSAT conditioned media activated HMC3 cells, manifesting by increased microglial IL-6 secretion.

**Conclusion:**
These findings reveal that weight cycling not only increases inflammatory state of hSAT, but also potentially promotes a more pro-inflammatory paracrine/endocrine effect.

**Background and aims:**
Catecholamines are endogenous stimula- tors of β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) which hydrolyze triglycerides into fatty acids in white adipose tissue (WAT) through activation of cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. However, desensitization of βARs by obesity causes catecholamine resistance, resulting in impaired lipolytic activity and low lipid storage capacity. Increased fluxes of plasma fatty acids unfavorably promote ectopic lipid accu- mulation and lipotoxicity. Although a β3AR agonist, mirabegron, has been reported as a therapeutic target for lipotoxicity, previous clinical studies revealed low efficacy of mirabegron due to down- regulation of β3AR expression. In this study, we developed a phos- phodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, TMDU-3, as a cAMP inducer and examined its long-term effects on lipid quality.

**Materials and methods:**
PDE inhibitors increase intracellular cAMP concentration by preventing cAMP degradation. In silico screening for PDE inhibitors identified TMDU-3, which was a structural analogue of a PDE4 inhibitor, roflumilast. TMDU-3 or mirabegron was admin- istered to C57BL/6 mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks, and then their WAT was analyzed using proteomics and lipidomics.

**Results:**
Proteomic analysis of obese WAT revealed that catechola- mine resistance was caused by not only decreased cAMP production (low β3AR expression), but also increased cAMP degradation (high PDE4D expression), indicating that PDE4 inhibitors were reasonable therapeutic target for catecholamine resistance. PKA activity in obese WAT was fully recovered by oral administration of TMDU-3. In con- trast to mirabegron, TMDU-3 did not increase mRNA expression levels of beige adipocyte marker genes ( , , ).As a result of long-term activation of cAMP/PKA signaling, both TMDU-3 and mirabegron increased protein expression levels of thyroid hormone- inducible hepatic protein (THRSP) and thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST). THRSP is known to synthesize hexosylceramide (HexCer) from ceramide and increase oxygen consumption of WAT, whereas TST detoxifies ­H S and activates mitochondrial respiration and antioxidant system. Lipidomic analysis revealed that TMDU-3 restored impaired lipolytic activity and HexCer synthesis caused by obesity. Moreover, lipotoxic diseases, such as insulin resistance, MAFLD and albuminuria, were alleviated by TMDU-3. Long-term activation of cAMP/PKA sign- aling in WAT is a promising therapeutic strategy for lipotoxic diseases.

**Conclusion:**
Improvement of lipid quality by long-term cAMP/PKA signaling activation is an attractive therapeutic strategy for various metabolic diseases.

**Background and aims:**
Adipose tissue plays a central role in meta- bolic regulation, and its dysfunction contributes to insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the mechanisms underly- ing this relationship remain unclear. , a transmembrane glyco- protein involved in cancer and inflammation, has been implicated in adipose tissue function and insulin resistance through its interaction with the insulin receptor. In obesity, expression is elevated and associated with adipocyte dysfunction and extracellular matrix remodeling. This study aimed to investigate ’s role in human adipose tissue, examining its expression in obesity and T2D, its meta- bolic associations (including dexamethasone responsiveness), and its regulation after weight loss.

**Materials and methods:**
Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) samples were obtained via abdominal needle biopsies from individuals with and without T2D (20F/19M, age: 34-72 years, BMI: 22.4-39.9 kg/m²), as well from individuals with obesity and T2D who underwent bariatric surgery (3M/8F, age: 31-61 years, BMI: 31.1-40.1 kg/m²). SAT sam- ples were collected at baseline and 4, 24, and 104 weeks post-surgery. Part of the adipose tissue was treated with 300nM dexamethasone for 24 hours. RNA was isolated, and next-generation RNA sequencing was used for analysis of expression and other adipose tissue function genes. Basal and maximum lipolysis in isolated adipocytes were assessed after incubating with or without 0.5 μM Isoproterenol for 2 hours.

**Results:**
expression was 2-fold higher in obese vs. non-obese individuals (p<0.001). Among individuals with obesity, T2D dou- bled expression compared to those without T2D (p<0.001), whereas in individuals without obesity, did not differ by T2D status. In multivariate regression (model: HOMA-IR, sex and BMI), both sex (lower in males, std β =0.202, p<0.05) and HOMA-IR (std β = 0.494, p<0.001) were significant predictors of expression (p<0.001, adjusted ­R = 0.46). Following weight loss with bariatric surgery, expression decreased at four-weeks (p<0.05), return- ing to control levels by week 24. expression positively corre- lated with adipocyte isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis (p<0.01) and was higher in subjects with elevated FFA/glycerol AUC following an OGTT (p<0.001). It also correlated positively with genes involved in lipolysis ( , , , all p<0.01) and negatively with lipogenesis ( , , , all p<0.01) and glucocorticoid regulated genes ( , , and , p<0.01). treat- ment of adipose tissue with dexamethasone increased mRNA levels by ≅8-fold (p<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
expression in SAT is upregulated with obesity, especially in the presence of T2D, and is linked with adipocyte lipol- ytic response. Bariatric surgery-induced weight loss rapidly reverses this upregulation, suggesting a role in metabolic adaptation. Moreover, its upregulation by dexamethasone highlights a key hormonal regula- tory mechanism, making a potential target in obesity and T2D metabolic disorders.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus, and especially type-2, has recently been re-classified into five subtypes, each featuring distinct pathologies. Some of the described comorbidities are also observed in adipose tissue-related diseases, such as lipedema. Lipedema is charac- terized by bilaterally and disproportional accumulation of subcutane- ous adipose tissue (SAT) in the extremities, leading to pain, inflamma- tion, and mobility issues and predominantly affects women in all stages throughout life. The pathogenesis of lipedema remains poorly under- stood and a reliable diagnostic marker is currently missing. In a previ- ous study we showed that lipedema SAT is characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and stage dependent fibrosis, accompanied by an elevated proportion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. The identification of biomarkers may help to improve diagnosis of lipedema and to dis- tinguish the disease more reliably from diabetes-related comorbidities.

SAT biopsies of lipedema patients from stages I (n=7), II (n=11) and III (n=7) were analyzed by RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes in comparison to BMI- and age-matched controls (n=10). Additionally, molecular analy- ses were conducted to assess adipocyte functions and lipid metabolism in tissue and plasma samples. Statistical analyses were conducted using either unpaired two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test or unpaired Students’ t-test with Welch correction. A <0.05 was considered a statistically significantly difference.

**Results:**
Transcriptomic comparison revealed that 21 adipocyte spe- cific genes were upregulated stage-dependently in SAT of patients with lipedema compared to controls. Among the top candidate genes, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) was identified, which is involved in regulation of tissue remodeling and glucagon signaling. FAP is able to form heterodimers with it´s sequence homologue dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which was found to accumulate in the plasma of lipedema patients. Of note, plasma analyses showed that patients had elevated HDL-levels and reduced insulin levels compared to BMI-matched healthy individuals, which is altogether consistent with previous reports of lower diabetes incidences in patients with lipedema. Furthermore, the ω6/ω3 fatty acid ratio was increased stage-dependently in plasma of patients with lipedema, an effect that was mainly driven by a reduc- tion of the ω3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which affects glucose clearance and insulin signaling. Lastly, DPP4-levels correlated with elevated BMI in healthy individuals, while this correlation was absent in BMI matched patients, suggesting that altered DPP4-activity might be related to improved metabolic health.

**Conclusion:**
Lipedema is frequently misdiagnosed as obesity, although the molecular and metabolic phenotypes are distinct from those observed in obesity. The identification of specific disease mark- ers, representing such affected pathways, could improve diagnosis and treatment of lipedema and could help understand the molecular basis of improved metabolic health in patients despite the severe symptoms observed in the pathogenesis of lipedema.

**Progressive differences in adiposity and ectopic fat surrogates across four progressive glycaemia status groups reinforces weight/ ectopic fat reduction as the major target for prevention**

**Background and aims:**
There is growing evidence that obesity and ectopic liver fat are major modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, less is known about changes in weight and ectopic fat distribution as individuals progress from normoglycemia to prediabetes and eventually to T2D. Understanding these transitions could help bet- ter emphasize the role of obesity in the development and progression of prediabetes. This cross-sectional study examined differences in adipos- ity measures and commonly measured surrogate markers of ectopic fat across the glycaemia lifecourse.

**Materials and methods:**
UK Biobank white participants without baseline cardiovascular disease or known T2D (n = 287,987) were classified into four groups based on HbA1c: Normal (<42 mmol/mol), Prediabetes 1 (42-44.9 mmol/mol), Prediabetes 2 (45-47.9 mmol/mol), and Undiagnosed T2D (48-75 mmol/mol, without prior T2D diagnosis) We limited to upper end of the undiagnosed T2D group to 75mmol/mol limit unintentional weight loss. Ordered logistic regression and linear regression were used to test associations between HbA1c groups and differences in BMI, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), alanine aminotrans- ferase (ALT; a surrogate of liver fat), and triglycerides (circulating fat), after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation status, and statin use (as statins are known to influence HbA1c levels). The hypothesis was that a stepwise increase in these markers would occur with worsening gly- cemic status.

**Results:**
With increasing baseline HbA1c levels across the four groups, there was evidence of higher BMI, WHtR, ALT, and triglycerides. In particular, after adjustment, BMI exhibited a stepwise increase, with the prediabetes1, prediabetes2, and undiagnosed T2D groups having 2.73, 3.56, and 3.83 kg/m² higher BMI, respectively compared to the normal HbA1c group, with each step being significant (Table). Notably, such BMIs differences are broadly equivalent to average weight differ- entials of ~8 to 11kg in progressing from normoglycemia to prediabetes to T2D. WHtR followed a similar trend, rising by 0.044, 0.058, and 0.061 across the same groups. Notably, ALT and triglyceride levels also increased progressively. ALT was 3.81, 5.64, and 9.89 U/L higher, while triglycerides were 0.39, 0.46, and 0.63 mmol/L higher in the prediabetes1, prediabetes2, and undiagnosed T2D groups, respectively, compared to the normal group, again with each step being significantly different to preceding group (Table).

**Conclusion:**
A clear stepwise relationship emerged between worsening glycemic status and higher levels of adiposity and in circulating and hepatic ectopic fat markers. These findings reinforce weight interven- tion programs as a primary intervention target for preventing the pro- gression from normoglycemia to pre-diabetes to frank T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is associated with loss of skeletal muscle (SkM) mass and excess adiposity. SkM com- position, particularly myosteatosis, is associated with reduced exer- cise capacity. We aimed to determine if a change in SkM composi- tion following lifestyle intervention is independently associated with improved exercise capacity.

**Materials and methods:**
Post-hoc analysis of the DIASTOLIC trial. Adults living with obesity and T2D free of symptomatic car- diovascular disease were randomised (1:1:1) to receive either rou- tine care, thrice weekly exercise programme or a low-calorie meal replacement plan over 12 weeks. Participants undertook a symptom- limited incremental bicycle exercise test with expired gas analysis to quantify peak oxygen consumption ( ­VO ) at baseline and follow-up. MRI scanning acquired a 2-point Dixon sequence over five 5mm slices at the lumbar region. Participants across treatment arms were pooled for analysis. Images were analysed offline blinded to participant details by a single experienced observer using Java image manipulation (JIM) v 8.0 (Xinapse Systems) to quantify paravertebral muscle (PVM) volume and fat content. Multiple gen- eralised linear modelling was used to determine if the change in PMV and fat content were independently associated with change in ­VO (adjusted for baseline ­VO and clinical covariates).

**Results:**
Sixty-three of 89 participants completed the trial with com- plete VO2 and MRI images for analysis. Forty-three percent were women, and 38% were from a minority ethnic group. At baseline PVM volume was positively associated with ( =0.008, < 0.043) and PVM fat percentage was inversely associated with ­VO ( =- 1.13, <0.001) independent of age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI. At fol- low-up ­VO improved from 16.0 (13.3, 19.6) 17.5 (14, 20.3) ml/kg/min , =0.02 and paravertebral muscle volume decreased from 70.9±17.8 to 65.0± 6.6 ml, 0.001. PVM fat also reduced from 3.2% (1.4, 5.1) 2.2% (0.9, 3.9), <0.001. The change in PVM fat was not associated with the change in ­V0 on uni- variable (β = -0.09 (95% CI: 00.63-0.44) 0.728) or multivariable modelling ( 0.368). Similarly, changed PVM volume was not sig- nificantly associated with the change in ­V0 in the univariate ( 0.105) nor multivariable modelling ( 0.242). In the sub-group analysis of those in the MRP group who lost 14.0 ± 5.0kg in weight, there was a visible univariate association between change in PMV fat and change in ­VO (β = 0.61, (95% CI: -1.03-2.26) = 0.468), but this was not independently predictive of improved exer- cise capacity (β = 4.25, 95%, = 0.618).

**Conclusion:**
Across diastolic trial participants living with T2D and obesity there was an improvement in aerobic exercise capac- ity, reductions in skeletal myosteatosis and reduced PVM volume. However, the changes in PVM volume and composition were not associated with improved exercise capacity. Further work assess- ing whether changes in larger skeletal muscle groups associate with exercise capacity in T2D is required.

**Background and aims:**
This study aims to explore how the IGF2 signal affects testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells and to further investigate its mechanism in male hypogonadism and obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
A model of obese male mice was created by combining bilateral orchiectomy with a high-fat diet, and compared with sham surgery high-fat and normal chow groups for weight gain, serum hormone levels, and metabolic indicators.IGF2R expression in Leydig cells was detected. The distribution of cholesterol esters in Leydig cells was detected by confocal microscopy. ELISA was utilized to meas- ure testosterone levels. QPCR and Western Blot were used to analyze HSD17B3 and CYP7A1 levels. Finally, IGF2 supplementation therapy was employed.

**Results:**
Compared to sham surgery, orchiectomy-induced obese mice showed faster weight gain under high-fat diets, with reduced serum tes- tosterone, DHT, estradiol, and IGF2 levels. Igf2 was mainly expressed in Leydig cells, with Igf2r similarly expressed. IGF2 and IGF2R expression in Leydig cells correlated with key enzymes in testosterone synthesis. Cellular experiments confirmed that IGF2R knockout reduced testoster- one synthesis, while overexpression enhanced it. IGF2 supplementation activated AMPK, promoting lipophagy and increasing free cholesterol, which was converted to testosterone precursors. This improved testoster- one synthesis and mitigated obesity in orchiectomy-induced mice.

**Conclusion:**
The IGF2 signal has a positive regulatory effect on tes- tosterone synthesis in Leydig cells. IGF2 activates AMPK through the IGF2R signal, promotes lipophagy in Leydig cells, enhances cholesterol uptake and metabolism, and ultimately promotes testosterone synthe- sis. In the obese state, the weakening of the IGF2-IGF2R signal may lead to reduced testosterone synthesis, which may be associated with obesity-related hypogonadism. This finding provides a new perspective for understanding the regulatory mechanism of testosterone synthesis and may offer new therapeutic targets for the treatment of hypogonadism and obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Regenerating islet-derived (Reg) proteins were initially discovered in pancreas for their pro-proliferative effects on effects on endocrine beta cells and have since been linked to diverse pathological conditions, including diabetes. Nonetheless, Reg proteins are also found expressed in the intestinal epithelial layer. In a previ- ous clinical research trial, we discovered that administration of the commensal bacterium ( ) specifically and robustly upregulates Reg1B expression in the human duodenal mucosa, and this upregulation was associated with a favorable metabolic outcome, such as reduced glycemic variability. Till now, the role of the Reg1B protein and, specifically, the effects of its intestinal secretion in obesity and diabetes is unknown. Thus, in this study we investigated the effects of intestinal Reg1B using a murine model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) as well as in vitro assays.

**Materials and methods:**
, pancreatic β-cells were treated to varying concentrations of Reg1B to determine its effect on insulin secretion. For the DIO model, mice were fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity/insulin-resistance and subsequently administered daily 5μg human Reg1B via oral gavage for 6 weeks to evaluate Reg1B effects on diet-induced obesity. To determine the short-term effects of oral Reg1B on glucose metabolism, Reg1B was administered to obese diabetic one hour before performing the oral glucose-tolerance test.

**Results:**
Our findings indicate that Reg1B promotes pancreatic β-cells function . Furthermore, in the short-term study, oral supplementation of Reg1B to obese mice enhanced glucose clearance upon glucose challenge. Moreover, in the long-term DIO study, Reg1B administration improved insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatic triglyc- eride levels . Mechanistically, Reg1B was found to upregulate the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and fatty acid oxidation in liver. Additionally, within the inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT), Reg1B administration increases the expression of genes associated with mitochondrial metabolism and adipose tissue browning.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that Reg1B ameliorates insulin sensitivity, mitigates diet-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, and instigate a transcriptional reprogramming towards WAT-browning underscoring that, from the intestinal lumen, Reg1B exerts systemic metabolic benefits and is potentially as a novel thera- peutic for obesity.

**The impact of estrogen on crosstalk between perivascular adipose tissue and the vasculature**

A.C. Keller, M.M. ­Henckel, L.A. ­Knaub, G.J. ­Potter, M.D., ­Vazquez, J.E. ­Reusch

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes confers an elevated risk of cardio- vascular disease (CVD), characterized in part by vascular impair- ment. We and others have reported sex differences between vascular dysfunction in the context of CVD, but cellular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. We recently confirmed that perivascular adipose tis- sue (PVAT), a vasoregulatory adipose depot, can be remodeled by housing temperature, resulting in compromised vascular func- tion in females. We hypothesized that estrogen (E2) modulates this crosstalk.

**Materials and methods:**
Female 12-week-old Wistar rats were ovariectomized (OVX) or exposed to sham surgery and comprised three groups, n=8 in each: 1) OVX, 2) OVX with E2 addback (0.5 μM ad lib in water), and 3) sham. Rats were housed at either room temperature (RT=22°C) or their thermoneutrality (TN=29°C) for 14 weeks. At the end of the study, PVAT transplantation experiments, where PVAT was moved to alternate aorta, were conducted. Trans- plants included controls of PVAT + aorta for each group, OVX PVAT + OVX E2/sham aorta, and OVX E2 PVAT/sham + OVX aorta. Endpoints included vasodilation capacity, as a percentage of pre- constricted vessels, in response to acetylcholine (ACh). Plasma nitric oxide (NO) quantification, PVAT mitochondrial respiration, and flow cytometric characterization of macrophages were also conducted.

**Results:**
In aorta cleaned of PVAT, there were no differences in vaso- dilation between rats housed at RT or TN. In tissue from animals housed at RT, the OVX PVAT + OVX E2/sham aorta transplantation resulted in significantly greater aorta constriction as compared with control transplants at 50 μM ACh (51.01% ± 12.08% and 50.50% ± 5.32% versus 67.25% ± 23.14% and 71.38% ± 24.07%, respectively, p<0.05 dosage and transplantation interaction). Also in RT animals, the OVX E2 PVAT + OVX aorta transplant resulted in significantly greater aorta constriction versus control transplants at 50 μM ACh (48.65% ± 7.97% versus 93.84% ± 27.05%, p<0.05 dosage and trans- plantation interaction). There were no differences between transplants of animals housed at TN. Plasma NO concentrations in all groups housed at TN were lower than RT animals (p<05, temperature x E2 interaction). PVAT ATP-producing mitochondrial respiration rate in the sham TN group was elevated with lipid substrates compared with OVX E2 PVAT (1.44 ± 0.20 pmol/s*mg versus 0.84 ± 0.11 pmol/s*mg, p<0.05). Anti-inflammatory macrophages were elevated in OVX and sham animals housed at RT as compared with OVX E2 (37.13% ± 9.37% and 28.58% ± 9.12% versus 17.03% ± 5.92%), and dampened in these groups housed at TN (18.79% ± 1.90% and 15.26% ± 4.12% versus 27.33% ± 4.62%), approaching significance (p=0.07, E2 and temperature interaction).

**Conclusion:**
Our data strongly suggest that E2 modulates overall vas- cular tone, with strong impact on contractile function. Any protective or other E2 regulation of tone is lost with TN housing, indicating dam- aged receptor function or diminished downstream signaling, altered mitochondrial respiration, and a local climate of inflammation. Ongo- ing work focuses on altered PVAT lipid utilization, and secretome and vessel structural changes, as potential explanatory mechanisms.

**Circulating proteomics analysis reveals potential beneficial effects of HM17321 on muscle and bone**

H. Chon, S. Bae, I. Choi

**Background and aims:**
The weight reduction achieved through anti- obesity pharmacotherapy is not exclusively attributed to fat mass loss but is often accompanied by a reduction in fat-free mass, such as skel- etal muscle mass. A novel CRFR2 selective and biased urocortin-2 analog (UCN2), HM17321 (HM), has been developed and exhibited successful fat mass reduction with simultaneous increase in lean mass in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice, while semaglutide (sema) exhib- ited reduction of both fat and lean mass. In this study, we examined natural hormonal pathways possibly related with HM itself and muscle growth, as well as beneficial effects on muscle and bone with either HM or sema through blood proteomics from DIO mouse model.

**Materials and methods:**
Either vehicle, sema, or HM was treated on DIO mice with number of 4 subjects per each group. After 8 weeks of administration, blood was collected from left ventricle and SOMScan assay was employed to acquire proteomics data. More than 10,000 circulating proteins were profiled with semi-quantitative manner. Sub- sequent bioinformatic analysis was conducted using both single pro- tein abundancy comparison and pathway enrichment analysis. Relative abundancies of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and proopi- omelanocortin (POMC) were compared to analyze possible influence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and gonadotropin releas- ing hormone (GnRH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and lutein- izing hormone (LH) for intervention of male gonadotropin axis. Gene sets related to muscle differentiation, hypertrophy and bone formation and development were referred from MSigDB.

**Results:**
Influence of HPA axis by possible CRHR1 agonism is excluded with unaltered level of CRH and POMC in HM treated, while slight increase of POMC in sema treated may imply stress response due to sustained fasting. Contribution of male gonadotropin was denied in HM treated revealed by unaltered FSH and LH level with only 8 % decrease of GnRH denouncing possibility of testosterone related muscle growth. In pathway analysis, proteins involved in myogenesis, especially muscle cell differentiation, were upregulated in HM, sug- gesting active production of muscle fibers. Furthermore, the signaling pathway of muscle hypertrophy was upregulated in HM, whereas it was downregulated in sema, supporting previous in vivo results. In addition, HM showed increased expression of proteins related to bone development and bone growth, while V and Sema vice versa.

**Conclusion:**
HM has demonstrated superior weight loss quality by promoting fat reduction while increasing lean mass, particularly skel- etal muscle, in a DIO mouse model. The findings from serum prot- eomics have supported the beneficial effects on weight loss quality of HM while excluding possible side effects possibly related with HPA and gonadotropin axis. These results suggest that HM not only facili- tates effective obesity management but also preserves musculoskeletal health, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic strategy for improving body composition and metabolic outcomes.

**Low inflammatory phenotypes of monocyte-macrophage system in MODY2 compared to type 2 diabetes**

1. Department of Endocrinology, Peking Union Medical College Hos-
2. cal College, Beijing, China, Department of Medical Research Center,

**Background and aims:**
Trained immunity and myelopoiesis are key contributors to the progression of atherosclerosis. Hyperglycemia exac- erbates both processes, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in diabetic populations. Interestingly, patients with maturity- onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY2), caused by heterozygous glucokinase (GCK) gene mutation, exhibit lower cardiovascular com- plication risks compared to individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We postulate that MODY2 patients may exhibit weaker trained immunity and myelopoiesis phenotypes relative to T2D patients with similar glu- cose levels, potentially contributing to their reduced cardiovascular risk profile.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate the immune phenotypes of the monocyte-macrophage system, we generated a heterozygous GCK knockout C57BL/6J mouse model ­(GCK ) by CRISPR-Cas9 technol- ogy. We assigned a western diet (WD, 42% kcal from fat) and a normal diet (CD) to both ­GCK mice (KO) and wild-type mice (WT). Blood glucose and weight were monitored. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze myelopoiesis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with Pam3CSK4 and analyzed using proteomics and qRT-PCR to study trained immunity. Additionally, clinical data from MODY2 and age-sex-matched T2D patients were collected to charac- terize their blood cell indices.

**Results:**
KO-CD and WT-WD mice had comparable blood glucose lev- els, which were higher than in WT-CD mice and lower than in KO-WD mice. After 4 weeks of dietary intervention, blood monocyte proportion and inflammatory ­Ly6C monocyte proportion were markedly higher in WT-WD mice than in KO-CD mice (adj. <.01, n=10-12). Stimu- lated BMDMs from WT-WD mice exhibited notably higher increases in and mRNA levels compared to those from KO-CD mice (adj. <.05, n=6-11). KO-WD mice had a non-significant increase in monocyte proportion and a non-significant lower increase in mRNA relative to WT-WD mice. ReactomeGSA analysis of BMDM prot- eomics revealed that the significantly upregulated IL-1 signaling and NF-κB-related pathways (FDR <.01) showed lower average gene fold changes in stimulated BMDMs from ­GCK mice compared to WT mice under the same dietary intervention (n=3). qRT-PCR confirmed that and mRNA expression levels and fold changes were statistically increased in stimulated BMDMs from WT-WD mice, but not in KO-WD or KO-CD mice, compared to WT-CD (adj. <.05, n=5-6). In human studies, HbA1c-matched T2D patients without mac- rovascular diseases exhibited higher white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, platelet count, and cardio- vascular risk-related monocyte-to-HDL-C ratio than MODY2 patients ( <.05, n=23-29).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrate that ­GCK mice exhibit reduced myelopoiesis and macrophage trained immunity compared to T2D mice with similar blood glucose levels. Additionally, ­GCK mice fed a western diet display attenuated immune phenotypes despite hav- ing higher blood glucose levels. Clinical data further revealed lower inflammatory blood cell indices in MODY2 patients. These results sug- gest that the diminished myelopoiesis and trained immunity observed in MODY2 may contribute to their reduced cardiovascular risk profile.

**Acute cold exposure stimulates blood perfusion to perirenal adi- pose tissue**

S.E. Zaidi, Acosta, K.A. Virtanen, M. U-Din

**Background and aims:**
Perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT), a fat depot around the kidneys, exhibits brown fat-like characteristics in histologi- cal and transcriptomic analyses. However, its functional response to cold stimulation—known to activate several brown fat depots—remains unclear in adult humans. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute cold stress on blood perfusion in PRAT to determine whether it exhibits a functional response similar to supraclavicular brown fat. Additionally, we examined the influence of metabolic health, including adiposity and insulin resistance, on cold-stimulated PRAT metabolism.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied 40 adult volunteers (13M/27F) with normal weight or obesity. The normal weight group (Age: 34.2 ± 7.4 years, BMI: 23.5 ± 1.7 kg/m²) and the obesity group (Age: 36.0 ± 5.5 years, BMI: 34.4 ± 6.5 kg/m²) underwent two PET-CT scans with [¹ O] H O as radiotracer—one under acute cold stress and another at room temperature (RT). The cold exposure was applied for 2 hours before the scan and maintained during the scan using cooling blankets, with their temperature adjusted according to an individualized protocol to ensure consistent cold stress across all participants. Additionally, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was done to estimate insulin sensitivity and resistance using HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index.

**Results:**
Acute cold stress significantly increased PRAT blood per- fusion in all participants (RT: 10.30 ± 3.21 vs. Cold: 16.0 ± 9.36 ml/100g/min, p < 0.0001). The increase in PRAT blood perfusion in response to cold was more pronounced in adults with normal weight compared to those with obesity (80.98 % increase in adults with normal weight vs. 26.10% increase in adults with obesity, p = 0.01). At RT, PRAT blood perfusion showed a trend toward being lower in adults with obesity compared to those with normal (11.33 ± 3.58 vs. 9.16 ± 2.35 ml/100g/min, p = 0.0959), though the difference did not reach statistical significance. However, upon cold stress, the blood perfusion to PRAT was significantly different between adults with normal weight and adults with obesity (19.13 ± 9.94 vs. 12.32 ± 7.2 ml/100g/min, p = 0.0003). Cold-stimulated PRAT perfusion correlated directly with Matsuda index (rho = 0.460, p= 0.003), and inversely with HOMA- IR (rho = -0.501, p < 0.001). In contrast, PRAT perfusion at RT did not show significant relationships with Matsuda index or HOMA-IR.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that PRAT exhibits a functional response to acute cold stress, similar to the response observed in supraclavicular brown adipose tissue in healthy adults. Given that PRAT contains UCP1 in its mitochondria, this fat depot may func- tion as a thermogenic tissue during cold stress, potentially helping to preserve the functional integrity of the kidneys, which play a key role in regulating whole-body insulin sensitivity and resistance.

**Single nucleus RNA sequencing reveals the impact of LepR deficiency on the transcriptional and communicative profiles of hypothalamic**

S. Zhang

**Background and aims:**
The hypothalamus is a key metabolic center, and the leptin receptor (LepR) regulates energy balance. However, the effects of LepR deficiency on hypothalamic neurons are unclear.

**Materials and methods:**
Hypothalamic tissues from db/db and WT mice were analyzed using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA- seq), comparing gene expression across cell types.

**Results:**
We identified cell populations in the hypothalamus of db/ db and WT mice, and performed cell subpopulation identification in neurons. Furthermore, 19 neuronal subpopulations were identified. Differential expression analysis of cell populations revealed the high- est number of differentially expressed genes in GLUN (glutamater- gic neurons), GABAN (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons), OLI (oligodendrocytes), and AST (astrocytes) cells. Gene ontology (GO) pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that pathways related to cytoplasmic translation and ribo- somes were prominently enriched. Moreover, differential expression analysis of neuronal subpopulations revealed that LepR knockout mainly affects four neuronal subpopulations in the hypothalamus, including: Npy.Agrp.GABAN (Neuropeptide Y. Agouti-related protein. GABAN), Avp.Sim1.N (Arginine vasopressin. Sim1 tran- scription factor 1. Neurons), Esr1.Pomc.N (Estrogen receptor 1. Pro- opiomelanocortin. Neurons), and Tac1.Lmx1a.DAN (Tachykinin 1. Transcription factor Lmx1a. Dopaminergic Neurons). GO pathway enrichment analysis showed that LepR deficiency primarily affects synaptic transmission, protein translation, and oxidative phospho- rylation in these four types of neurons. hdWGCNA analysis revealed that co-expression modules associated with LepR deficiency were mainly enriched in pathways related to neuronal synaptic transmis- sion, synapse organization regulation, and signal transmission. Cell- Chat analysis showed that NRG signaling was significantly reduced in Npy.Agrp.GABAN. PCR, Western Blot, and immunofluorescence staining confirmed that the expression of Erbb4 was significantly downregulated in the hypothalamus of LepR-deficient mice.mecha- nisms associated with aging and metabolic diseases.

**Conclusion:**
This study reveals the effects of LepR deficiency on the transcriptional characteristics and cellular communication of hypothalamic neurons in db/db mice through single-nucleus RNA sequencing, hdWGCNA, and cell communication analysis. Overall, these findings provide valuable molecular biological insights into the role of LepR in hypothalamic metabolic regulation and offer new directions for future research.

**Obesity and schizophrenia: the road back to better physical health**

**Background and aims:**
Weight gain has come to define the life expe- rience of many people with schizophrenia and other severe enduring mental illnesses (SMI). Early weight gain predicts greater magnitude of longer-term weight gain, with the attendant long-term consequences including premature cardiovascular events and death. In this clinical intervention study, we aimed to determine whether weekly treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist is acceptable to individu- als in a psychiatric inpatient setting and will result in weight reduction.

**Materials and methods:**
15 people (11 men / 4 women) diagnosed schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg/m2 were commenced on semaglutide subcutaneously weekly with incremental dose increase, supported by the local weight management team. Body mass index (BMI), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and quality of life at baseline and follow-up were measured.

**Results:**
Mean age of the patients was 37 years: range (23-63). Time since diagnosis varied from 2 to 25 years. The duration of treatment with semaglutide ranged from 2- 6 months. Weight change varied from +1% to -12%, median 5%. The trend was for continued weight reduc- tion for 11/15 patients including 2 people who were discharged and no longer able to receive semaglutide 2 patients who elected to discontinue the treatment (Figure 1a). For all but one patient HbA1c fell. All those with a baseline HbA1c in the range 42-47mmol/mol (6.0-6.5%)(non- diabetic hyperglycaemia) saw reduction of HbA1c below 42mmol/mol 96%) at 3 months into the intervention (Figure 1a). Mean HbA1c fell from 41 (5.9% )(range 34-47) mmol/mol to 35.3 (5.4%) (31-45)mmol/ mol. EQ5D5L quality of life (QOL) visual analogue scale QOL-VAS showed mean improvement of 9.7 (range 0 to 30.1). Improvement in QOL was overall greater in people who stayed on semaglutide.

**Conclusion:**
In this feasibility study, at up to 6-month follow-up with semaglutide, we saw a reduction in BMI, reduction in HbA1c and improvement in self rated overall quality of life in 14/15 people with obesity and serious mental illness. Further evaluation, including health economic assessment may support incretins being offered with a view to improving health outcomes in people with SMI. We hope that our findings will support the use of incretins to help overweight people with severe enduring mental illness achieve a healthier cardiometa- bolic profile.

**Background and aims:**
Studies in children report a close associa- tion between obesity and cognitive deficits; structural and functional changes in the brain, including reduced thickness and hampered response of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the brain area responsible for executive functions. This study investigates the effects of an intensive 8-week lifestyle intervention (Mediterranean Diet and regular physical activity) on PFC activity in children with obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
The PFC activity was recorded in 10 children with overweight and obesity aged 7 to 11 years-old, using near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS, Artinis Brite 24) in resting-state condition, at fasting and following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; min 10 to 30), before (T0) and after 8-week lifestyle intervention (T1). Signals derived from 10 channels of each hemisphere were clustered into 4 dif- ferent areas: frontal pole (FP), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and frontotemporal cortex. After the pre-processing of raw signal, the oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and total- hemoglobin (HbT) values (respectively corresponding to cerebral blood flow and volume) of resting-state was compared between pre- and post- sessions using 1000 permutations t-test. The delta PFC activity (post minus pre) was compared between T0 and T1.

**Results:**
We found significant changes in PFC activity following OGTT after the 8-week intervention. Indeed, bilateral DLPFC and right FP activity were significantly greater at T1 than at T0 (T1 > T0, t = 3.68, p < 0.05 FDR uncorrected: ΔHbO-T0= -21.32 ­nmolcl vs. ΔHbO-T1 = 16.28 nmo∙l ) following the OGTT. The change at T1 in bilateral DLPFC was positively correlated with Matsuda Index (left HbO: r = 0.72, p = 0.17; right: r = 0.71, p = 0.21) and negatively with HOMA- IR (left: r = -0.78, p = 0.008; right HbT: r = - 0.94, p < 0.001). The change at T1 in left DLPFC was significantly correlated with sex (r = 0.66, p = 0.03), suggesting greater activity following OGTT in males. No association with circulating leptin levels was found.

**Conclusion:**
The present study demonstrates that lifestyle interven- tion, i.e. healthy diet and regular physical activity, can modify the PFC activity response following OGTT, particularly at the DLPFC, an area pivotal for regulating food-seeking behaviors, potentially enhancing inhibitory capacity and favoring weight loss. Sex-specific differences in PFC activity changes following lifestyle intervention need confirmation in a larger study population.

**Background and aims:**
Long-term body weight stability is difficult to achieve for many people, especially for women. The limbic sys- tem plays a crucial role in appetite regulation. Neurotransmission dis- turbances in the limbic system affect eating behavior and systemic metabolism regulation. Unstable body weight is connected with higher risk of cardiovascular, metabolic and psychological complications. Pre- vious studies in adults have focused mainly on association between weight loss and brain structures’ volumes. The study aimed to examine the association of the volumes of limbic system structures with body weight gain in women in the previous year.

**Materials and methods:**
The analysis included 504 women aged 20-70 years. Current use of antidepressive or/and antipsychotic medications, stroke, decompensated thyroid disease, and glucocorticosteroid use were the main exclusion criteria. Clinical examination and assessment of body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were per- formed. Women underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging scan- ning, and morphometric analysis of amygdala, nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus were conducted with Freesurfer program. Brain structure volumes were normalized to estimated intracranial volume. Based on information from medical history, we divided all participants into study group (with body weight gain in the previous year, n=212) and comparison group (without body weight gain in the previous year, n=292).

**Results:**
Study and comparison groups did not differ in age (45 vs. 45 years, p=0.857). Median reported percentage of body wight gain in the study group was 6.98%. Women with body weight gain in the previous year had higher body mass index - BMI (25.93 vs. 23.56kg/ m , p<0.001), higher severity of depressive symptoms in Beck scale (9 vs. 7 points, p=0.006) and lower normalized volume of left nucleus accumbens (0.00036 vs. 0.00037, p=0.014). Analysis of multivari- ate linear regression showed that volumes of left and right nucleus accumbens were associated with body weight gain in the previous year after adjustment for age, BMI, right-handedness and education years (β=-0.12, p=0.003, β=-0.09, p=0.027). Including severity of depres- sive symptoms, hours of sleep, alcohol intake, current smoking, lack of physical activity and the presence of diabetes to the models did not significantly affect the relationship between left nucleus accumbens volume and body weight gain. Analysis of body composition param- eters showed that right nucleus accumbens volume was associated with visceral fat mass and body weight gain in the previous year after adjust- ment for age, right-handedness, education years (β=-0.11, p=0.020, β=-0.08, p=0.041).

**Conclusion:**
Difficulties in maintaining stable body weight in women may result from disturbances in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway.

**Background and aims:**
Dietary weight loss intervention is an essential option for obesity treatment, but interindividual response variability hinder the success of dietary recommendations. Ketogenic diets (KD) are feasible option for weight loss with metabolic benefits as main- tenance of lean mass. Adipose tissue (AT), as target tissue of weight loss interventions, can play a relevant role in KD effects. microRNAs (miRNAs), transcriptional regulators secreted into the circulation, have been proposed as biomarkers of physiological processes and treatment response. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in circulating miRNAs in response to KD and adipocyte miRNA expression under ketonic bodies (KB) stimuli.

**Materials and methods:**
Plasma smallRNAseq analysis before and after 3 months of 4 dietary interventions for weight loss [Mediterra- nean Diet (control); 16h fasting and 8h feeding (16:8); normal protein and low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD); Alternate Day Fasting intervention (ADF)] was performed and results validated by real-time qPCR. Patients were classified according to their weight loss response in low-responder (LR) and high-responder (HR). miRNA and gene expression was analyzed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with the KB, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB).

**Results:**
All the interventions significantly decreased weight and body mass index (BMI). KD also led to a decrease in glycated hemoglobin, insulin and triglyceride levels (p<0.05). 21 circulat- ing miRNAs were significantly modulated by the different interven- tions. Among these, was exclusively increased after KD (p<0.05). Compared to LR group, HR group showed a higher increase after KD that was positively correlated with basal BMI, waist circumference and fat mass (p<0.05). This suggests an association between plasma levels after KD and base- line patient characteristics. BHB treatment increased expression and modulated lipolytic and glucose-related gene expression in adipocytes (p<0.05). target gene enrich- ment analysis showed a significant overrepresentation in biological processes related to catabolism, autophagy, muscle cell proliferation, hypoxia and nutrient and carbohydrate response.

**Conclusion:**
Circulating levels are related to KD response and patient baseline characteristics, which suggests a pos- sible role as biomarker of KD response. Effect of KD on weight loss might be mediated by its effects on expression in adipose tissue.

**Background and aims:**
Non-selective amylin analogs have shown clinical weight loss benefits, though clinical incidence of nausea and vomiting are high and may require prolonged dosing titrations. Moreo- ver, preclinical studies in rats suggest lean mass preservation versus GLP-1 receptor agonists. Herein, we evaluated weight loss efficacy, GI tolerability, and lean-mass preservation in rats administered eloralintide compared to the non-selective amylin analog, cagrilintide.

**Materials and methods:**
Peptides were made using automated peptide synthesizers and evaluated in amylin and calcitonin receptor functional and binding assays. PK and conditioned taste avoidance studies were performed using lean rats. Weight loss studies were carried out in lean and DIO rats using QNMR to determine body composition.

**Results:**
Eloralintide is an amylin peptide analog modified with a C20 fatty diacid moiety that binds to amylin receptors while retaining selectivity from calcitonin receptors. Eloralintide demonstrated pro- longed plasma half-life and reduced clearance compared to cagrilin- tide. In lean rats, eloralintide matched the food intake reductions of cagrilintide, resulting in a similar degree on body weight change, without the same degree of conditioned taste avoidance. In DIO rats, eloralintide lowered body weight primarily by loss of fat mass and with more potent effects for weight loss efficacy, food intake lowering, and fat mass reductions compared to cagrilintide, with head-to-head studies demonstrating reduced loss of lean mass in comparison to cagrilintide.

**Conclusion:**
Eloralintide demonstrated preclinical improvements in efficacy, GI tolerability, and quality of weight loss compared to the non-selective amylin analog cagrilintide. These findings support clini- cal investigation of eloralintide as a weight loss therapeutic.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a major public health concern worldwide. The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in sensing and controlling energy status. Thus, identifying factors affecting these functions will be relevant to control obesity. Environmental toxi- cants, including pesticides like Chlorpyrifos (CPF), have been linked to increased adiposity and metabolic dysfunction. However, the impact of CPF on hypothalamic regulation remains unclear. Here, we have investigated the effect of CPF in the regulation of the orexigenic neuropeptides, Npy and AgRP, both and .

**Materials and methods:**
CD-1 mice were exposed to CPF (10mg/ Kg/die) from conception to six months. In parallel, mHypoE-N46 hypothalamic cells were acutely (4h) and chronically (6 days) treated with CPF (1pM). Gene expression were assessed via qPCR, Npy and AgRP secretion were assessed by ELISA assays. Selective Estrogen Receptor (ER) antagonists (PHTPP for ERβ and MPP for ERα) were used to explore estrogen receptor involvement.

**Results:**
In the CD-1 mice, chronic exposure to CPF significantly increased and expression (respectively, by 1.7- and 2.2-fold, p<0.05) without affecting and levels. Also, a positive correlation was found between the and expres- sion levels (n=10; r=0.991; p<0.001). Similarly, mHypoE-N46 hypothalamic cells treated with CPF, both acutely and chronically, exhibited increased and expression (by 1.4- and 1.2- fold in acute treatment, p<0.01; by 1.4- and 1.3- fold in chronic treatment, p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively) along with enhanced neuropeptide secretion (by 1.8- and 2.0- fold in acute treatment, p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively; by 1.3- and 1.5- fold in chronic treatment, p<0.01). Moreover, CPF upregulated expression both (by 2.4-fold, p<0.05) and (by 1.4-fold in acute treatment, p<0.001; by 1.4-fold in chronic treatment, p<0.01), while levels remained unchanged. Notably, ERβ inhibition by 10μM PHTPP reversed CPF-induced effects, both acutely (with a 15.0% and 15.2% decrease in and expression, p<0.05 and p<0.001 respectively) and chronically (with a 61.5% and a 54.6% decrease in and expression, p<0.001). Remarkably, ERα inhibition by 10μM MPP further elevated and expres- sion (by 1.2- and 1.2- fold in acute treatment, p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively; by 1.2- and 1.6- fold in chronic treatment, p<0.05), confirming ERβ-mediated modulation.

**Conclusion:**
CPF disrupts hypothalamic orexigenic signaling by selec- tively modulating ERβ, which in turn amplifies orexigenic neuropeptide expression and secretion. These findings reveal a CPF potential role in metabolic dysregulation and underscore the need of further research on its impact on obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Neuropeptide Y (NPY), Dopamine and Mel- anocortin (MC) systems are implicated in the regulation of energy balance at the central level. These systems have been shown to exist in different peripheral tissues like the adipose tissue. Our study aims to disclose the peripheral interactions and the metabolic effects of such crosstalk in the adipose tissue.

**Materials and methods:**
3T3-L1 preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes, and ex vivo samples of rat adipose tissue were treated with dopamine, NPY3-36 or α-MSH and different antagonists for the dopamine receptors (DRs), to study the crosstalk and the metabolic outcomes of these interactions. High caloric diet (HCD)-fed Goto- Kakizaki (GK) rats were treated with bromocriptine, an agonist for Dopamine 2-like receptors. MC (MCRs) and NPY receptors (NPYRs) levels were measured in different peripheral tissues. Samples of vis- ceral adipose tissue (VAT) were collected from patients with obesity and gene expression of the systems machinery were accessed by qPCR. Spearman r test was used to calculate the correlations.

**Results:**
The gene expression of all the MCRs, as well as NPYR 2 and 4, is strongly correlated with DR 1 in patient samples (all the correla- tions have r>0.6 and p<0.001). Bromocriptine induced a complete remodeling of the MC and NPY systems in epididymal adipose tissue, with a significant increase in MCR 3 and 4, and NPYR 1 and 5, as well as in NPY and α-MSH peptide levels. The treatment of the undifferenti- ated and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells with dopamine and its antagonists showed that blocking D4R signaling results in a significant decrease of MCR 3 levels in adipocytes and NPYR 1 levels in preadipocytes. Regarding the metabolic outcomes, we observed a turn to catabolic activity with a significant increase in hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) activation, in ex vivo mesenteric AT, and in HSL and ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) activation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, when the samples were treated with both dopamine and α-MSH.

**Conclusion:**
These systems are correlated in human VAT and bro- mocriptine modulates both NPYergic and Melanocortinergic system in WAT. Moreover, D4R seems to be fundamental to NPY and MC receptors in preadipocytes and adipocytes, respectively, reinforcing the idea of a peripheral crosstalk between these systems. The interaction between these systems may be important to the modulation of adipose tissue catabolic activity.

**Background and aims:**
Active human brown adipose tissue (BAT) is linked to cardiometabolic health. BAT-resident progenitor cells (APCs) can differentiate into brown adipocytes (BAs), expanding the pool of catabolic adipocytes Understanding the molecular regulators determining APC fate is key to gain insights into adipocyte subtype formation and thermogenic differentiation. The TGFB pathway is a known inhibitor of adipogenesis. Secreted Follistatin-like 3 (FSTL3) negatively regulates TGFB signaling by antagonizing extracellular ligands and a nuclear FSTL3 isoform has been reported. We found increased FSTL3 expression in norepinephrine (NE)-activated human brown adipocytes. However, its role in thermogenic differentiation or BA function is yet unexplored.

**Materials and methods:**
FSTL3 knockdown (KD) was induced with siRNAs in primary human APCs from the supraclavicular BAT and differentiated . Effects of FSTL3 KD on thermogenic differen- tiation were examined with molecular assays including oxygen con- sumption measurements, RNA in suit hybridization and single nucleus RNA Sequencing (snSeq). Subcellular fractionation was performed on immortalized murine BAs to explore a potential nuclear FSTL3 function.

**Results:**
FSTL3 KD in APCs diminished NE-sensitivity in mature BAs evident in reduced respiratory capacity and decreased BA-specific marker expression, suggesting that FSTL3 is required to form func- tional BAs. To dissect the related molecular changes and to identify alternative cell fates, bulk RNA-Seq was performed 72 hours after KD induction. FSTL3 KD APCs exhibited altered morphology and were characterized by an unexpected immunomodulatory transcriptome with an increase in Interferon gamma signaling (INFy) related genes. This gene profile was maintained during differentiation and paralleled by elevated chemokine/cytokine release into the media. Moreover, cells evolving from FSTL3 KD APCs transcriptionally resemble to IFNy- stimulated control adipocytes. snRNA-Seq analysis at day 3 of dif- ferentiation corroborates the formation of adiponectin-positive adipo- cytes after FSTL3 KD, expressing markers indicative for antimicrobial defense and immunity. Lastly, subcelluar fractionation of murine BAs uncovered nuclear FSTL3 localization.

**Conclusion:**
FSTL3 KD promotes proinflammatory human adi- pocyte formation at the expense of thermogenic BAs. We propose FSTL3 as molecular switch, directing APCs fate to an adipogenic or immunomodulatory cell type depending on the microenvironment or inflammatory cues. Nuclear localized FSTL3 suggests an unexplored transcriptional regulatory role that may explain the profund impact of FSTL3 KD on the trajectory of brown adipogenesis. Increased levels of FSTL3 in adipose tissue of subjects with obesity hint to a potential compensatory effect of nuclear FSTL3 to counteract proinflammatory adipocytes and preserve functionally competent adipocytes.

**Background and aims:**
Fever is a physiological elevation of body temperature accompanied by increased production of inflammatory cytokines and adrenaline. Elevated body temperature is caused by shivering thermogenesis in skeletal muscle and non-shivering ther- mogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT), the latter being mediated by uncoupled oxidation of free fatty acid (FFA). Herein, we hypoth- esized that an acute temperature rise increases beta-adrenergic sign- aling-induced lipolysis in white adipocytes in a cytokine-independent manner, thereby providing FFA as energy substrate for non-shivering thermogenesis in BAT.

**Materials and methods:**
Primary murine and 3T3-L1 white adipo- cytes were incubated at 37°C or 40°C in the presence or absence of isoproterenol (1 μM) for 1 hour. Subsequently, FFA and glycerol con- centrations were measured in the supernatant. Moreover, molecular markers of lipolysis (hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), adipose tri- glyceride lipase (ATGL)) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were assessed using Western blotting and Seahorse analyser, respectively.

**Results:**
In both primary and 3T3-L1 white adipocytes, iso- proterenol-induced FFA release (% basal) was significantly increased at 40°C compared to 37°C (in 3T3-L1: 31.9±5.1 (37°C) 84.4±20.1 (40°C), p<0.05; in primary adipocytes: 89.6±22.6 (37°C) 150.6±37.4 (40°C), p<0.05)). In contrast, isoproterenol-induced glycerol release was not significantly differ- ent between 37°C and 40°C in both primary and 3T3-L1 adipo- cytes, suggesting that increased isoproterenol-induced FFA release at 40°C does not result from elevated lipolysis. In line, isoproterenol increased phosphorylation of HSL in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as expected, but the latter was not significantly affected by elevated temperature (1.0±0.2 (37°C, basal) 3.0±0.2 (37°C, isoproterenol) 1.4±0.3 (40°C, basal) 3.8±0.6 (40°C, isoproterenol); p<0.01 basal iso- proterenol for both temperatures, p=0.8 (basal 37°C basal 40°C) and p=0.5 (isoproterenol 37°C isoproterenol 40°C)). Similarly, ATGL protein levels were comparable between adipocytes incubated at 37°C and 40°C. In addition, preliminary Seahorse data indicated that OCR was not decreased at 40°C compared to 37°C, suggest- ing that reduced esterification rather than blunted FFA oxidation contributes to increased isoproterenol-induced FFA release under 40°C.

**Conclusion:**
An acute temperature rise in white adipocytes increases isoproterenol-induced FFA release without augmenting lipolysis and decreasing mitochondrial respiration. The increasingly released FFA at 40°C may serve as energy substrate for non-shivering thermogen- esis in BAT.

**High-fat/high-sugar diet leads to divergent effect on transcrip- tome and translatome across 5 mice metabolic tissues**

B. Toussaint, Froguel, A. Bonnefond

**Background and aims:**
The impact of a high-fat and high-sugar diet (HFHS) on mice metabolic tissue RNA (gene transcription) is well- documented, but its effect on the translatome (RNA to protein) is unknown. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) offers an innovative alter- native to mass spectrometry for assessing the proteome. Our study aims to demonstrate that the translatome provides a more complete perspective of the cellular response to metabolic disruptions.

**Materials and methods:**
Mice were fed either a standard diet (CD, n=5) or a high-fat/high-sugar diet (HFHS, n=5) for 8 weeks. We analyzed their transcriptome (RNA-seq) and translatome (Ribo-seq) in 5 tissues: brown adipose tissue (BAT), brain, heart, kidney, and liver. Analysis was focused on genes with transcription level (via RNA-seq) over 1 transcript per million (TPM). Differential analysis was performed using DESeq2, and pathway analysis was conducted using Metascape.

**Results:**
HFHS mice gained 25% more weight than CD mice. As expected, most genes (mean: 78%) were both actively transcribed (TPM>1) and translated (TPM>1) across the 5 tissues under both diets. In CD mice, 85% of transcriptionally/translationally uncoupled genes were translatome-specific in BAT, brain, heart or kidney tissue. In HFHS mice, this rose to 91%. Conversely, in the liver, 35% were translatome-specific in CD mice, decreasing to 22% in HFHS mice. Among the 2524 transcriptionally unregulated genes in response to HFHS across the 5 tissues, we compared translation-to-transcription TPM ratios. In the brain and liver, these ratios were significantly downregulated in response to HFHS (p < 0.0001), while in the heart, they were upregulated (p < 0.0001) [Fig.A]. Deeper analysis of tran- scriptionally unregulated genes in the liver revealed that 29 genes were significantly downregulated at translational level in response to HFHS. These genes were significantly enriched in pathways includ- ing “lipid biosynthetic process” and “steroid metabolic process”. Among those genes, encodes an enzyme involved in phos- phatidylcholine synthesis and lipid export. Pemt deficiency leads to hepatic steatosis and metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, is a GWAS susceptibility gene for human obesity. However, no correla- tion was found between liver mRNA levels and metabolic diseases in the literature. In our study, was not transcriptionally regulated in the liver in response to HFHS, however we showed that was significantly downregulated at translational level [Fig.B], potentially explaining its link to metabolic diseases, including fatty liver disease.

**Conclusion:**
As shown for , only analyzing the transcriptome can be misleading in pathophysiology. Considering all components of gene expression improves the understanding of functional effects in response to HFHS. The translatome analysis provides a better perspective of the cellular response to metabolic disruptions and their consequences in obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic disorders.

**Unravelling the links between obesity, chronic kidney disease and senescence**

**Background and aims:**
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious and increasing public health issue affecting more than 10% of the global population. CKD is characterised by a progressive and irreversible decline of kidney function, ultimately leading to end-stage renal dis- ease. Dialysis or transplantation are required in the terminal stages to supplement renal function. While high blood pressure and diabetes are the primary risk factors for developing CKD, obesity and aging are also significant concerns. Increasing evidence points out that cellular senescence is a crucial driver in the pathogenesis of CKD. Indeed, the accumulation of senescent cells leads to inflammation and fibrosis through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In recent years, senescence has been linked to CKD, obesity and aging. In the kidneys, senescence-associated (SA) alterations affect mostly proxi- mal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC). At the cellular level, senescence leads to metabolic disturbances and to alterations in lipid metabolism. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these disturbances in renal senescent cells. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a reliable and reproducible model of PTEC senes- cence to investigate the emerging roles of senescence in the kidney. Moreover, this model allows to examine the SA metabolic dysfunctions and the link between senescence and lipotoxicity in PTEC.

Here, we developed a senescence model in PTEC by exposing human kidney cells (HK-2) to 500 μM of hydrogen peroxide ­(H O ) for two hours. In parallel, lipotoxicity was induced in HK-2 cells by exposure to various concentrations of palmitate (PA) or BSA (vehicle) ranging from 50 to 500 μM for 24 hours.

**Results:**
Five days after exposure to ­H O , HK-2 cells displayed typical morphology of senescent cells, notably enlarged cell size (p=0.0065; n=4) and nuclear size (p=0.0347; n=3). They also exhibited well- known senescence features such as increased SA-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining (p<0.0001; n=5) and numerous γH2AX foci. Cell cycle arrest was highlighted through the upregulation of (p21) gene (p=0.0064; n=4) and the decrease of EdU incorporation (p<0.0001; n=6). Several SASP components were upregulated at the mRNA level such as (p<0.0001; n=4), (p=0.0046; n=4), (p=0.014; n=3) and (p=0.0056; n=3). Moreover, senescent cells displayed increased secreted levels of IL6 (p=0.0108; n=4) and IL8 (p=0.0009; n=6). Interestingly, distur- bances in lipid metabolism were also measured in senescent cells, as evidenced by a massive lipid droplet accumulation (p<0.0001; n=3) and an upregulation of the gene (p<0.0001; n=4). Here, cellular senescence induced lipotoxicity in PTEC, but little is known about the impact of lipotoxicity on senescence onset. Therefore, to determine whether there is a bidirectional link between senescence and lipotoxicity, HK-2 cells were exposed to PA. Prelimi- nary data indicate that HK-2 cells exposed to PA did not present any SA-morphological change or SA-β-gal staining.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, these results show that this robust ­H O -induced senescence model can be used to study tubular senes- cence and the underlying metabolic alterations.

**Background and aims:**
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that affects energy homeostasis by acting both in the brain and peripheral tissues, including adipose (AT). Dysregulated serotonin signaling is implicated in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Among its receptors, 5HTR1B shows therapeutic promise but mechanisms remain unclear. This study explored how energy excess or restriction in rats affects the abundance of serotonin and its receptor 5HTR1B in key brain regions relevant for reward processing and energy homeostasis. We also assessed 5HTR1B levels in rat inguinal (iWAT, subcutaneous depot) and epidydimal AT (eWAT, visceral depot) and human subcu- taneous (SAT) and visceral AT (omental, OAT).

**Materials and methods:**
Brains, iWAT and eWAT were collected from male Wistar rats given a calorie-restricted (CR), ad libitum chow (control, C), or cafeteria diet (diet-induced obesity, DIO) for 12 weeks (n=8-12/group). DIO rats had higher mean body weight (BW, 576 g) compared to C (493 g) and CR (424 g), and HOMA-IR (36.9, 25.7, 21.5, respectively). Serotonin was measured by mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) and 5HTR1B by immunofluorescence in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), caudate putamen (CPu) and hypothala- mus (Hth, n=3-6/group). 5HTR1B was also analyzed in rat iWAT and eWAT, and human SAT and OAT. Human AT were obtained by surgi- cal biopsy from individuals with or without obesity, no T2D (BMI 47.9 vs 22.4 kg/m , age 43 vs 50 y, respectively), matched for sex (8F/8M). Associations with metabolic phenotypes were evaluated.

**Results:**
Serotonin levels were lower in the Hth of DIO (33%) and CR rats (36%, both p<0.01 vs C), but were unchanged in the NAc and CPu. 5HTR1B levels in the Hth were similar between groups. Combining the C and DIO groups, Hth serotonin levels correlated negatively with BW, BW gain, HOMA-IR and leptin levels (all p<0.05). Multilinear regression (adjusted ­R =0.550) revealed BW gain (β=-0.725, p=0.016) as the strongest predictor of Hth sero- tonin levels. Combining the C with CR rats, Hth serotonin levels correlated positively with BW and leptin levels (p<0.05). In rats, 5HTR1B levels were higher in eWAT than iWAT in all groups (all p<0.001) and elevated in iWAT of DIO rats (p<0.05 vs C). In humans, 5HTR1B levels were similar between SAT and OAT and not changed by obesity. 5HTR1B levels in SAT correlated positively with HbA1c (p<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Both energy excess and restriction lowered Hth serotonin levels. The negative correlation between Hth serotonin and BW gain, when combining C and DIO rats, suggests that serotonin suppression as a response to BW gain may contribute to insulin resistance, but this does not seem to be mediated through alterations in 5HTR1B signal- ing. DIO rats displayed elevated 5HTR1B only in iWAT, highlighting a fat-depot-specific effect on this receptor. Functional consequences and translation of these findings to human obesity remain to be explored.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity and associated metabolic disorders are linked to adipocyte dysfunction with mitochondrial impairment. Current adipocyte research often employs hyperglycemic con- ditions modelling pathological environment rather than physiological with low glucose. We investigated the effects of different glucose con- centrations on human white adipocyte differentiation, bioenergetics, and metabolism.

**Materials and methods:**
We differentiated human primary preadi- pocytes from healthy volunteers without obesity using DMEM/F12- (F12, 17.6mM glucose), High Glucose- (HG, 25mM glucose), Low Glucose- (LG, 5.5mM glucose), and Galactose- (Gal, no glucose, 25mM galactose) -based media. We analyzed mitochondrial biogenesis, amount, morphology, mitochondrial respiration, glycolytic rate, redox parameters, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and transcriptomics profile. We performed ­C -labeled glucose fluxomix to study glucose metabolism under nutrient excess (F12) and physiological glucose (LG). Redox markers and gene expression in differentiated adipocytes were compared to white adipose tissue (WAT) samples from the same participants.

**Results:**
Nutrient excess induced a metabolic reprogramming of human adipocytes F12 and HG media promoted a glyco- lytic phenotype with increased glycolytic rate (F12 vs LG: 86.3 vs 54.7 nmol/min/10 cells), lactate production (F12 vs LG: 168 vs 86 nM/mg of protein), glucose flux into glycolysis pathway (F12 vs LG: 1.04 vs 4.3 Log2FC, all p < 0.05), decreased mito- chondrial biogenesis and respiration (F12 vs LG: 0.84 vs 1.42 units, basal OCR 394 vs 572 pmol/min/10 cells respectively, all p < 0.05), and elevated biosynthetic pathways intermediates based on fluxomics data. Moreover, F12 and HG induced redox stress by accumulation of NADH (F12 vs LG: 498 vs 292 pmol/ mg of protein, p<0.05), decrease of NAD+/NADH ratio (F12 vs LG: 6.6 vs 13-fold, p<0.05), and increase of mitochondrial reac- tive oxygen species production (F12 vs LG: ­2x10 vs 1.1x10 units, p<0.05). Finally, F12 led to decreased adipogenic differentia- tion efficiency (F12 vs LG: 26% vs 45%, p < 0.05), lipid accu- mulation (F12 vs LG: 2.4x10 vs 3.9x10 units, p < 0.05), and impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (ins vs baseline: F12: 3.1x10 units, ns, vs LG: 6.8x10 units, p < 0.05) LG adipocytes resembled the closest WAT phenotype based on NAD+/ NADH ratio, and expressions.

**Conclusion:**
Glucose excess altered human adipocyte metabolism and induced insulin resistance . These changes resemble met- abolic dysfunction observed in obesity, highlighting the importance of physiological glucose conditions in adipocyte research. Under- standing these adaptations may provide insights into obesity-related insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction.

**Metabolic changes drive differentiation of unilocular adipocytes in vitro**

C. Hagberg, borg, R. Nilsson

**Background and aims:**
Obesity and its comorbidities continue to rise worldwide, highlighting the need for an increased understanding of our principal lipid-storing organ, the white adipose tissue. While human white adipocytes contain a single central unilocular lipid droplet, most 2D and 3D culture models used for research lack this characteristic and feature only multilocular fat cells with many small lipid droplets in each cell. Importantly, the cellular programs controlling lipid droplet morphology among in vitro differentiated adipocytes have remained unknown. We therefore set out to identify these pathways to facilitate development of better mechanistic models.

**Materials and methods:**
We recently developed the Human Unilocu- lar Vascularized Adipocyte Spheroid (HUVAS) model, a scaffolded 3D culture model that enables the differentiation of human unilocular adipocytes and the study of their lipid droplet dynamics. To understand the drivers of unilocularity in vitro, we differentiated human subcutane- ous adipose tissue derived stromal vascular cells in parallel as either unilocular HUVAS cultures, multilocular scaffold-free 3D spheroids, or traditional multilocular 2D cultures, and subsequently performed bulk RNAseq, capillary western blot analyses, media metabolomics and functional assays.

**Results:**
The analyses showed that unilocular in vitro-differentiated white adipocytes are not defined by a significantly more pronounced expression of classical adipocyte markers such as PPARg or ATGL or by reduced fatty acid breakdown or fatty acid release. Rather, their lipid droplet size was correlated to metabolic genes and pathways, and functionally by a significantly higher capacity for taking up fatty acid tracers in comparison to the other cultures models. Pharmacological manipulation of adipocyte metabolism in HUVAS and 3D spheroids confirmed adipocyte metabolism to be causally linked to their lipid droplet morphology and to their fatty acid uptake capacity. Importantly, 2D cultures stood out by displaying high expression of pro-inflamma- tory and fibrotic genes, not present in any of the other culture models.

**Conclusion:**
We confirm HUVAS to be a human 3D adipose tissue model that recapitulates key features of the white adipocyte morphol- ogy and function, and by comparing different culture models using the same cells and media, we pinpoint metabolic changes to dictate adipocyte lipid droplet morphology in vitro. Our results are important as they may open up for further refinement of human mechanistical culture models and thereby enhance biological insights and increase translatability of obesity research.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are asso- ciated with an increased risk for severe clinical course of viral infec- tions, including COVID-19. Obesity is associated with adipose tissue infiltration with proinflammatory macrophages and development of chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance (IS) and T2D. Macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue may be stimulated by interferon gamma (IFNγ). IFNγ is involved in an early antiviral response and interacts with a specific receptor (IFNGR) on monocyte cell surface. Thus, IFNγ may be a factor linking obesity and T2D with an altered antiviral response. The aim of the present study was to ana- lyze IFNGR1 expression on monocytes and IFNγ-related gene expres- sion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in relation to obesity and glucose intolerance.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed two study groups. Study group 1 comprised 88 individuals, 18 with normal-weight and normal glucose tolerance, 29 with obesity and normal glucose tolerance (OB-NGT) and 41 with obesity and prediabetes or T2D (obesity - glucose intoler- ance, OB-GI). The analysis of monocyte subpopulation and cell surface IFNGR1 expression was performed with flow cytometry. PBMCs were also isolated. Study group 2 comprised 66 individuals, 8 normal-weight individuals undergoing abdominal surgery and 58 individuals with obe- sity undergoing bariatric surgery, 32 OB-NGT and 26 OB-GI. Gene expression was analyzed with qPCR in PBMCs in the study group 1 and in SAT in the study group 2.

**Results:**
In the study group 1, OB-NGT individuals and OB-GI indi- viduals had higher percentage of nonclassical monocytes and higher IFNGR1 expression on the cell surface of nonclassical monocytes com- pared to normal-weight individuals (all p < 0.001). IFNGR1 expression on nonclassical monocytes was related to BMI (r = 0.45, p < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (r = 0.26, p = 0.018), HOMA-IR (r = 0.37, p = 0.001) and HbA1c (r = 0.42, p < 0.001). In PBMCs, the expression of and IFNγ target genes, and was higher in OB-GI in comparison with normal-weight individuals (p = 0.008, p = 0.019, and p = 0.037, respectively). was associated with BMI (r = 0.21, p = 0.049), FPG (r = 0.32, p = 0.003) and HbA1c (r = 0.36, p = 0.001). was related to FPG (r = 0.26, p = 0.021), whereas was related to BMI (r = 0.25, p = 0.02) and FPG (r = 0.27, p = 0.015). In the study group 2, SAT and expres- sion was higher in the OB-NGT group and in the OB-GI group in com- parison with the normal-weight group ( , p = 0.37 and p = 0.02, respectively; , both p < 0.001). and were positively related to BMI (r = 0.25, p = 0.04 and r = 0.51, p < 0.001, respectively).

**Conclusion:**
Alterations in IFNγ-associated signaling molecules in SAT and PBMCs are already present in obesity and may be further aggravated with worsening glucose tolerance. It may be associated with altered antiviral response in obesity and T2D.

**Prevalence of obesity and metabolically-defined clinical obesity in a Chinese community-based population: an analysis based on novel diagnostic criteria**

Y.Y.F. Chen

**Background and aims:**
Current BMI-based measures of obesity inad- equately reflect body composition heterogeneity and fails to identify abdominal adiposity closely related to health status. The Lancet Dia- betes & Endocrinology Commission proposed novel diagnostic criteria for adiposity, introducing the concepts of clinical obesity and preclini- cal obesity. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of obesity and metabolically-defined clinical obesity, diagnosed using novel criteria, within a community-based Chinese population.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional analysis included 4,002 participants (aged 26-76 years, ≥5-year residency in Beijing Pinggu District) from the Pinggu Metabolic Disease Study (2013-2014). Obesity was defined using two approaches: 1.BMI combined with a single anthropometric indicator: BMI ≥28 kg/m² plus waist circumfer- ence (WC: male ≥90 cm, female ≥85 cm), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR: male>0.90, female>0.85), or waist-to-height ratio (WHtR >0.50); 2. Dual anthropometric indicators: Any two abnormal measures among WC, WHR, and WHtR. Metabolically-defined clinical obesity required obesity plus all these three metabolic abnormalities: Hyperglyce- mia: Fasting plasma glucose ≥6.1 mmol/L, 2h OGTT ≥7.8 mmol/L, or HbA1c ≥5.7%; Low HDL-C: Male <1.0 mmol/L, female <1.3 mmol/L; Hypertriglyceridemia: ≥1.7 mmol/L.

**Results:**
The prevalence of BMI-based measures of obesity was 28.7% (95% CI 27.3-30.1). When combining BMI with individual anthropo- metric measures, the prevalence of obesity was 27.3% (95% CI 25.9- 28.7) for BMI+WC, 24.3% (95% CI 23.0-25.6) for BMI+WHR, and 28.6% (95% CI 27.2-30.0) for BMI+WHtR. Using dual anthropometric criteria, the prevalence increased significantly: 40.9% (95% CI 39.4- 42.4) for WC+WHR, 47.8% (95% CI 46.3-49.3) for WC+WHtR, and 50.4% (95% CI 48.9-51.9) for WHR+WHtR. Notably, among these cases, 41.5% (95% CI 39.1-43.9), 42.8% (95% CI 40.6-45.0) and 51.8% (95% CI 49.6-54.0) were obese patients with BMI < 28, respectively. The overall obesity prevalence defined by the novel criteria reached 58.2% (95% CI 56.7-59.7), metabolically-defined clinical obesity was identified in 13.4% (95% CI 12.3-14.6) of the population, with 50.8% (95% CI 48.8-52.8) and 38.6% (95% CI 34.5-42.7) of these cases occur- ring in individuals with BMI <28 kg/m².

**Conclusion:**
Compared to current BMI-based measures of obesity, the novel criteria demonstrated superior sensitivity in identifying individuals with abdominal obesity and metabolically-defined clinical obesity, and doubled the detection rate of abdominal obesity, identi- fying nearly half of high-risk individuals misclassified by traditional BMI thresholds.

**Background and aims:**
The metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. MetS is composed of four major components: dysglycemia , hypertension, visceral adipos- ity and dyslipidemia. The gut microbiota (GM) plays a key role in metabolic diseases and acts as an endocrine organ regulating energy balance and immunity. To investigate how the GM affects host metabo- lism, metagenomics, metabolomics and clinical multi-omics integrative analysis have been used to: identify metabolome signatures specific to each MetS component, uncover a shared signature across all compo- nents, develop longitudinal predictive models for MetS complications, and investigate the causal role of GM metabolites in the development of these components.

**Materials and methods:**
247 obese subjects were divided according to the presence or absence of a clinical trait associated with the MetS. 16S metagenomic data were processed with QIIME2, taxonomically classi- fied using SILVA, and subjected to differential analysis with phyloseq and DESeq2. Alpha diversity metrics will be assessed with Vegan, and PICRUSt2 will be used to analyze the functional potential of ASVs shared among MetS components. Differentially abundant metabo- lites will be identified using a t-test and integrative analysis between metabolome and metagenome data will be performed using Spearman correlations. Support Vector Machines, LASSO and other machine learning algorithms will be used to build predictive models and identify key microbial-metabolic interactions associated with MetS.

**Results:**
Metagenomic comparative analysis revealed several metagen- omic features that are uniquely associated with single or multiple clini- cal components of MetS. Notably, an ASV belonging to the genus Bacteroides was found to be significantly associated with Diabetes, Hypertension, and Dyslipidemia. Numerous microbial genera belong- ing to the phylum Firmicutes, such as , , , and ; the phylum Bacteroidota, such as and ; as well as members of the phyla Proteobacteria and Desulfobacterota, including and , were found to be associated with at least two components of MetS. Preliminary results showed a shared metabolic signature between dys- glycemia and dyslipidemia. Integrative metagenomics-metabolomics analysis will be used to elucidate the associations between gut micro- biota imbalances and metabolic disturbances. Using machine learning, the identified microbial-metabolite signature will be used to develop prediction models for MetS.

**Conclusion:**
Comparative metagenomics revealed distinct and shared microbiome signatures for MetS components. Notably, one ASV belonging to the genus was significantly associated with all clinical traits of MetS, suggesting a role in disease onset. The identi- fication of a combined microbiota-metabolite signature, along with the implementation of predictive models, will provide novel mechanistic insights into how the GM contributes to the development and progres- sion of MetS.

**The cardiovascular risk depends on the definition of metabolically healthy obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis**

J.E. Nagy, Szentes, R. Hager, E. Sipter

**Background and aims:**
The mosaic of obesity and cardimetabolic comorbidities - especially in the case of the obesity phenotype called metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) - poses a clinical challenge in atherosclerosis screening. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a well- established tool for stratifying the risk of CVD. The current scientific literature shows conflicting data regarding CVD risk in MHO indi- viduals. Understanding the impact of less stringent metabolic health or obesity categorisation is crucial to asses metabolically healthy obes patient. Our research aimed to investigate the metabolic param- eters associated with elevated CAC. In different obesity phenotypes, according to various metabolic health (MH) definitions and obesity categories.

**Materials and methods:**
We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases for peer-reviewed articles published up to December 5, 2024, including cross-sectional and prospective studies that investi- gated whether MHO is associated with an increased risk of CAC. Stud- ies were grouped into different MH definitions and whether the study included overweight (OW) patients in the non-obese (NO) category. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. The risk of bias was assessed by the QUIPS tool.

**Results:**
The total of 13 studies were included in the systematic review, which comprised 8 studies with 27784 participants in the meta-analysis, in the fisrt set of studies, when the definition of meta- bolic health (MH) was less strict and allowed one metabolic issue, MHO individuals had significantly greater odds of developing CAC (OR 1.86 (95% CI:1.28-2.7)) compared to patients in MHNO cat- egory. When we looked at the effect based on strict metabolic char- acterisation (where metabolic health is defined as having no meta- bolic abnormalities) and strict obesity classification, strictly normal weight (NW) patients showed that MHO had significantly higher odds (OR 1.71(95%CI:1.01-2.88)) for coronary artery calcification (CAC) than MHNW. With the exact strict MH caracterisation but a less non-obese category (i.e., including overweight patinets as non- obese) the odds for CAC remained higher though not significantly (OR 1.51(95%CI:0.83-2.53)).

**Conclusion:**
These results indicate that how strictly we define obe- sity and metabolic health strongly influences the cardiovascular risk associated with obesity phenotypes. Our meta-analysis has further substantiated the hypothesis that similar to metabolic syndrome, obesity in isolation serves as a significant risk factor for the onset of CVD.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic flexibility - the ability to shift between carbohydrate and fat oxidation - helps maintain energy bal- ance. In severe obesity, this flexibility often declines, leading to higher respiratory quotient (RQ) and lower fat oxidation during fasting. Con- tinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may reveal how this inflexibility relates to altered glucose handling. We examined whether shifts in substrate oxidation correlate with CGM metrics during extended fast- ing in severe obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
This predefined subanalysis is part of an ongoing trial that characterizes metabolic phenotypes in severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m², no type 2 diabetes). Thirteen participants (mean age 46.15 ± 12.81 years, BMI 46.58 ± 7.16, 38.5% male) wore CGM devices while on a standardized diet for three days (Day 1-3). On Day 4, after overnight fasting, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and RQ (3×20 min) were measured using indirect calorimetry; body composition was measured via BodPod. Participants then continued water-only fasting until Day 5, when RMR and RQ were reassessed. CGM data covered a 27-hour fast (06:00 Day 1 to 09:00 Day 2). We calculated average glucose, area under the curve (AUC), and other glycemic variables, relating them to RQ.

**Results:**
Mean pre- and post-fasting RQ were 0.77 ± 0.07 and 0.74 ± 0.07, respectively. Glucose AUC was 148,832 ± 17,139 mg × min/dL. Post-fasting RQ positively correlated with glucose AUC (Figure 1) and other glycemic parameters (e.g., mean glucose, glucose variability). A larger drop in RQ from pre- to post-fasting showed a trend toward lower glucose AUC (r = 0.497, p = 0.08).

**Conclusion:**
A higher post-fasting RQ - and thus a smaller shift in substrate oxidation - may be linked to less favorable glycemic profiles in severe obesity. These results highlight the potential importance of metabolic flexibility in glycemic control during prolonged fasting and support the need for larger studies to validate these findings.

**Background and aims:**
Bariatric surgery enhances glucose metabolism, yet the detailed postprandial joint glucose and insu- lin responses, variability in individual outcomes and differences in surgical approaches remain poorly understood. To address this, we used hierarchical multi-output Gaussian process (HMOGP) regres- sion to reveal clinically relevant patterns between persons undergo- ing two types of bariatric surgery and between different metabolic conditions.

**Materials and methods:**
44 patients with obesity underwent either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (n=24) or One-Anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) (n=20) surgery. The patients were followed up at 6th and 12th months after the operation, during which they underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a mixed meal test (MMT). We modeled the individual postprandial glucose and insulin responses by HMOGP regression and estimated the average response curves from individual data. Additionally, metabolic status by weight, body com- position (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DEXA) and plasma lipids were determined.

**Results:**
A marked reduction in glycaemia, an earlier glucose peak and increase and sharpening in the postprandial glucose and insulin responses were evident in both metabolic tests post-operation. MMT resulted in higher postprandial glucose and insulin peaks compared with OGTT. Higher peak glucose in OGTT at 12 months (10.0 vs. 7.8 mmol/l, p<0.001) and in MMT (11.7 vs. 9.1 mmol/, p<0.001) and higher insulin responses in both tests (p<0.05) were observed after RYGB compared with OAGB. Time spent in hyperglycemia (TiH) was longer after RYGB vs. OAGB at 12th month, with 70 min vs. 47 min, p<0.05). Women and persons without T2DM had a healthier postpran- dial response with lower glucose and insulin peaks and less time spent in hyperglycemic range before and after surgery.

**Conclusion:**
Computational modelling with HMOGP regression offers a powerful tool to predict combined responses of patient cohorts to ingested glucose or a mixed meal, and help in assessing individual metabolic improvement after weight loss. Our findings suggest that RYGB and OAGB elicit distinct postprandial glucose-insulin dynam- ics, which may influence both surgical patient selection and post-bar- iatric outcomes. HMOGP modelling thus holds potential to advance personalized metabolic interventions and optimize treatment strategies in obesity care.

**Background and aims:**
Emerging evidence links pancreatic steatosis to insulin resistance, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer. While MRI/CT reliably quantifies pancreatic fat, their high-cost limits accessibility. Ultrasound offers affordability but lacks accuracy. This study aimed to develop a cost-effective predictive model for pancreatic steatosis using clinical and biochemical markers in high-risk populations.

**Materials and methods:**
We retrospectively analyzed 1,630 hospi- talized patients with diabetes (2019-2024), including 396 pancreatic steatosis cases (ultrasound-diagnosed, echogenicity > adjacent kid- ney). Twenty features (demographics, BMI categories, lipid profiles, liver/kidney function, glycemic markers) were selected. Missing data were imputed using label-specific means. Seven machine learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, etc.) and one deep learning (MLP) algorithm were trained (7:3 train-test split). Model performance was evaluated by accuracy, AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis, based on cooperative game theory, assigns each feature an importance value for a prediction, quantifying its contribution to the difference between the actual and average prediction. We used it to identify key predictors.

**Results:**
Logistic Regression outperformed other models with 74.6% accuracy, 0.762 AUC, 86.8% precision, 65.7% recall, and 0.748 F1-score. SHAP analysis revealed the top predictors: total cholesterol (negative correlation), sex, HDL-C, log HOMA-IR, TyG index, LDL-C, BMI category, HbA1c, and fasting glucose. Notably, total cholesterol inversely correlated with pancreatic steatosis risk (mechanism unclear).

**Conclusion:**
This logistic regression model offers a practical, non- invasive tool for predicting pancreatic steatosis in diabetic populations, leveraging routinely collected clinical data. The paradoxical role of total cholesterol warrants further investigation.

**Background and aims:**
Bariatric surgery is a well-established inter- vention for obesity and diabetes mellitus. However, evidence regarding its metabolic benefits in nondiabetic obese populations remains insuf- ficient. This study systematically compared postoperative metabolic outcomes between these groups using propensity score matching to assess the potential for expanding surgical indications.

**Materials and methods:**
A cohort of 177 obese patients, comprising 98 non-diabetic and 79 diabetic individuals who underwent bariatric surgery , were included in the study. Propensity score matching, utiliz- ing a 1:1 ratio with a caliper value of 0.1, was employed to balance baseline differences in age, sex, and BMI, resulting in 67 matched pairs. Repeated-measures analysis was conducted to evaluate weight loss (BMI and excess weight loss [EWL]), metabolic improvements, and comorbidity remission at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.

**Results:**
Following matching, baseline characteristics were comparable between groups (age: 32.3 vs. 33.8 years; BMI: 39.4 vs. 38.7 kg/m²; sex distribution: 29.9% vs. 32.8% male; all P > 0.05). At 12 months post-surgery, non-diabetic patients demonstrated significantly greater reductions in BMI (−12.88 ± 3.97 vs. −10.89 ± 3.53 kg/m², P = 0.011) and uric acid levels (−88.90 ± 77.24 vs. −57.89 ± 77.20 μmol/L, P = 0.050). Conversely, diabetic patients exhibited superior improvements in insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: −8.73 ± 8.05 vs. −4.73 ± 3.41, P = 0.002) and liver function (ALT: −72.04 ± 65.86 vs. −37.26 ± 35.77 U/L, P = 0.002; AST: −30.50 ± 35.23 vs. −17.49 ± 20.00 U/L, P = 0.029). However, there were no significant intergroup differences in weight loss efficacy (EWL: 90.7% vs. 82.1%; P > 0.05), improvements in lipid profiles (TG, TG/HDL ratio, LDL, TC, HDL), insulin, C-pep- tide, GGT levels, or remission rates of hypertension, hyperuricemia, or dyslipidemia (all P > 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
The metabolic advantages conferred by bariatric sur- gery are not contingent on the diabetic status of patients prior to the procedure. Notably, individuals without diabetes demonstrated more pronounced reductions in BMI and achieved superior control of uric acid levels, underscoring the extensive metabolic benefits of this inter- vention in nondiabetic cohorts.

**Background and aims:**
Biological differences between the sexes may influence the pathophysiology of some metabolic disorders, as well as the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs. GLP-1 agonist liraglutide is an antidiabetic and anti-obesity drug. Independent of its antidiabetic effects, it may have positive effects on some metabolic disorder associated with prediabetes, such as hepatic steatosis, insu- lin resistance, or renal dysfunction, although the exact mechanism is unknown. In addition, the beneficial effects of liraglutide may vary according to sex, including in women after the menopause. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of liraglutide administration in a prediabetic model without obesity and fasting hyperglycaemia on meta- bolic disorders associated with prediabetes and compared the treatment effect in relation to sex and reproductive status of females.

**Materials and methods:**
Seven-month-old male, female and ova- riectomized (OVX) female hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (HHTg) rats were used in this study. HHTg strain is a prediabetic model with insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, severe dyslipidaemia and ectopic lipid deposition. Liraglutide was administrated subcutane- ously (0.2 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks) and the markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity and inflammation were investigated.

**Results:**
HHTg males, females and OVX females had a significant reduction in body weight and visceral adiposity (p < 0.001) after lira- glutide treatment, even though the strain was not obese. Liraglutide administration significantly reduced serum triacylglyceride (TAG) levels (males: p < 0.05; females: p < 0.001; OVX females: p < 0.001) and NEFA levels (males: p < 0.05; females: p < 0.01; OVX females: p < 0.05). TAG accumulation in the liver was significantly reduced in females (p < 0.001) and in OVX females (p < 0.001), whereas no reduction was observed in males. Females of reproductive age showed significantly greater reduction in ectopic TAG deposition in myocar- dium (p < 0.05) and skeletal muscle (p < 0.01). Liraglutide also sig- nificantly decreased HOMA-IR in females (p < 0.01) and in OVX females (p < 0.001), while it did not change HOMA-IR in males. The most significant improvement in insulin sensitivity, in skeletal muscle and in visceral adipose tissue, after liraglutide treatment was observed in females of reproductive age. HHTg males and OVX females had higher leptin levels (males: p < 0.001; OVX females: p < 0.001) then females in reproductive age, however liraglutide significantly reduced serum leptin levels in each group (p < 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
The results suggest that sex and reproductive age may play a vital role in the efficacy of liraglutide on metabolic effects. In a prediabetic model, liraglutide treatment improved glucose tolerance and significantly reduced visceral adiposity and circulating lipids inde- pendent of sex and reproductive age. On the other hand, prediabetic females had a more pronounced reduction in ectopic lipid accumula- tion, greater improvement in insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism compared to prediabetic males and females with induced menopause. Ours findings suggest that the response to the liraglutide treatment may vary by sex and reproductive age, emphasize the need for an individual- ized approach in people with prediabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Ceramide, a sphingolipid, has a causal role in cardiometabolic disease. Ceramides containing saturated acyl tails of 16 and 18 carbons are considered particularly deleterious, due to frequent association with metabolic diseases and negative cardiovas- cular disease outcomes. Ceramide synthase (CerS), the enzyme which catalyses ceramide production, has six isoforms, each demonstrating specific fatty-acid substrate preference and tissue localisation. Selec- tive pharmacological inhibition of CerS isoforms which produce del- eterious ceramides, could potentially prevent cardiometabolic disease. Our study aimed to characterise the effects of ET2.39, a novel CerS inhibitor.

**Materials and methods:**
HEK293 cells were treated with ET2.39 and the effects on ceramide levels and cell viability were evaluated. Oral pharmacokinetics of ET2.39 was determined in mouse plasma via targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A 4 week high-fat diet (HFD) study was undertaken with male C57BL/6 mice provided Chow, HFD, or HFD + ET2.39 (~10 mg/kg/day) and physiological measurements (weight gain, fat and lean mass, glucose tolerance) taken throughout. Subcellular fractions were extracted from quadriceps muscle and liver using ultracentrifugation and an iodix- anol gradient. Enrichment was verified via western blotting of fraction markers. Lipids extracted from cells, whole tissue lysates and sub- cellular fractions, were analysed via a high throughput sphingolipid screening method utilising LC-MS methods capable of detecting 62 different sphingolipid species.

**Results:**
At 1uM ET2.39 significantly inhibited the production of C16:0 and C18:0 ceramides in HEK293 cells, without impacting on cell viability. In mice, oral delivery of 5 mg/kg ET2.39 resulted in a peak plasma concentration of 58 nM at 8 hours, with the half-life deter- mined to be 20 hrs. Dietary administration of ET2.39 prevented HFD- induced weight gain, but not glucose intolerance. ET2.39 also slowed the accretion of fat mass and resulted in significantly decreased mass of epididymal fat pads in mice. Subcellular fractions demonstrated unique sphingolipid composition. Overall sphingolipid content was greatest in the plasma membrane and nucleus. HFD significantly increased delete- rious ceramides across all cellular fractions. ET2.39 treatment signifi- cantly reduced C18 ceramides in quadriceps (50% lower), with similar trends shown in all cellular fractions. No major impact of ET2.39 on C16:0 ceramide levels was observed in tissues from mice.

**Conclusion:**
Different sphingolipid distributions exist across cellular fractions, and these can be altered by diet and pharmacological inhibi- tion. Our novel CerS inhibitor, ET2.39 demonstrates significant anti- obesogenic effects in mice fed a HFD, in conjunction with limiting the accumulation of deleterious C18:0 ceramides in key metabolic tissues.

**Metabolic profiles and peak expiratory flow: longitudinal associa- tion and risk prediction of severe airflow limitation**

S. Fu

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic abnormalities have been linked to impaired lung function, yet their long-term impact on peak expira- tory flow (PEF) and their role in predicting severe airflow limitation remain unclear. This study investigates the association between meta- bolic indicators and PEF, including longitudinal changes, and assesses whether these factors serve as independent predictors of severe airflow limitation.

**Materials and methods:**
Data were obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). In phase one, baseline data from 7,552 participants (2011-2012) were analyzed. Metabolic indicators were categorized into anthropometric (e.g., BP, pulse, sit- to-stand time, BMI, METS-IR, grip strength) and biochemical (e.g., fasting glucose, HbA1c, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C, CRP, uric acid) markers. PEF was the primary outcome. Cor- relation (linear/nonlinear) and multivariate regression analyses were conducted; stepwise regression identified optimal models. Severe airflow limitation was defined as PEF <80% of predicted. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors (AIC-based). In phase two, follow-up data from 11,120 participants (2015-2016) exam- ined temporal changes. Phase three assessed the longitudinal impact of metabolic changes (2011-2015) in 3,314 participants.

**Results:**
At baseline, grip strength and height showed a significant positive correlation with PEF, whereas age, HbA1c, and BMI were negatively associated. Biochemical markers such as creatinine and uric acid correlated positively with PEF (p<0.05). Multivariate regression identified weight, grip strength, BMI, age, HbA1c, cre- atinine, systolic pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C as significant predictors (p<0.05), with several factors reaching high statistical significance (p<0.001). Participants with severe airflow limitation had significantly higher age, systolic pressure, pulse pres- sure, and sit-to-stand time, but lower values in PEF, BMI, waist circumference, grip strength, cholesterol, creatinine, LDL-C, and triglycerides (p<0.05). Sit-to-stand time, waist circumference, and CRP were identified as independent risk factors (AUC = 0.72). The 2015-2016 follow-up data confirmed similar trends. Age showed a stronger correlation with PEF, while associations with BMI, grip strength, and HbA1c weakened. Participants with severe airflow limitation had higher diastolic pressure, HDL-C, CRP, but lower PEF, weight, waist circumference, grip strength, LDL-C, and tri- glycerides. Logistic regression identified prolonged sit-to-stand time, elevated triglycerides, and increased weight as risk factors, while higher pulse pressure and CRP were protective (AUC = 0.62). The third phase revealed that longitudinal changes in metabolic indicators from 2011-2015 showed weak correlations with PEF, with triglycer- ides, LDL-C, cholesterol, and HbA1c emerging as independent risk factors (AUC = 0.57).

**Conclusion:**
(1) In addition to age, height, weight, and grip strength, metabolic indicators such as HbA1c, creatinine, and uric acid are significantly associated with PEF. (2) Increased waist circumfer- ence, prolonged sit-to-stand time, and elevated CRP are independ- ent predictors of severe airflow limitation. (3) Longitudinal changes in metabolic markers have limited predictive value for PEF decline and severe airflow limitation.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic disorders are often associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, usually leading to increased apoptotic rates. Consequently, small DNA fragments, referred to as cell-free DNA (cfDNA), are released into the circulation, while retaining tissue-specific epigenetic signatures. This study aims to explore the application of cfDNA in diagnosing metabolic disorders, while examining its impact on adipocyte biology.

**Materials and methods:**
EDTA-blood samples from 204 patients in the Leipzig Obesity BioBank (LOBB) and 95 patients in the Obese Taste Buds (OTB) cohorts were used to extract and quantify cfDNA. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and omental visceral adipose tissue (OVAT) from a subcohort of LOBB patients, while capture enzymatic-methylation sequencing was performed on pooled LOBB cfDNA samples.

**Results:**
Blood cfDNA load positively correlated with body weight indicators, such as BMI (n = 298, ρ = 0.48, p.adj < 0.001), glucose homeostasis indices, such as HOMA-IR (n = 276, ρ = 0.37, p.adj < 0.001), and inflammation markers, such as IL-6 (n = 134, ρ = 0.51, p.adj < 0.001). In addition, macrophage count in OVAT showed a positive, although non-significant, correlation with blood cfDNA load (n = 35, ρ = 0.39, p.adj = 0.096). Interestingly, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified a proliferation-, differentiation- and apoptosis-related transcriptional gene cluster in OVAT associated with circulating cfDNA levels. Finally, tissue- specific methylation pattern deconvolution determined adipocytes as important contributors to blood cfDNA in patients with obesity, together with pancreas- and liver-derived cells.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings underscore the potential of cfDNA as diagnostic biomarker for metabolic disorders, and show how cfDNA can benefit investigations into epigenetic tissue-specific changes associated with obesity. Further investigations are currently ongo- ing to evaluate the effects of cfDNA release on adipocyte function, as well as to identify changes in cfDNA tissue-of-origin composition between patients with different stages of insulin sensitivity.

**Interleukin-17a concentration in patients with diabetes in long COVID, cardiorenal syndrome and obesity**

O. Kovzun, V. ­Pushkarev, L. ­Sokolova, A. ­Sokolova, N. ­Levchuk, M. ­Tronko

**Background and aims:**
Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is unique pro- inflammatory cytokine, which is intensively produced and modulated in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, also plays an important role in the functioning of the cardiovascular system. IL-17A is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complications associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and with inflammatory pro- cesses in obesity and diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied the level of interleukin-17A (IL- 17A) in the blood of 82 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) who had contracted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020-2021 years. Blood was obtained by standard venipuncture. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and samples were stored at -80 °C until use. IL- 17A was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Elabscience, USA).

**Results:**
We showed that the concentration of the cytokine was signifi- cantly higher in diabetic patients and in people who had COVID-19. A difference in cytokine levels in the blood of patients who had mild and severe forms of COVID-19 was noted, as well as a positive effect of vaccination. IL-17A concentration increased with diabetes duration of more than 15 years, with body mass index more than 30 kg/m and gly- cated hemoglobin (Hb1Ac) > 7.5%. COVID-19 additionally increased these indicators. There is a positive effect of metformin on IL-17A concentration in patients with diabetes and high interleukin response to COVID-19 in the absence of biguanide treatment. A positive effect of insulin and type 2 sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter inhibitors (iSGLT-2) was also noted. The amount of IL-17A increases in blood plasma with pathological changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria. The study of the concen- tration of IL-17A in blood plasma depending on the age of patients showed a tendency to decrease the amount of interleukin with age.

**Conclusion:**
A high level of IL-17A is observed in the blood plasma of patients with diabetes who had COVID-19 2-4 years ago, comparable to an acute disease. In the absence of treatment of patients with diabetes with glucose-lowering drugs in COVID-19, the level of IL-17A reaches high values. The study of the concentration of IL-17A in blood plasma depending on the age of patients showed a tendency to decrease the amount of interleukin in older age groups.

**Investigation on the current status of negative emotions in patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery and analysis of influ- encing factors**

J. Zhang

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (MBS) can provide long-term and sustained weight loss for patients. Obesity, MBS, and depressive mood are closely interrelated and influence each other. Early identification of depressive mood trajectories in obese patients and identifying mediating factors are crucial. This study aims to longitudinally investigate and summarize the trajectories of depres- sive mood changes in MBS patients during the perioperative period and after discharge, identify mediating factors, and provide a theoretical basis for the early detection, prevention, and individualized manage- ment of depressive mood in MBS patients.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included 200 obese patients who underwent MBS at the Department of Metabolic and Bariatric Sur- gery from October 2023 to October 2024. 184 patients were ultimately included. Baseline surveys and depression assessments (PHQ-9) were conducted. Quality of life (SF-36), anxiety (GAD-7), and metabolic equivalents (METs) were also assessed. Follow-ups were conducted at 1, 3, and 6 months post-surgery. A Gaussian mixture clustering model was applied to model the depressive mood trajectories of MBS patients. Mediation analysis was employed to explore the mediating factors between depressive mood improvement and weight loss outcomes.

**Results:**
With prolonged follow-up, liver and kidney function, blood lipids, blood glucose, and body composition indicators in MBS patients significantly decreased. Furthermore, as weight decreased, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores significantly declined, while SF-36 scores significantly increased. Based on PHQ-9 scores, patients were divided into depres- sive and non-depressive groups using a Gaussian mixture clustering model. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences between the two groups. Compared to the depressive group, the non-depressive group had lower GAD-7 scores and higher SF-36 scores, although there was no significant change in body mass index (BMI). Spearman correlation tests indicated that GAD-7, SF-36, medication adherence (MARS-12), physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physi- cal health (RP), and role limitations due to emotional problems (RE) were highly correlated with depressive mood. Subsequent principal component analysis (PCA) reduced these six indicators into five PCA variables, and multiple linear regression showed that these five PCA variables were linearly related to depressive mood. Mediation analysis revealed that METs had a mediating effect between depressive mood and BMI. Finally, the generalized additive model indicated a negative correlation between PHQ-9 and SF-36 (r = -0.3), while PHQ-9 showed a positive trend with BMI (r = 0.016).

**Conclusion:**
MBS can significantly reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms in obese patients while improving their quality of life. Depressive mood may indirectly affect weight changes by influencing daily physical activity.

**Endotrophin response following weight loss treatments in individu- als with and without metabolic dysfunction**

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a major global health issue, driv- ing metabolic dysfunction and increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, fibrosis and mortality. While various weight loss (WL) interventions exist, their impact on fibroblast activity and fibrosis-related biomarkers remains unclear. Elevated circulating level of endotrophin, released from type VI collagen during fibroblast activation, is associated with fibrosis, inflammation, diabetes and mortality. This study evaluates pharmacodynamic changes of endotrophin following three types of WL interventions in patient cohorts with metabolic dysfunction and obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
Endotrophin levels were measured with the PRO-C6 ELISA in serum of participants from three cohorts: Cohort 1: Very Low-Calorie Diet (VLCD) for 8-12 weeks in patients with Meta- bolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Disease (MASLD) and obesity (n=25). Cohort 2: Bariatric surgery (BS) in patients with obesity and MASLD, with 12-month follow-up (n=34). Cohort 3: Individuals with obesity but without diabetes (S-LITE study). After an 8-week low- calorie diet (LCD) induced weight loss, participants were randomized to placebo (n=40), exercise (n=40), Glucagon Like Peptide 1 (GLP- 1) receptor agonist (liraglutide) treatment (n=41), or liraglutide and exercise (n=45) for 1 year. PRO-C6 changes were analyzed in a linear mixed model adjusted for sex, age and smoking.

**Results:**
Cohort 1: Average reduction in BMI was 12% from baseline to 4-weeks post-VLCD (p < 0.0001), with no significant change in endo- trophin levels during the VLCD phase, or at 4-weeks or 9 months post- VLCD. Cohort 2: BS resulted in a 25% BMI reduction (p < 0.0001), with no significant change in endotrophin levels over the 12-months. Cohort 3: After the 8-week LCD, BMI decreased by 13% (p<0.001) and endotrophin levels decreased by 5% (p < 0.001). After the 1-year treatment period: The placebo-group regained 6.1kg and endotrophin increased by 7% (95% CI: 1.4% to 12.8%), (p = 0.014). The exercise- group maintained weight loss and endotrophin increased by 6% (95% CI: 0.00% to 11.6%), (p = 0.049). The liraglutide-group maintained weight loss and endotrophin remained stable, 1% (95% CI: -4.4 % to 6.3%), (p = 0.764). The liraglutide + exercise-group further lost 3.4 kg of weight whereas endotrophin slightly increased by 2% (95% CI: -3.3 % to 7.1%), (p =0.502).

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggests that endotrophin, quantified by PRO-C6, was unaffected by WL alone in MASLD, while a GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment (liraglutide) stabilized the reduction post- LCD in individuals with obesity without metabolic dysfunction, unlike exercise alone. This weight independent effect highlights the poten- tial role of a GLP-1 in fibroblast modulation and diabetes prevention. Further studies in cohorts treated with more efficacious weight loss therapies may further elucidate the pharmacodynamic changes of endo- trophin in relationship to weight loss.

**Background and aims:**
With the rising prevalence of childhood obe- sity, the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the pediatric population continues to grow. Studies in youth with T2D have evidenced a rapid decline in β-cell function in adolescent-onset T2D, compared with a slower decline in adult-onset disease. However, while the evolution of the disease is more aggressive when its onset is early in life, the recovery or temporary remission upon treatment is more prevalent at early ages. Gliflozins (SGLT2 inhibitors) are therapeutics prescribed to adults with T2D; apart from their anti-hyperglycaemic benefit, they are simultaneously capable of producing pleiotropic effects, including a positive impact on insulin production and β-cell mass, but the mecha- nisms underlying this effect are not yet fully understood. Therefore, we aimed to assess the potential of canagliflozin (cana) in preventing/ reversing β-cell identity loss and regenerating the islets in a pediatric model of severe T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
TallyHO (TH) male mice, a polygenic model of T2D, develop an early-onset diabetes (TH-D), characterized by a rapid decline in β-cell function and mass and severe hyperglyce- mia. Mice were randomized to receive a standard chow or [chow + cana (100 ppm)] diet for 10 weeks. We have previously shown that this regimen efficiently induced moderate glucosuria and elevated urine output in TH-D mice. At the end of the study, mice were euthanized and tissues were collected for biochemical assays and immunohisto- chemistry. We evaluated the pancreatic islet phenotype, β-cell mass, and identity markers.

**Results:**
In a fasting/refeeding experiment, cana reduced the fasting and post-feeding BG levels of TH-D mice by ~50% and, respectively, 37.5%. C-peptide levels, insulin content, and HOMA-B index (but not HOMA-IR and plasma glucagon levels) were significantly higher in TH-D/Cana vs. TH-D/chow mice, suggesting improved β-cell func- tion. Cana restored islet area in severely diabetic mice and it was highly effective in reducing alpha-cell hyperplasia in diabetic mice while increasing the β-cell content of islets, with significantly reduced apoptosis. We found many small clusters (max. 5 Ins+ cells) in the TH-D/Cana pancreata compared to the TH-D/chow tissues (~24.5% vs. 8.9%; P<0.05), which depicts a possible β-cell neogenesis under cana treatment. Super-resolution microscopy images of the pancreas sections documented that TH-D/Cana β-cells had smaller cytoplasmic insulin granules compared to those of TH-D diabetic cells (P<0.0001). When analyzed for β-cell identity markers, cana reduced the number of abnormal Gcg+Pdx1+ cells/islet and restored the expression of Pdx1, Nkx6.1, Glut2, and Pc1/3 in Ins+ cells. Finally, in many TH-D/Cana islets, the mobilization of epithelial cells near the ductal lumen that adopted an Ngn3+ endocrine identity was reduced compared to TH-D/ chow islets.

**Conclusion:**
Cana treatment prevented β-cell dedifferentiation by sta- bilizing its identity and enabled the regeneration of damaged islets in the early onset of severe β-cell deficiency. These beneficial effects are possibly due to the activation of endogenous mechanisms that fine-tune the homeostatic renewal of pancreatic endocrine cells.

**Background and aims:**
The latest peptide-based advancements within the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic pharmacological space consist of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor dual-agonists, and GLP-1/ GIP/Glucagon (Gcg) receptor triple agonists. GLP-1/GIP dual-ago- nists have outperformed GLP-1R mono-agonists on food intake sup- pression and glucoregulatory effects, while the hybridized inclusion of Gcg increases energy expenditure and markedly amplifies body weight-lowering capacity. However, questions remain as to which biological intact systems are required for the additional enhancement in body weight-lowering efficacy by the GLP-1/GIP/Gcg triagonist.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate the biological mediators of increased energy expenditure in response to GLP-1/GIP/Gcg triag- onism, we assessed key metabolic parameters across several relevant knockout (KO) mouse models in the context of diet-induced obesity (DIO). These models include hepatic GcgR KO, hepatic FGF21 KO, adiponectin KO, germline UCP1 KO, adult-onset UCP1 KO, brown adipose tissue-specific GcgR KO, and a novel, first-in-class GLP-1R/ GIPR/GcgR triple knockout (3KO) line.

**Results:**
We first demonstrate the novel GLP-1R/GIPR/GcgR 3KO mouse to be protected from DIO relative to WT controls, as evi- denced by reduced body weight (WT: 50 g; 3KO: 38 g; n = 8-9; p = 0.005) and improved glucose tolerance (WT AUC: 100%; 3KO AUC: 37%; n = 8-9; p < 0.0001). We then confirm triagonist-induced effects on food intake, body weight, energy expenditure, and res- piratory exchange ratio (RER) are completely abolished in high- fat diet-fed 3KO mice, supporting specificity of triagonist target- ing. In hepatic GcgR KO mice, body weight-lowering efficacy of the triagonist is significantly attenuated by 43% compared to WT controls (n = 8; p = 0.003), despite a similar suppression of food intake. Furthermore, hepatic deletion of the glucagon-responsive hormone FGF21 reduces triagonist-induced body weight loss by 48% relative to WT controls (n = 8; p = 0.01). However, KO of the FGF21-responsive hormone adiponectin does not confer differences in triagonist-induced body weight loss, suggesting involvement of alternative mechanisms downstream of hepatic GcgR-FGF21 signal- ing. Global UCP1 KO mice, whether at room temperature or ther- moneutrality, show no difference in triagonist-induced weight loss versus wild-type controls. Similarly, adult-onset UCP1 KO mice, used to avoid compensatory thermogenic adaptations, respond com- parably. Lastly, triagonist GcgR agonism in brown adipose tissue is expendable as demonstrated by unchanged triagonist efficacy in brown fat-specific GcgR KO mice.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, using various DIO mouse KO models, our results support the liver-specific GcgR-FGF21 signaling axis to facilitate GLP-1/GIP/Gcg-mediated increases in energy expenditure independent of brown adipose tissue thermogenic capacity.

**Mechanistic insights into the potent anti-obesity effects of HM15275, a novel long-acting GLP-1/GIP/glucagon triple agonist**

Y. Kim, Lee, I. Choi

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is increasingly recognized as a global health crisis due to its association with various metabolic diseases, emphasizing the urgent need for effective treatment. To address this, HM15275, a long-acting GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonist, was devel- oped and has demonstrated significant body weight loss (BWL) and improved glycemic control in preclinical studies. This study aimed to further evaluate the anti-obesity effects of HM15275 in compari- son with other incretin drugs and to explore its mechanisms of action (MoA) in mouse models of obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
The effects of HM15275 on BWL and body composition were evaluated in DIO mice, including a switching study from Semaglutide (SEMA) or tirzepatide(TZP) to HM15275. GLP-1R KO mice were utilized for target engagement study. To understand the underlying mechanism for its potent BWL, pair-fed and energy expenditure studies were conducted, followed by histologic analysis in mesenteric white adipose tissue (mWAT). SEMA, TZP, and/or in- house synthesized retatrutide (RETA) served as comparative controls.

**Results:**
In DIO mice, a 3-week treatment with HM15275 resulted in greater BWL (-39.9% vs. baseline) compared to SEMA (-14.9%) and TZP (-25.3%). Importantly, despite a greater reduction in fat mass, HM15275 led to less lean mass loss than TZP, suggesting improved weight loss quality. Potent BWL effect of HM15275 was further dem- onstrated when switching from SEMA or TZP. Notably, in GLP-1R KO mice, HM15275 still induced significantly greater BWL (-24.5% vs. baseline) than SEMA (+3.6%) and TZP (-4.2%) along with an improved ipGTT profile, suggesting that HM15275 elicits optimized GIP and glucagon receptor engagement for both BWL and favorable glycemic control. Pair-fed and energy expenditure studies revealed that, in addition to food intake regulation, enhanced energy expenditure con- tributed to potent BWL by HM15275. Consistently, the expression of PGC-1α and UCP-1 in mWAT was significantly increased by HM15275 treatment compared to vehicle or TZP. Furthermore, a 6-week treat- ment with HM15275 resulted in significantly greater BWL and fat mass loss compared to RETA with no difference in lean mass, highlighting its improved weight loss potency and quality.

**Conclusion:**
In DIO mice, HM15275 demonstrated BWL primarily driven by fat mass reduction, with greater effects than other incretin drugs. In addition, comprehensive MoA studies elucidated the under- lying mechanism for its potent BWL. These findings highlight the potential of HM15275 to enable both quantitatively and qualitatively improved obesity management. The clinical translation of these results will be further explored in planned phase 2 studies.

**An unimolecular GLP-1R/GIPR/Pan-PPAR quintuple agonist eliminates obesity and insulin resistance in mice**

D. Liskiewicz, A. ­Novikoff, A. ­Khalil, J. ­Campbell, A., Cebrian ­Serrano, J. ­Douros, C. ­Kusminski, J. ­Wean, P. ­Scherer, R. ­Seeley, R. ­DiMarchi, M.H. Tschöp, N. ­Krahmer, P. ­Knerr, T.D. Müller

**Background and aims:**
Drugs to improve obesity-linked metabolic dysfunction are on the rise, with unimolecular GLP-1R:GIPR co-ago- nism emerging as the most effective approach for managing obesity and type 2 diabetes. To further enhance the metabolic benefits of GLP- 1R:GIPR co-agonism, we report the design and preclinical evaluation of a novel unimolecular quintuple agonist. This innovative therapeutic combines the body weight-lowering and blood glucose-reducing effects of GLP-1R:GIPR co-agonism with the insulin-sensitizing properties of a panPPAR agonist. The targeted delivery of the panPPAR agonist is restricted to cells expressing receptors for either GIP or GLP-1, ensur- ing precise action.

**Materials and methods:**
BRET assays in transfected HEK293 cells, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets, and c-FOS activation in selected brain areas were used to assess the sign- aling properties of the new compound. To demonstrate its therapeu- tic efficacy and provide mechanistic insights into its mode of action, genetic (db/db) and diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse models, as well as models with incretin receptor deletion or adipocyte-specific GIPR overexpression, were employed alongside untargeted proteomics.

**Results:**
GLP-1:GIP:PanPPAR agonist is indistinguishable from GLP- 1:GIP backbone in GIPR and GLP-1R signaling, and stimulation of insulin secretion in isolated mouse pancreatic islets and cFOS activa- tion in arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract. In vivo, GLP-1:GIP:PanPPAR quintuple agonist exhibits superior efficacy compared to GLP-1:GIP or semaglutide in reducing body weight, decreasing food intake, and improving hyper- glycemia in obese and insulin-resistant mice. These enhanced effects stem from the synergistic actions of incretin and PPAR pathways in the brain and adipose tissue. Furthermore, its effects are amplified in DIO mice with adipose-specific overexpression of GIPR and are absent in double-incretin receptor knockout mice.

**Conclusion:**
Notably, the GLP-1:GIP:PanPPAR agonist is significantly more effective than either GLP-1:GIP or panPPAR agonist alone, or when administered as a loose combination, in reducing body weight and enhancing energy metabolism and glucose control. Building on these findings, this novel quintuple polyagonist holds unprecedented therapeutic value to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes.

1. Physiogenex, Escalquens, France, Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle,

**Background and aims:**
Retatrutide is a novel triple agonist of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucagon receptors that demonstrated significant body weight loss and liver fat reduction in patients with obesity. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of retatrutide in the AMLN-diet induced obese MASH mouse model, a preclinical model routinely used for preclinical drug development.

**Materials and methods:**
C57BL/6JRj mice were fed the AMLN-diet for 35 weeks to induce obesity and MASH, before a 5-week treat- ment with vehicle or retatrutide 15nmol/kg s.c. Q3D. A group of age-matched/control chow fed mice was included as negative control. Body weight, food/water intake, whole body composition and energy expenditure were monitored during the treatment period, then blood and liver were collected for biochemistry and histology analysis after 5 weeks of treatment.

**Results:**
As expected, 5-week treatment with retatrutide strongly reduced body weight by 31% (p<0.0001 vs. vehicle) with significant reduction in fat and lean mass. The weight loss was also associated with a strong inhibition of food and water intake during the first days of treatment and a significantly greater energy expenditure at the end of the treatment period. Compared with vehicle, retatrutide significantly reduced fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin, leading to a 69% lower HOMA-IR index of insulin resistance (p<0.0001 vs. vehicle). Retatrutide did not alter plasma transaminases levels and fasting plasma triglycerides, but reduced total cholesterol levels (-37%, p<0.01). Com- pared with vehicle, retatrutide markedly decreased liver mass (-44%, p<0.0001) and strongly reduced hepatic fatty acids, triglycerides and total cholesterol content (-66%, -75% and 45%, all p<0.001). Although the 5-week treatment period did not reduce hepatic inflammation and portal fibrosis, histology analysis also showed a 2-fold lower steatosis score with retatrutide (p<0.0001 vs. vehicle).

**Conclusion:**
In the AMLN-diet induced obese MASH mouse model, a 5-week treatment with retatrutide demonstrates multiple metabolic benefits and a strong reduction in liver steatosis. This preclinical data set will help to further assess the efficacy of novel therapies targeting obesity and MASH versus retatrutide as reference.

**Therapeutic NuSH cocktails: co-administration of an ultra-long acting PYY analogue engineered for tolerability and an ultra- long acting GLP-1 analogue induces significant weight loss in DIO mice**

C. Hinds, Hansford, R. Gil, J. Minnion, M. Serrano-Wu, W. Adams

**Background and aims:**
We hypothesise that combinations of nutri- ent-stimulated hormones (NuSH) may enhance weight loss efficacy and improve tolerability as they more closely mimic the state of post- prandial satiety. We designed an ultra-long acting peptide YY (PYY) analogue, M-1793, for miscible combination with an ultra-long act- ing glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Here, we describe preclinical proof of concept of their efficacy.

**Materials and methods:**
We assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK) of M-1793 after single administration in minipigs and dogs and body weight loss after repeat administration to diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated intracellu- lar cAMP accumulation was measured in CHO-K1 cells expressing human Y1R and Y2R. The effects of M-1793 on DIO mice were evaluated alone and in combination with MET-097, a potent ultra- long acting GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) currently in clinical development.

**Results:**
M-1793 is a potent and selective agonist of Y2R with activ- ity comparable to human ­PYY ­(EC values of 2.4 and 2.2 nM, respectively) but inactive at Y1R. When administered daily to DIO mice, M-1793 causes dose-dependent reduction in food intake and body weight (>10% in 7 days from 2.25 nmol/kg; see Figure 1A). When combined with the GLP-1RA MET-097, 0.75 nmol/kg M-1793 plus 1 nmol/kg MET-097 achieved a more than additive and statis- tically greater body weight loss (20.3%) in 6 days than 1 nmol/kg MET-097 alone (10.6%) (p<0.0001; see Figure 1B). M-1793 has a favourable PK profile, including a long half-life (174 h) in minipigs and a prolonged ­T , consistent with MET-097. The PK profile of M-1793 was also characterised in dogs and correlated with emesis. Specifically, M-1793 delivered subcutaneously ­(C = 94 ng/mL; ­T = 36 h) completely avoided emesis (0 emesis episodes) com- pared with equivalent doses (10 μg/kg) of a short-acting ­(T <1 h) PYY analogue, which caused 7 emesis episodes shortly after administration, or with intravenously administered M-1793 at 4 μg/ kg ­(C = 82 ng/mL; ­T = 0 h), which caused 2 emesis episodes (n=4 dogs/group).

**Conclusion:**
Combination of multiple NuSH with distinct mecha- nisms of action—here, analogues of GLP-1 and PYY—can achieve greater body weight loss. The long half-life of M-1793 supports dos- ing weekly or less frequently in humans, consistent with MET-097. Engineering the PK profile, specifically achieving long ­T and , of PYY analogues may promote greater tolerability without sacrific- ing efficacy.

**Background and aims:**
The prevalence of obesity and associated disorders necessitates innovative approaches for safe and efficacious therapies. This study aims to characterize PTT-A, a novel unimo- lecular tetra-agonist targeting GLP-1, GIP, amylin and calcitonin receptors in DIO rats and assess its efficacy against Tirzepatide, a GLP-1, GIP dual agonist.

**Materials and methods:**
DIO rats were dosed for 3 weeks with PTT-A or Tirzepatide and multiple endpoints were examined, includ- ing body weight (BW), food intake (FI), body composition by carcass analysis and MRI, metabolic parameters and liver health.

**Results:**
Treatment with PTT-A at 10 and 30 nmol/kg over 21 days resulted in significant reductions in cumulative food intake and BW (14.3±1.5% and 19.2±0.9% vs vehicle, respectively), driven by reductions in fat mass with no loss of muscle mass. Tirzepatide at 30 nmol/kg reduced BW by 12.1±0.8% vs vehicle, that was accom- panied with a decrease in both fat and muscle mass. Gastrocnemius and soleus muscle weights were reduced by approximately 26% with Tirzepatide. No reduction in either muscle weight was seen with PTT-A at same dose. Additionally, PTT-A exhibited robust efficacy in glucose and plasma lipid lowering, insulin sensitization and liver health, as evidenced by reductions in plasma aminotransferase, plasma lipids, hepatic triglycerides, and liver histology. These meta- bolic benefits surpassed Tirzepatide’s effects at equivalent doses. PTT-A represents a promising novel tetra-agonist that demonstrated enhanced efficacy in weight loss, glycemic control, insulin sensitization and liver health relative to Tirzepatide. The pro- found BW reduction was through fat while preserving the muscle. These findings show the potential of tetra-agonists as multifaceted therapeutic options for addressing the challenges of obesity-related metabolic disorders.

**Significant weight reduction with improved body composition and serum TG/TC by HDM1002, a novel oral small molecule GLP-1R agonist**

L. Guo

**Background and aims:**
Over the past two decades, GLP-1R agonists have achieved significant success in treating obesity. Multiple clini- cal trials have shown that when using GLP-1 agonists for weight loss, lean body mass (LBM) accounts for 25% to 40% of the total weight loss. Here, we investigated HDM1002, an orally bioavailable, potent, and highly selective small molecule GLP-1R agonist, on the changes in body composition (Fat mass/LBM), serum total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG).

**Materials and methods:**
The TR-FRET cAMP production assay was used to evaluate the species biological activity difference of HDM1002. The HTRF method and the FLIPR Calcium 6 assay were used to assess the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the calcium mobilization induced by HDM1002, respectively. Based on the results of the HDM1002 species biological activity difference test, we conducted a non-clinical pharmacodynamics study using hGLP-1R transgenic mice (C57BL/6J-GLP-1R). C57BL/6J-GLP-1R DIO mice were orally administered HDM1002 twice daily for 27 days. Subsequently, the effects on body weight, fat mass and leptin levels were evaluated and analyzed.

**Results:**
HDM1002 demonstrated potent activation of human GLP- 1R with maximum activation effects ­(E ) comparable to those of endogenous GLP-1(7-37), confirming its role as a full agonist of GLP-1R. Compared with endogenous GLP-1(7-37), HDM1002 dis- played lower ­E values in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and calcium mobilization. The above results demonstrated that HDM1002 was a biased agonist (Biased to cAMP pathway). The study identified monkey as pharmacologically relevant species for HDM1002, and HDM1002 had almost no activity on GLP-1R in mouse, rat and dog. Continuously administered at doses of 5-40 mg/kg twice daily for 27 days, HDM1002 significantly reduced the body weight of C57BL/6J-GLP-1R DIO mice, with a maximum reduction of 18.9%. Correspondingly, HDM1002 significantly reduced the fat content in C57BL/6J-GLP-1R DIO mice, including mesenteric fat, epididymal fat, and perirenal fat, with the maximum fat-reduction ratio of 53.6%. Furthermore, HDM1002 did not affect the muscle content of the mice, indicating that the observed weight loss is mainly driven by fat mass loss rather than LBM in DIO mice. Moreover, HDM1002 at doses ranging from 20 to 40 mg/kg significantly reduced serum TC and TG levels, and ameliorated the lipid metabolism disorder in C57BL/6J-GLP-1R DIO mice.

**Conclusion:**
HDM1002 is a potent, orally bioavailable, and cAMP- biased GLP-1R small molecule full agonist. Preclinical studies demon- strate that HDM1002 effectively promotes weight loss by reducing fat body mass while preserving lean body mass, and significantly improves serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. These findings suggest that HDM1002 may serve as a promising therapeutic option for obesity. Currently, HDM1002 has progressed to phase 3 clinical trials for weight loss, including the LBM changes.

**Background and aims:**
Amylin is a hormone co-secreted from pan- creatic beta cells in a fixed ratio with insulin. Amylin causes satiation by activating receptors in the brain, leading to reduced food intake, delayed gastric emptying and body weight loss. Selective amylin recep- tor-agonists (SARAs) and dual amylin calcitonin receptor-agonists (DACRAs) have been shown to cause significant body weight loss in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Here, we describe the profiling of a synthetic SARA, AZD6234, with selectivity mimicking endogenous amylin in comparison to DACRA or glucagon-like peptide-1R agonist (GLP-1RA) peptides in rodent models of aversion, gastric emptying and body weight loss.

**Materials and methods:**
AZD6234, DACRA or GLP-1R agonist pep- tide were profiled across several in vivo rat models. Lean rats were used to evaluate saccharin water conditioned taste aversion (CTA). High-fat diet fed obese (DIO) rats were used to evaluate gastric emptying (GE) as measured by X-ray fluoroscopic quantification. DIO rats were also used to evaluate food intake, body weight-lowering and body composi- tion effects.

**Results:**
Single administration of AZD6234 (3, 20 or 60 nmol /kg) or DACRA peptide (0.3, 3, or 30 nmol /kg) were used to establish dose- response relationship in the rat CTA test. The potency ­(ED value) for AZD6234 and DACRA was 30 nmol/kg and approximately 10 nmol/ kg respectively. Aversion correlated strongly to in vitro rat calcitonin receptor potency but not to rat amylin receptor potency. In a repeat dose DIO rat GE study using sub-maximal doses of AZD6234 (2 nmol/kg), GLP-1RA (2 nmol/kg) or their combination, revealed that AZD6234, unlike GLP-1RA, maintained GE delay beyond 7 days of treatment. The GLP-1RA and AZD6234 combination resulted in an enhanced acute effect on GE. AZD6234 injected s.c. at 2.5 or 10 nmol/kg, or DACRA at 1, 3, 10, or 20 nmol/kg over a 4-week study in DIO rats resulted in dose-dependent reduction in body weight compared to vehi- cle-treated rats of -5.2 ± 0.6 and -9.7 ± 0.7 %, and -3 ± 0.6, -5.3 ± 1.1, -8.8 ± 1.4 and -11.6 ± 0.9 %, respectively and a reduction of cumula- tive food intake of -14.3 ± 1.2 and -20.9 ± 0.7 % , and -7.1 ± 2.1, -16 ± 2.5, -23.9 ± 3.5 and -23.7 ± 1.1 % of vehicle, respectively. Body- composition measurements showed that AZD6234, unlike DACRA, promoted fat-mass-specific body weight loss while preserving fat free mass. The greatest fat-mass loss observed for AZD6234 10 nmol/kg of -28.0 ± 2.3 g which was nearly double that observed for matched body weight loss with DACRA 10 nmol/kg of -15.5 ± 6.0 g fat. Lean- mass loss correlated with the degree of calcitonin receptor engagement for DACRA, while fat-mass loss correlated with the degree of amylin receptor engagement.

**Conclusion:**
Our data indicate that AZD6234, a potent SARA, elicited fat-mass specific weight loss with preservation of lean-mass in DIO rats. In lean rats, aversion correlated to calcitonin receptor engagement and in DIO rats lean mass loss also correlated to calcitonin receptor engagement. AZD6234 mediated significant delay in gastric emptying which unlike GLP-1RA was maintained beyond 7 days. AZD6234 has the potential of providing efficacious and tolerable fat-specific weight reduction for people living with overweight or obesity.

**Optimising American Diabetes Association’s ABC target (HbA1c, blood pressure, and LDL-C) achievement in type 2 diabetes through lifestyle interventions: an Indian study**

D. Tiwari, ­Kathrikolly, M. ­Ganla, B. ­Saboo

1. Freedom from Diabetes Research Foundation, Pune, India, Diabe-

**Background and aims:**
Achieving ABC targets (A1c < 7%, blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg, LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dL) is vital for managing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and reducing cardiovascular risks. However, only 7.7% of T2D patients in India meet these criteria as per the ICMR-INDIAAB data. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a one-year intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and examined the roles of body mass index (BMI), weight loss, and insulin sensitivity in achieving ABC targets.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from 1857 adult T2D patients (not on insulin) enrolled in a one-year online lifestyle program at Diabetes Management Clinic in India were analyzed. The intervention com- prised personalized plant-based diet, physical activity, and psycho- logical and medical support. Outcomes included ABC target achieve- ment, assessment of anthropometric and biochemical improvements, and T2D remission. Logistic regression identified predictors of ABC target achievement.

**Results:**
The mean age and median diabetes duration were 52.5±9.4 years and 9.0(4.4-14.2) years, respectively; 65% were male. At baseline, 90.6%, 56.1%, and 48.7% of the patients were receiving pharmacological treatment for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hyper- tension, respectively. Further, despite pharmacological interven- tion, the percentage of patients achieving all three ABC targets was 16%; two targets were 38%, and one target was 36.9%; 9.1% did not achieve any target. Post-intervention, significant improvements were observed in the percentage of patients achieving all three ABC targets (26%) and meeting at least two targets (48%) (p<0.001). In the overall cohort, significant post-intervention improvements were observed in median weight [-5.0%], BMI [-5.0%], HbA1c [-11.0%], fasting insulin [-12.3%], fasting blood glucose [-6.8%], blood pres- sure (systolic [-2.0], diastolic [-1.0%]), LDL-cholesterol [-2.4%], triglycerides [-10.7%], HDL-cholesterol [7.0%], and HOMA-IR [-20.4%] (p<0.05). T2D remission was observed in 25.6% of the patients. Following the intervention, 42.7%, 25.7%, and 13.4% of patients no longer required medication for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that male gender, weight loss>10%, baseline BMI<25 kg/m , and baseline HOMA-IR<2.5 were significant predictors associated with achieving all three ABC targets in patients with T2D (Fig1).

**Conclusion:**
Structured ILI significantly improved ABC target achievement, reduced medication dependency, and enhanced met- abolic control; key predictors included gender, weight loss, BMI, and HOMA-IR. Broader implementation of such programs may help enhance diabetes care outcomes.

**Impact of an integrated lifestyle intervention on body composition and type 2 diabetes remission: the key role of visceral fat reduction**

P. Tripathi, ­Kathrikolly, M. ­Ganla, B. ­Saboo

1. Freedom from Diabetes Research Foundation, Pune, India, Diabetes

**Background and aims:**
Lifestyle management for type 2 diabetes (T2D) emphasizes weight loss, particularly in individuals with obe- sity. This study evaluated the effects of a one-year integrated lifestyle intervention on body composition and diabetes remission in patients with T2D and obesity, identifying key contributing factors.

**Materials and methods:**
The study analyzed retrospective data of 666 T2D patients with obesity (aged>18 years, BMI>25 kg/m ) who participated in a one-year integrated lifestyle intervention program at a diabetes management clinic in Pune, India. Data on medical history, biochemical parameters, and bioimpedance analysis (weight, BMI, total body fat, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, and skeletal muscle mass using a Karada scan) were extracted from medical records. The intervention encompassed 1) plant-based diet, intermittent and water fasting; 2) targeted muscle activation and strengthening, flexibility training, and stamina-building exercises; 3) psychological interventions to gener- ate positive energy and relieve stress; and 4) medical management. Statistical analyses were done (SPSS 21) using nonparametric test like Spearman rho test for correlation, Mann Whitney test to find significant difference between two groups, and binary logistic regression (univari- ate and multivariate) to access the predictors of remission.

**Results:**
At baseline, mean age, diabetes duration, BMI, and total fat% were 56.3±10.4 years, 13.9±6.7 years, 29±3.5 kg/m2, and 34.7±5.9, respectively; most were taking oral hypoglycemic agents (95.9%). Post-intervention, weight change was positively correlated with total fat (r=0.534), including subcutaneous (r=0.582), and vis- ceral fat (r=0.664), and inversely associated with skeletal muscle mass (r=-0.428) (p<0.001). Diabetes remission (HbA1c <6.5% for three months without medication) was achieved in 18.5% of par- ticipants, accompanied by significant improvements in HbA1c and weight (p<0.001). Compared to the non-remission group, those in remission exhibited greater reductions in weight (-10.1% vs. -4.5%), body fat (-7.2% vs. -3.9%), visceral fat (-20.8% vs. -12%), subcu- taneous fat (-9.3% vs. -5.1%), and increased skeletal muscle mass (3.3% vs. 2.1%) (p<0.001). Univariate analysis identified reductions in total fat (>10%), subcutaneous fat (>5%), visceral fat (>10%), and increased skeletal muscle mass (>5%) as significant factors for remission (p<0.001). Logistic regression indicated that a >10% reduction in visceral fat was the strongest predictor of diabetes remis- sion (p<0.01), while other factors were not statistically significant.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the pivotal role of visceral fat reduction in achieving diabetes remission. These findings underscore the importance of body composition changes beyond weight loss in lifestyle interventions for T2D management.

**Efficacy and feasibility of intermittent versus time-restricted or continuous calorie restriction in managing obesity and type 2 diabetes**

H. Zhang

**Background and aims:**
The 5:2 intermittent fasting regimen has shown promise as an effective strategy for blood glucose control and weight management, but direct evidence comparing it to 10-hour time-restricted eating (TRE) in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes remains limited. This study aims to compare the effects of intermittent energy restriction (IER), TRE and continuous energy restriction (CER) on blood glucose and body weight in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
This study was a single-center, rand- omized, parallel-controlled trial conducted at the First Affili- ated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from November 19, 2021 to November 7, 2024. A total of 90 eligible patients were ran- domly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the IER, TRE or CER group, with consistent weekly caloric intake across all three groups. The interventions were supervised and guided by a nutritionist over 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in glycated hemo- globin (HbA1c) levels, while secondary endpoints included blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, blood lipids, uric acid, liver enzymes, adverse event incidence and patient adherence (actual compli- ance with intervention frequency/theoretical frequency of dietary intervention).

**Results:**
A total of 63 patients completed the 16-week intervention (18 females, 45 males, average age 36.8 years, average disease dura- tion 1.5 years, baseline body mass index 31.7 kg/m², HbA1c 7.42%). At the end of the 16-week intervention, there were no significant dif- ferences in HbA1c reduction (-1.56% vs -1.44% vs -1.03%, = 0.23) and weight loss (-8.6 kg vs -8.2 kg vs -5.7 kg, = 0.39) between the IER, TRE and CER groups, although the absolute decrease in HbA1c and body weight was greatest in the IER group. Compared to TRE and CER, IER significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (-2.3 mmol/L [SD 1.51 mmol/L]) and triglycerides (-1.139 mmol/L [SD 1.335 mmol/L]) and increased the Matsuda index (80.23 [SD 70.69]) (all pairwise comparisons < 0.05). There were no differ- ences in the reduction of uric acid and liver enzymes from baseline among the three groups. Hypoglycemia occurred in 2 patients in the IER group, 2 patients in the TRE group, and 3 patients in the CER group. In terms of patient adherence, the IER group had the highest adherence rate (85%), followed by the CER group at 84% and the TRE group at 78%. Statistically significant differences were observed between the IER and CER groups versus the TRE group ( <0.05).

**Conclusion:**
IER, TRE and CER all effectively improved HbA1c levels in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The incidence of adverse events was similar across the three groups. However, IER demonstrated greater advantages in reducing fasting blood glucose, improving insulin sensitivity, lowering triglycerides and enhancing patient adherence.

**Background and aims:**
Various dietary approaches, such as continues calorie-restricted diets and, more recent, intermittent calorie-restricted diets have demonstrated success in weight management and glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. However, there are also concerns about disproportionate decrease in lean body mass and consequently of resting energy expenditure, with inconsistent results to date. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the effects of a 3-month intermittent calorie-restricted diet and continuous calorie-restricted diet on body composition, resting energy expenditure and diabetes regula- tion in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
People with type 2 diabetes and overweight/ obesity participating in two ongoing RCTs (E-DIET and TIMED trial) in the Netherlands were included in the current study, to determine the 3-month difference between two dietary interventions: intermittent calorie-restricted diet (eating window between 8am-6pm and 1300- 1500 kcal per day, ICR) and continuous calorie-restricted diet (800 kcal per day, CCR). Outcomes were body composition, resting energy expenditure and glycaemic control within and between the groups. (Non) parametric tests and linear regression analysis were performed for the statistical analysis of results.

**Results:**
Sixty-seven participants (mean age 60.2 years; 57% female; n=26 ICR; n=41 CCR) were included. After three months of inter- vention, weight, BMI, waist circumference and fat mass decreased significantly, while fat-free mass did not change in the CCR group and decreased in the ICR group (Table 1). There were no significant between-group differences in these parameters. Resting energy expend- iture was significantly lower after CCR compared to ICR (β=-160.23, p=0.021, 95% CI [-295,75, -24.71]). HbA1c decreased significantly only after three months CCR (p=0.028), while the diabetes medica- tion (Medication Effect Score) decreased significantly in both the ICR group and CCR group (p<0.001), indicating better diabetes control in both groups.

**Conclusion:**
Intermittent calorie-restricted and continuous calorie- restricted diets were beneficial in reducing weight and improving body composition and diabetes control after three months, with a better preservation of resting energy expenditure during intermittent energy-restriction, indicating a possible benefit for long-term weight management.

4. pital Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany, University Hospital Coventry,

**Background and aims:**
Epidemiological studies suggest, that insolu- ble cereal fiber has multiple positive effects on human health. Increased intake is associated with lower risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. The randomised-controlled Optimal Fiber Trial - conducted with prediabetes patients between 2010 and 2014 - showed a dose-dependent effect of insoluble oat fiber on postprandial glucose as well as additional effects on HbA1c and CRP. Subjects with combined impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose toler- ance - a prediabetes subphenotype especially associated with obesity and NAFLD - showed the strongest benefit, which facilitated further research on that topic. The NIMROD study investigates, whether insol- uble oat fiber may reduce liver fat content and improve glycometabolic as well as inflammatory outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.

**Materials and methods:**
We recruited patients from 18 to 75 years of age with insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes and concomitant NAFLD. The participants underwent a 12-week intervention consisting of sup- plementation with a triple-blinded drinking powder, which provided 7,5 grams of insoluble oat fiber per day or placebo (maltodextrin) twice daily. Beside supplementation, patients were asked to maintain overall diet and physical activity. The study utilized routine blood analyses, a mixed-meal tolerance test, anthropometry including body composition as well as magnetic-resonance tomography and spectroscopy for body fat distribution and liver fat measurement, all of which were done at baseline and follow-up. Insulin sensitivity was measured with HOMA- IR and the Matsuda index. Adherence to supplementation, but also to maintained diet and exercise was assessed by food and supplement record, pedometer readings and biosamples. Statistical analysis used an ANCOVA following ITT- and as-treated-principles (alpha<0,05). Primary outcome is the change in liver fat content; secondary outcomes entail other major facettes of the metabolic syndrome.

**Results:**
94 participants (age 63 ± 10 years; BMI 31,3 ± 4,9 kg/m²; 48 % women) were randomized, 11 persons dropped out prematurely. After 12 weeks of intervention, there was no significant difference between fiber and placebo group for change in liver fat content (-0,2 ± 2,5 % vs. 0,2 ± 3,0 %; p=0,533; ITT). Furthermore, no significant dif- ferences were found for fasting and 2-h glucose, HOMA-IR, Matsuda- ISI, routine inflammatory and lipid outcomes as well as visceral fat content. The effect on HbA1c showed a trend towards benefit for the fiber group (-0,1 ± 0,3 % vs. 0,1 ± 0,4 %; p=0,052; ITT). Body weight, food intake and physical activity remained constant in both groups.

**Conclusion:**
Our data do not show a significant benefit by a 12-week supplementation with insoluble oat fiber in patients with type 2 dia- betes and NAFLD for any major metabolic outcome covering liver status, glucose metabolism or inflammation. This could be related to the relatively short intervention period or limited methodology for the assessment of insulin resistance. Otherwise, this particular type of fiber may just be without beneficial effect in this group of patients. Further research is needed.

**Postprandial testosterone levels in type 1 and type 2 diabetes fol- lowing standardised meals**

A. Elksnis

2. Stockholm, Sweden, Centrum for Diabetes, Academic Specialist Cen-

**Background and aims:**
Testosterone plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism. While lower tes- tosterone levels have been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D), studies on type 1 diabetes (T1D) have yielded conflicting results. Despite the distinct pathophysiology of T1D and T2D, testosterone levels may influence the development and progression of both conditions. Notably, there is a bidirectional relationship between testosterone and insulin, which may have implications for both short- and long-term metabolic control.Although it is well established that testosterone levels fluctuate in response to meals, the influence of meal composi- tion remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of different meal compositions on testosterone, sex hormone- binding globulin (SHBG), and insulin levels in individuals with dia- betes and healthy controls, with potential implications for dietary recommendations.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 25 male participants aged 26-67 (5 T1D, 10 T2D, 10 Controls) were included in the study. Each par- ticipant consumed four isocaloric lunch meals on separate occasions, differing in macronutrient composition. Blood samples were collected before and 120 minutes after the meals. The composition of the meals were: meal (18 % energy (E%) proteins, 28 E% fat and 54% carbohydrates), meal (18 E% protein, 50 E% fat and 31 E% carbohydrate), meal (40 E% protein, 30 E% fat and 30 E% carbohydrates) and meal (18 E% proteins, 28 E% fat and 54 E% carbohydrates and 15 gram of fibers).

**Results:**
At baseline, testosterone levels were approximately 20% higher in T1D subjects (p < 0.05) and 20% lower in T2D subjects (p < 0.05) compared to healthy controls. SHBG exhibited an inverse pattern, with levels nearly twice as high in T1D subjects and less than half in T2D subjects compared to controls (p < 0.001 for both). Postprandial analyses revealed that all meal compositions, except the high-fat meal, led to a significant decrease in testosterone levels in healthy controls (10-15% reduction, p < 0.05). In individuals with diabetes, only high- carbohydrate meals significantly reduced testosterone levels (16% in T2D, p < 0.05; 25% in T1D, p < 0.05), whereas the high-protein meal affected testosterone levels exclusively in T1D subjects (15% reduc- tion, p < 0.05).SHBG levels were marginally reduced (7.5%, p < 0.05) in controls following the high-carbohydrate meal, but remained unchanged in T1D and T2D subjects. Furthermore, testosterone levels correlated with insulin concentrations in both healthy controls (r² = 0.11, p < 0.01) and T2D subjects (r² = 0.10, p < 0.01).

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates that meal composition signifi- cantly influences testosterone levels in both individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. These findings suggest that dietary recommenda- tions for diabetes management should consider the potential metabolic effects of testosterone. Additionally, the observed differences in base- line testosterone and SHBG levels between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals may have implications for testosterone replacement therapy in these populations.

**Background and aims:**
The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of a 6-month protein-enriched diet for older Japa- nese people with diabetes who have low skeletal muscle mass.

**Materials and methods:**
This study employed a non-randomized, sin- gle-arm intervention trial design to examine the effects of a 6-month protein-enriched dietary intervention in older individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and low skeletal muscle mass. The intervention group received a protein-enriched dietary intervention for 6 months from April 2023 to December 2024. The inclusion criteria were follows: a) outpatients aged 65 years or older with T2D, b) skeletal muscle index (SMI) below the reference value (male < 7.0, female < 5.7), and c) pro- tein intake ≤ 1.2 g/kg/day. The protein-enriched intervention group was provided with food containing the equivalent of 10 g of protein every day at breakfast, alongside their usual meals, without specialized sup- plements. The primary outcome was change in lean body mass (LBM), and secondary outcomes were change in HbA1c and eGFR. Changes in protein intake and LBM were assessed using 3-day food records and bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody S10). In addition, this study retrospectively set up a control group (routine dietary intervention) and compared outcomes between the two dietary intervention approaches to verify the efficacy and safety of the protein-enriched intervention. The control group was retrospectively selected from patients who visited our hospital between April 2017 and March 2023, who met the inclu- sion criteria and had complete data.

**Results:**
A total of 72 subjects was evaluated (43 in the intervention group and 29 in the control group). There were no significant differ- ences between the two groups regarding baseline age, gender, BMI, SMI, protein intake. After 6 months of intervention, the intervention group showed no decline in LBM, whereas the control group exhibited significant reduction, with a notable difference in the change between the groups (P<0.05). Remarkably, while protein intake increased significantly in both groups, the degree of increase was significantly greater in the intervention group. HbA1c tended to increase in the intervention group, while eGFR showed no significant change in either group. In addition, we performed the multiple regression analysis set- ting changes in LBM as the dependent variables, with age, gender, BMI, type of intervention as independent variables. As a result, we found that the type of intervention (intervention group) is the independ- ent determinant contributing to the improvement of LBM.

**Conclusion:**
The findings of this study suggest that the dietary interven- tion to incorporate protein-enriched foods into breakfast may contribute to prevent the loss of LBM in Japanese older individuals with T2D and low skeletal muscle mass. Notably, since protein enrichment rendered in this study was achieved using commercially available foods rather than special- ized nutritional supplements, this approach offers significant advantages in terms of feasibility and safety.

**Background and aims:**
a beneficial relationship between physical activity and kidney function has been established in epidemiology, but intervention studies are scarce. The high-intensity physical activ- ity (HIPA) strategy has never been specifically evaluated regarding kidney function.

**Materials and methods:**
ActiDiaNe is a randomized, controlled trial including people with type 2 diabetes (pT2D) with rapid decline in renal function (eGFR slope less than -5 ml/min/year, in the 3-24 pre- vious months). Subjects were randomized to HIPA vs physical activ- ity advice (STD), with the intervention lasting 2 years. HIPA-group patients attended commercial sports centers with 2 sessions of at least 60 minutes per week or could also use web-based HIPA sessions (particularly during COVID-19 lock-down) after appropriate material was sent to them. Coaches had a systematic training proposed by the ACTIDIANE Sport Committee.

**Results:**
In 21 centers, 178 people were selected, 122 randomized and 103 (29 women/74 men) were available for the primary endpoint: 59 HIPA vs 44 STD. At randomization, age was 66 ± 9 years (mean +/- SD), cys-eGFR was 54 ml/min/1.73m2 (37; 65) [median (25°; 75° per- centile)], the slope of decline in renal function was -9 ml/min/year (-12; -7).During the study, which was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemics, in the HIPA group, the median time between randomization and attendance to the first HIPA session was 61 days (17-146). Only 4/59 HIPA participants did not perform any PA session and 7/59 per- formed more than half of the prescribed sessions, during each 6-month time period following randomisation. The primary endpoint was the slope of the decline in renal function estimated by the glomerular fil- tration rate estimated by the measurement of Cystatin C (cys-eGFR). Using a linear mixed model on an intention-to-treat population, the decline in cys-eGFR (primary endpoint) was -2.04 ml/min/year in the HIPA arm vs -2.76 ml/min in the STD arm (p=0.442). There was no significant safety issue regarding serious adverse events, hypoglycemia and musculo-skeletal disorders.

**Conclusion:**
In pT2, with rapid decline in renal function, HIPA was very hard to implement. It was safe but did not significantly modify the decline in renal function vs STD.

1. Preventive and Social Medicine, JIPMER, Puducherry, India, Obstetrics

**Background and aims:**
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is among the most common medical conditions during pregnancy, affecting approximately 17% of pregnancies globally. In India, the prevalence of GDM ranges from 10% to 14.5%, with even higher rates reported in regions such as Tamil Nadu (18.5%). Effective manage- ment of GDM relies significantly on adherence to medical nutrition therapy (MNT), yet various socio-cultural, dietary, and practical fac- tors can influence this adherence. This qualitative study explores the facilitators, and barriers encountered by pregnant women with GDM following a predominantly millet-based dietary intervention, aiming to provide deeper understanding to enhance adherence and inform clini- cal practice.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted in-depth interviews with 12 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM who were receiving care at a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry from August to December 2023. Participants included six women from the enhanced MNT group (low glycemic index diet) and six from the predominant mil- let-based MNT group. Within each dietary group, three adherent and three non-adherent participants were purposefully selected to explore facilitators and barriers to dietary adherence. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and a hybrid coding approach combin- ing inductive and deductive methods was employed. Codes derived from the data were systematically organized into overarching themes guided by the Health Belief Model to facilitate comprehen- sive qualitative analysis.

**Results:**
Facilitators of adherence to MNT included perceived benefits of the diet and its impact on glycemic control, usefulness of health education booklets, awareness of the importance of physical activity, perceived susceptibility due to previous history of GDM, counsel- ling received from private clinics, knowledge about diabetes mellitus, perceived severity such as fear of excess weight gain, caesarean sec- tion, uncontrolled blood glucose, and cues to action including fam- ily support and diet charts. Barriers identified were lack of awareness regarding symptoms of GDM, inability to locate dietitians, first-time pregnancy experiences, lack of availability and cost of recommended food items, taste preferences, cooking difficulties, family responsibili- ties, and occupational demands.

**Conclusion:**
This qualitative study has highlighted critical facilita- tors and barriers influencing adherence to MNT interventions among pregnant women with GDM. Major barriers such as lack of awareness and insufficient family support affect dietary adherence. Enhancing the healthcare delivery system, increasing awareness through tar- geted education, and implementing practical tools like health educa- tion booklets could substantially improve adherence to MNT, thereby optimizing glycemic control and maternal health outcomes in GDM management.

**Background and aims:**
A ketotic state in pregnant women have been associated with low-birth weight and developmental disorders in offspring. This interventional study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietitian-led medical nutrition therapy (MNT) on neonatal outcomes in Japanese women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with and without ketonuria.

**Materials and methods:**
Women diagnosed with GDM underwent blood and urine examinations 2-h after breakfast between 24 and 37 weeks of gestation from 2012 to 2023 at Kajiyama Clinic in Japan. All participants received individualized MNT from dietitians. Dietary counseling emphasized a "food order" in which vegetables were con- sumed first, followed by the main dish (protein), and carbohydrates last to mitigate postprandial glucose excursions. Additionally, "divided meal consumption" (4-5 meals per day) was recommended, particularly encouraging carbohydrate intake between lunch and dinner to stabi- lize postprandial glycemic responses. Dietary counseling sessions were conducted twice in the first month and then monthly for 2-3 months. Maternal background and neonatal outcomes were compared between the ketonuria and non-ketonuria groups.

**Results:**
Among 517 women with GDM [age: 33 years (median)], 143 (27.7%) exhibited ketonuria. The 1-h OGTT value was significantly higher in the ketonuria group ( < 0.05), whereas age, pre-pregnancy BMI, HbA1c, GA, and family history of type 2 diabetes showed no sig- nificant differences between the two groups. The prevalence of ketonu- ria was 37% in underweight women (BMI <18.5), 25% in those with normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI <25.0), and 30% in overweight women (BMI ≥25.0). After diagnosis, it took approximately 2 to 4 weeks to receive MNT. Weight gain during pregnancy tended to be lower in the ketonuria group than in the non-ketonuria group (6.8 kg vs. 7.3 kg, = 0.093). Energy and carbohydrate intake were significantly lower in the ketonuria group than in the non-ketonuria group both before and after diagnosis. Following GDM diagnosis, energy and carbohydrate intake decreased in both groups (1305 to 957 kcal, 172.2 to 122.0 g in the ketonuria group; 1659 to 1275 kcal, 223.0 to 149.9 g in the non- ketonuria group). However, following MNT, energy and carbohydrate intake significantly increased in both groups (1501 kcal, 173.1 g in the ketonuria group; 1531 kcal, 177.2 g in the non-ketonuria group), with no cases of ketonuria thereafter. Birth weight (3072 g vs. 3013 g), cesarean section rates, and the incidence of congenital anomalies did not differ significantly between the two groups. Additionally, none of the women with GDM required insulin therapy.

**Conclusion:**
Young women in Japan have a high prevalence of underweight and low-birth weight infants. Many women with GDM strive to keep their blood glucose levels within the target range and aim to avoid insulin therapy. This often resulted in inadequate carbo- hydrate intake due to excessively low-carbohydrate diets. Dietitian- led MNT incorporating the "food order"-consuming vegetables first and carbohydrates last-along with "divided meal consumption" not only improved postprandial glucose excursions and resolved ketonu- ria but also contributed to favorable neonatal outcomes in Japanese women with GDM.

2. Latvia, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Latvia, Riga,

**Background and aims:**
Diet may play a crucial role in preventing diabetes and prediabetes. The aim of this study was to examine how dietary pattern differences vary between individuals with different degrees of insulin resistance.

**Materials and methods:**
Raw time-series data obtained from the diag- nostic CGM applied for 14 days (Libre ProIQ, Abbott) were available for 60 study participants. Inclusion criteria were adults with normal glucose metabolism (fasting glucose <5,6 mmol/l and HbA1c<5,7%), as well as body mass index (BMI) 25-34.9 kg/m2. The time-series data were divided into 24-hour segments (977 24 in total), each consisting of 96 observations, and clustered using k-medoids with DTW distance. The optimal number of clusters (three) was determined based on the average silhouette width and the Calinski-Harabasz index. A Food Fre- quency Questionnaire (FFQ), 3-day dietary records, and 24-hour recall were used for dietary data collection. Biochemical blood analysis was measured in a certified clinical lab.

**Results:**
Three groups of subjects were formed based on clustering results: Group 1 ( = 23), Group 2 ( = 18), and Group 3 ( = 19). Indi- viduals in all three groups did not differ in age, BMI, waist-to-height ratio, or smoking prevalence. However, the groups differed significantly in parameters related to insulin resistance. The median levels of serum C-peptide, triglycerides and average glucose were the highest in group 1 and the lowest in group 3. On the contrary, high-density lipoprotein levels and time spent in tight range were the lowest in group 1 and the highest in group 3. In Group 2, energy (p = 0.042), carbohydrate (p = 0.045), and grain intake (p = 0.037) were statistically significantly higher. In Group 1, fat intake (rs = -0.582, p = 0.004) and energy intake (rs = -0.436, p = 0.038) were negatively correlated with high-sensi- tivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. Ceruloplasmin levels were negatively correlated with fat (rs = -0.473, p = 0.023), carbohydrate (rs = -0.430, p = 0.041), and energy intake (rs = -0.446, p = 0.033) in Group 1. In Group 1, fasting glucose levels were negatively correlated with grain (rs = -0.435, p = 0.038), vegetable (rs = -0.399, p = 0.059), and milk and dairy product consumption (rs = -0.408, p = 0.053). Additionally, in Group 1, higher fruit and berry intake was positively correlated with HDL levels (rs = 0.442, p = 0.035). Positive correla- tions were also found between dried fruit intake and ceruloplasmin (rs = 0.469, p = 0.024), and hs-CRP levels (rs = 0.409, p = 0.053) in Group 1. In Group 2, alcohol consumption was positively correlated with BMI (rs = 0.523, p = 0.026) and C-peptide levels (rs = 0.589, p = 0.010). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were negatively cor- related with sweets and soft drink consumption (rs = -0.557, p = 0.020) in Group 2. In Group 3, negative correlations were found between fruit and berry intake and C-peptide levels (rs = -0.602, p = 0.006), vegeta- ble consumption and LDL levels (rs = -0.501, p = 0.029), grain intake and triglyceride levels (rs = -0.481, p = 0.037), and hs-CRP levels and coffee, tea, and hot drink intake (rs = -0.454, p = 0.051).

**Conclusion:**
These preliminary results highlight the need for person- alized dietary changes to reduce insulin resistance and improve lipid profiles.

**Late-life caloric restriction reduces insulin secretory demand and alters islet immune composition by limiting antigen presentation and t-lymphocyte infiltration**

R. Arrojo e Drigo, Ferguson

**Background and aims:**
Caloric restriction (CR) can extend organ- ismal lifespan and/or healthspan, and some of these effects rely on improved peripheral insulin sensitivity. We have shown that young adult mice exposed to CR for 2 months reduces the demand for beta cell insulin release and prolongs beta cell longevity. However, whether CR triggers similar responses in beta cells from old aging mice remains unknown. Therefore, our main goal was to investigate the impact of calorie restriction on the functional and molecular signatures of beta cells in aged mice and non-human primates (NHP).

**Materials and methods:**
First, we exposed 70-week-old C57BL/6J male mice to 20% CR for two months. Next, we assessed mouse in vivo glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity via oral mixed metal toler- ance tests, and performed single nucleus sequencing to determine the impact of CR on mouse islet transcriptional regulation. We also identi- fied higher order transcription regulatory elements by reconstructing gene regulatory networks for alpha and beta cells in CR mice. Next, we performed high resolution confocal microscopy to validate our snRNA-seq results. Finally, we performed similar imaging experiments to quantify changes in the exocrine pancreas and islets from non-human primates maintained on CR for an entire lifetime.

**Results:**
Aged mice exposed to CR exhibited improved glucose toler- ance and insulin sensitivity, which correlated with a twofold reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and lower beta cell mass. At the molecular level, CR increased islet autophagy, and altered the tran- scriptional profile of both alpha and beta cells. This was marked by a significant down-regulation of antigen presentation pathways in alpha cells, and ER-dependent protein processing in beta cells. This means that CR reduced the number of adaptive immune cells in and around the islet, including antigen-presenting dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, and a threefold decrease in islet T cells marked by a near elimination of cytotoxic ­CD8 T cells. Moreover, intercellular communication net- work analysis revealed a loss of cell-to-cell communication between antigen-presenting cells, adaptive immune (B and T lymphocytes), and alpha cells. Strikingly, CR induced a similar anti-inflammatory effect on the NHP pancreas, which experienced reduced islet fibrosis and amyloid deposition signatures.

**Conclusion:**
These findings highlight how CR reshapes islet endocrine cell function, fibrosis, and the immune landscape, which mitigates age- dependent immune activation and islet inflammation, and enhances metabolic health span.

5. cine, Hang Zhou, China, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.

**Background and aims:**
Advances in omics technologies enable profil- ing of proteomics and metabolomics alterations, elucidating biological pathways that link diet to disease. However, most studies have focused on a single omics layer, and rarely integrated data from diverse popu- lations. We leverage four cohorts (UKB, NEO, GNHS, and 10K) to examine associations among dietary patterns, multi-omics biomarkers, and cardiometabolic disease.

**Materials and methods:**
In each cohort, we performed linear regres- sion analyses to identify proteins and metabolites associated with either of the five dietary patterns and cardiometabolic disease. We estimated disease risk associated with each dietary pattern and omics markers using Cox’s proportional hazard regression models. For markers asso- ciated with both diet and disease, mediation analyses quantified pro- portions mediated. Models were adjusted for potential confounders, with false discovery rate corrections applied to correct for multiple comparisons.

**Results:**
We identified twenty three proteins significantly associated with at least one dietary pattern across cohorts. Notably, three proteins (LILRB4, CD22, and GZMA) consistently correlated with dietary pat- terns and disease risk, although they mediated only a modest fraction of the observed effects. In contrast, among the numerous metabolites linked to both dietary patterns and cardiometabolic outcomes, fifteen were consistently associated with all dietary scores. HDL particles emerged as the top mediators, underscoring their potential role in trans- lating dietary exposures into clinical risk.

**Conclusion:**
Our integrative multi omics analysis across diverse populations identifies novel biomarkers that connect dietary patterns with cardiometabolic risk. These findings deepen our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying diet related disease and hold promise for enhancing developing precision nutrition interventions. Future studies should validate these biomarkers and explore their utility in personalized dietary recommendations.

**Background and aims:**
High consumption of Ultra Processed Foods (UPF) has been associated with an increased risk of obesity. Whether lowering UPF intake during a Combined Lifestyle Intervention (CLI) is helpful in combating obesity is not yet known. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of UPF intake and anthro- pometric/metabolic parameters, stress and eating behaviour during a 1.5-year CLI.

**Materials and methods:**
Data of 126 adults living with obesity under- going a CLI with cognitive behavioural therapy at the Obesity Cen- tre CGG, Rotterdam, The Netherlands was collected at start, after 10 weeks and 1.5 years. Food intake was measured by a 3-day food diary. To quantify UPF intake, the records were classified into the four NOVA categories, based on total consumed energy. Anthropometric and meta- bolic parameters were measured at the outpatient clinic using standard clinical procedures. Both biological (cortisol and cortisone in hair) and perceived (Perceived Stress Scale) stress levels were measured. Eating behavior was assessed using the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire and the General Food Craving Questionnaire Trait. Marginal mixed models were performed to explore associations between UPF intake and the outcomes at all three timepoints, corrected for age and sex.

**Results:**
After 1,5-year CLI, the participants lost a mean of 6.6 kg of weight (p<0.001). UPF intake decreased significantly from 57,5% at baseline to 52.8% after 1.5 years (p=0.002). Also, an increase in unprocessed food intake was observed from 29.0% to 35.9% (p<0.001). UPF intake was positively associated with fat mass (estimate=0.033, p=0.016), perceived stress scores (estimate=0.061, p=0.05), external eating (estimate=0.006; p=0.018) at alle time points. UPF intake was also positively associated with BMI (estimate=0.034, p<0.001), waist circumference (estimate=0.134, p<0.001) and negatively associated with restrained eating behavior (estimate=-0.008, p<0.003). These changes were significantly over time: a decrease in UPF was asso- ciated with an increase in restrained eating behaviour (estimate= 0; p=0.05) and a decrease in BMI and waist circumference (estimate = -0.001; p=0.042 and estimate = -0.002 p=0.003, respectively). No associations were observed between UPF and blood pressure, glucose, insulin, percentage lean mass, biological stress measures emotional eating and food cravings.

**Conclusion:**
We found that a CLI led to significant weight loss, which was associated with a reduction in UPF intake. A lower UPF intake over time was associated with lower BMI, waist circumference and more restrained eating. Whether actively advising on reduction in UPF in a CLI can lead to better outcomes deserves further study.

**Sweet Cure? Mannose reverses beta cell dysfunction and improves glucose metabolism in diabetes**

S. Ma, L. ­Song

2. Xi’an, China, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China.

**Background and aims:**
Mannose, a naturally occurring hexose sugar existing in various fruits and vegetables, influences cellular glucose metabolism and has been shown to mitigate type 2 diabe- tes mellitus (T2DM) progression by enhancing regulatory T (Treg) cell function. However, its direct effects on pancreatic β-cell func- tion remain unclear. Progressive β-cell dysfunction in diabetes is linked to impaired mitochondrial metabolism and a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Given these metabolic changes, we investigated whether mannose could restore β-cell func- tion by modulating glucose metabolism and activating key metabolic regulators.

**Materials and methods:**
To model healthy and diabetic islets, INS-1 insulin-secreting cells were cultured under normal (5 mM glucose) and diabetic (25 mM glucose) conditions for 48 hours. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assays were conducted following treatment with 20 mM hexoses, including mannose, galac- tose, and fructose. Cellular metabolic activity was assessed using Seahorse extracellular flux analysis, where extracellular acidifica- tion rate (ECAR) was measured as an indicator of glycolysis, and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was analyzed to assess mitochon- drial respiration. Additionally, Western blotting was performed to evaluate the phosphorylation status of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism.

**Results:**
Diabetic β-cells exhibited a significant reduction in insulin secretion and content compared to normal β-cells following glu- cose stimulation, with a 2.5-fold decrease in insulin secretion and a 5.4-fold decline in insulin content ( < 0.05). Seahorse analysis revealed metabolic dysfunction in diabetic β-cells, characterized by an increased ECAR, indicative of enhanced glycolysis, and a reduced OCR, reflecting impaired mitochondrial respiration ( < 0.05). Among the hexoses tested, only mannose significantly improved β-cell function, restoring GSIS in diabetic β-cells with a 1.9-fold increase in insulin secretion and a 4.3-fold increase in insu- lin content ( < 0.05). Notably, mannose had no observable effect on GSIS in normal β-cells. Seahorse data further demonstrated that mannose treatment lowered ECAR, indicating reduced glycolysis, and elevated OCR, suggesting improved mitochondrial function in diabetic β-cells. Mechanistically, Western blot analysis revealed a 6.7-fold decrease in phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK) levels in dia- betic β-cells compared to normal β-cells ( < 0.05), whereas man- nose treatment partially restored pAMPK expression, leading to a 4.3-fold increase ( < 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrate that diabetic β-cells undergo a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, resembling the Warburg effect observed in cancer cells. Mannose restores β-cell function by modulating glucose metabolism, reduc- ing glycolysis, and enhancing mitochondrial respiration, potentially through AMPK activation. Given its dual role in improving β-cell function and enhancing Treg-mediated immune regulation, man- nose may serve as a promising metabolic modulator for diabetes treatment.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes distress (DD) has been associated with both poorer self-care of diabetes and worse glycemic control. Food insecurity (FIS) occurs frequently in low to middle income coun- tries (LMICs), such as Bangladesh, where it impacts on 25% of the population, and individuals with FIS are twice as likely to have diabe- tes. FIS may elicit strong psychological responses that impair diabetes care and, are intuitively, likely to contribute to DD. We evaluated the causal relationship between FIS and DD in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Bangladesh.

**Materials and methods:**
1256 unselected individuals with T2D attend- ing diabetes clinics in 4 districts of Bangladesh were recruited. FIS status was evaluated using the validated USDA 18-item questionnaire (≥3 indicative of FIS). Participants completed the validated DDS-17 questionnaire for DD (scores of ≥2 indicative of moderate, and ≥3 of severe, distress). Participant characteristics were compared between FIS and DD subgroups using t-tests and chi-square test. A conceptual model of the assumed causal relationships between all potentially rel- evant variables was developed to identify potential confounders. The g-computation method was employed to estimate the average causal effect of FIS on DD, while controlling for financial status and location (rural or urban). Results are presented as mean (or median) ± SE and percentages.

**Results:**
58% of the participants were female, mean age was 51.2±0.4years, BMI 24.7±0.1kg/m2, duration of diabetes 7.3±0.2years and HbA1c of 9.8±0.1% [83.8±1.1mmol/mol]. 35% of participants reported FIS, while 50% reported DD (11% severe DD). HbA1c lev- els were higher in individuals with DD (10.4±0.2 % vs 9.3±0.1%, P<0.001) and FIS (10.2±0.2% vs 9.6±0.1%, P<0.001). DD was greater in those with FIS compared to those without FIS (median: 2.24±0.03 vs 1.82±0.02, P<0.001). The proportions of individuals experiencing emotional burden, physician related burden, regimen related, and inter- personal distress were also higher in those with FIS (P<0.001 for all; Table 1). The estimated average causal effect of FIS on the DD score was substantial, 0.40 (95%CI: 0.28-0.52, P<0.001), representing the estimated increase in the DD score due to FIS.

**Conclusion:**
FIS appears to increase DD in people with T2D in Bang- ladesh and should be regarded as a potential contributor to DD. The potential for a reduction in FIS to decrease DD and improve glycemic outcomes in LMICs warrants evaluation.

**Background and aims:**
Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a key factor in coronary microvascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We previously showed that 4-week treatment with sodium-glucose cotrans- porter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) dapagliflozin reduces EAT thickness by 19%, with 30% increase in coronary flow reserve (CFR), probably due to reduced EAT inflammation. We subsequently found that 30% increase in CRF was preserved over a 4-year treatment, but long-term effects on EAT remained unclear. We thus evaluated changes in EAT thickness after 4-yr dapagliflozin treatment in T2D patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).

**Materials and methods:**
Patients with T2D and stable CAD were enrolled in the DAPAHEART trial, a single-center, 4-week, rand- omized (1:1 dapagliflozin 10 mg/placebo), double-blind, controlled study. After 4 weeks, the placebo group also received dapagliflozin. All patients were followed-up over the 4-yr treatment. EAT thickness was measured via 13N-ammonia PET/CT at baseline and after 4 yrs. BMI was also monitored, and correlation with EAT thickness reduc- tion analyzed.

**Results:**
During the follow-up, the antidiabetic treatment remained stable, and both groups were metabolically well balanced. In the DAPA group (n=5), the 30% increase in CFR was sustained over 4 years (p=ns). A comparison between baseline and after 4-years follow-up in the DAPA group showed a 35% increase in CFR (p=0.09). The placebo group (n=4), after 4 years of dapagliflozin treatment, exhib- ited a 28.6% increase in CFR (p=0.07). EAT thickness significantly decreased across all patients over the 4 years (p = 0.03). In the DAPA group, a reduction in EAT thickness was observed but did not reach statistical significance (p=NS), likely due to the limited sample size. In the Placebo group, which started dapagliflozin treatment after the 4-week trial, EAT reduction was statistically significant (p=0.04). BMI also decreased in all patients (p=0.001), but no significant correlation was observed between BMI reduction and EAT thickness changes (R² = 0.0662; p = 0.5038), suggesting a direct effect of dapagliflozin on EAT metabolism independent of weight loss.

**Conclusion:**
obtained after 4 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment is main- tained after 4 years, confirming the previous published results in a new population. The sustained improvement in CFR may have important implications for the management and prognosis of patients with T2DM and CAD. Furthermore, the reduction in EAT thickness, independent of BMI changes, suggests a potential direct anti-inflammatory effect of dapagliflozin on epicardial adipose tissue. These findings reinforce the CV benefits of dapagliflozin and support its role in reducing CV risk in T2DM patients.

**Efficacy and safety of enavogliflozin as add-on in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with insulin or insulin with other antidiabetic drugs**

**Background and aims:**
Glycemic control in people with a prolonged history of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is challenging due to progressive loss of pancreatic beta-cell function. In such a clinical setting, a sodium glu- cose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor may bring therapeutic benefit due to its insulin-independent mechanism of action. A phase 3 clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enavogliflo- zin as an add-on in adults with T2D inadequately controlled with an insulin-based regimen.

**Materials and methods:**
In this multicenter, randomized, double- blinded clinical trial, people with T2D previously on basal or pre-mixed insulin and/or up to two other antidiabetic drugs (OADs) were enrolled to receive enavogliflozin 0.3 mg/day or matching placebo for 24 weeks after a 2-week placebo run-in period. Changes from baseline at Week 24 were analyzed for the following endpoints: HbA1c (primary end- point), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, total daily dose of insulin (TDDI), HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), urine glucose-creatinine ratio (UGCR). A mixed model for repeated measures was used for main efficacy analyses.

**Results:**
A total of 240 people with advanced T2DM were randomized equally into each group. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.62% and 8.60%, respectively, and more than 95% of the participants in both groups had been treated with a combination of insulin and OAD. A placebo- adjusted least-square mean (LSM) change in HbA1c at Week 24 was -0.92% (95% CI, -1.155 to -0.694; p<0.001), demonstrating the superi- ority of enavogliflozin to placebo in HbA1c reduction at Week 24. Sig- nificant reductions in FPG, body weight, and TDDI were observed at Week 24, with placebo-adjusted LSM changes of -32.4 mg/dL (95% CI: -41.83, -22.96; p<0.001), -1.30 kg (95% CI: -1.854, -0.755, p<0.001), and -1.3 unit (95% CI: -2.33, -0.32, p=0.010), respectively.Enavogliflo- zin significantly increased UGCR, a major pharmacodynamic marker of SGLT-2 inhibitors. A significant increase in HOMA-B was also observed, while no significant changes were noted with HOMA-IR or UACR. The incidence rate of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between the groups: 50.0% (95% CI: 40.74, 59.26) in the enavogliflozin group vs. 56.7% (95% CI: 47.31, 65.68) in the placebo group. Incidence of hypoglycemia was 29.2% and 22.5%, respectively. Infections in the genitourinary system occurred in 3.3% of the ena- vogliflozin group and 2.5% of the placebo group.

**Conclusion:**
Enavogliflozin appears an efficacious and safe add-on treatment option in patients whose T2DM is controlled inadequately with insulin alone or combined with other antidiabetic agents.

**Discontinuation of SGLT2i after an episode of urogenital infec- tion: a population-based matched cohort study of patients with type 2 diabetes**

C. Ljungberg, C. Vandenbroucke-Grauls, M. Dalager-Pedersen, H.T. Sørensen, M. Nørgaard, R.W. ­Thomsen

**Background and aims:**
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, SGLT2i discontinuation is common. Guidelines do not recommend SGLT2i discontinuation after genital tract infection (GTI) or urinary tract infection (UTI), but whether these infections affect therapy discontinuation is unknown. We investigated the impact of urogenital infections on SGLT2i discontinuation risk.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a population-based matched cohort study of new users of SGLT2is with type 2 diabetes in Den- mark from 2016 through 2021. Using hospital records and community pharmacy prescription data, we included all SGLT2i users with an incident UTI or GTI episode within the first year of SGLT2i initiation. The patients were matched 1:3 to SGLT2i users without infection by sex, age, SGLT2i treatment duration, and calendar year of SGLT2i initiation. SGLT2i discontinuation was defined as the absence of a new SGLT2i prescription within 60 days after the estimated end of supply. The index date was set as the last day of the prescription covering the infection/matched period including a 60-day grace period.

**Results:**
Among 68,277 new SGLT2i users, we included 5,892 patients with an incident UTI and 17,676 matched comparisons. The risk of SGLT2i discontinuation was 22.5% in UTI-exposed versus 14.4% in comparisons on day 1, corresponding to an excess risk of +8.1% (95% CI: 6.9, 9.3) in UTI-exposed. After one year, the risks of discontinuation were 40.7% among UTI-exposed and 28.8% in comparisons, with an excess risk of +11.8% (95% CI: 10.4, 13.3). For GTI, we included 1,330 patients with an incident GTI and 3,990 matched comparisons. On day one, discontinuation was 18.0% in GTI-exposed versus 15.7% in comparisons with an excess risk of +2.3% (95% CI: 0.0, 4.6). After one year, discontinuation risk increased to 44.0% in the GTI-exposed and 30.5% in comparisons with an excess risk of +13.5% (95% CI: 10.5, 16.5).The figure shows SGLT2i discontinuation risk after an episode to urogenital infec- tions. Jumps in discontinuation risk are due to standard prescription durations.

**Conclusion:**
Patients with type 2 diabetes who initiate SGLT2i and experience an episode of UTI or GTI have an increased risk of subse- quent SGLT2i discontinuation. The impact on early SGLT2i discon- tinuation risk was more pronounced for UTI than for GTI episodes. Despite guidelines recommending against discontinuation, many

**Background and aims:**
Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been widely used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with proven cardiovascular and renal benefits. How- ever, their use has been associated with a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including euglycemic DKA (euDKA), particularly in older adults with multiple comorbidities. This study aims to describe the characteristics of DKA cases associated with SGLT2i use in patients aged 65 and over, based on data from the French pharmacovigilance database.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective analysis was conducted on all cases of DKA reported with an SGLT2i as a suspected or interacting drug in patients aged 65 years and older. Cases were retrieved from 2020 onward. After excluding 16 patients due to miss- ing diagnostic data, 55 cases were analyzed. Patient characteristics, drug exposure, adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports, hospitalization details, and precipitating factors were examined. Statistical analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

**Results:**
The median patient age was 74.0 years (IQR: 69.0; 77.5), with a predominance of males (63.4%). The median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 8.0 (IQR: 6.0; 10.0), and polypharmacy was common, with a median of 9 drugs per patient. The most frequently prescribed SGLT2i was dapagliflozin (70.9%). DKA was reported as classical DKA in 52.7% of cases and euDKA in 30.9%. Infec- tions (36.4%), dehydration (20.0%), and fasting (18.2%) were the main precipitating factors. All cases required hospitalization, with 36.4% admitted to the ICU. Among ICU patients, 35.0% required orotracheal intubation and/or vasopressor therapy. One case (1.8%) resulted in death. Factors significantly associated with ICU admis- sion included younger age (71.3 vs. 75.4 years, p=0.009), lower pH at admission (p=0.003), and infection as a precipitating fac- tor (p=0.007; OR: 4.88). Chronic kidney disease was associated with rehabilitation admission (p=0.014), whereas heart failure was inversely associated with ICU admission (p=0.014).

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the clinical characteristics and risk factors of SGLT2i-associated DKA in older adults. Infections and severe acidosis were key predictors of ICU admission, while chronic kidney disease influenced post-hospitalization trajectories. The findings emphasize the importance of careful patient selection and monitoring to mitigate DKA risk in older patients receiving SGLT2i therapy.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are widely used for diabetes management and have large car- diovascular and renal benefits. However, concerns exist regarding their potential to increase diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) risk, particularly in the presence of infections such as COVID-19. We investigated whether SGLT2i use increases the hospitalisation risk for DKA in individuals with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in England, and explored risk factors, including interactions with COVID-19. Due to low incidence of DKA in T2DM, large scale studies on this association have been lacking. Using large national data sets we can investigate this rare but clinically significant outcome and assess potential drug-related risks.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a historical nested case-control study using electronic health records from the entire population of Eng- land (58M people; 4.8M with T2DM) within the NHS England Secure Data Environment. For each DKA case, up to ten controls (T2DM indi- viduals without prior DKA hospitalisation) were randomly selected, matching on age, sex, and diabetes diagnosis year. Conditional logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between SGLT2i use and DKA risk, adjusting for potential confounders. COVID-19 infection prior to the index date (DKA event) was included as an inter- action term.

**Results:**
Between April 2019 and December 2024, 33,785 individuals with T2DM were hospitalised with DKA, matched with 266,960 con- trols. The median age at diabetes diagnosis was 52 years (IQR 43-61), and at index date, 68 years (IQR 58-78). The cohort was predominantly White (75%) with 56% males and 44% females. SGLT2i use was sig- nificantly associated with an increased risk of DKA (adjusted OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.84-1.96, p < 0.001). An interaction between SGLT2i use and recent COVID-19 infection was observed (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.23-1.53), indicating an even higher DKA risk (OR = 2.60, 95% CI: 2.45-2.77) among this subgroup.An association was found between BMI and risk of DKA (OR = 0.40 [0.38-0.41] in people with obesity; 0.56 [0.54-0.58] in those slightly overweighted; and 2.07 [1.88-2.27] in underweighted group). A history of heart failure (OR: 1.79 [1.71-1.87]) and the use of antipsychotic medications (OR: 1.86 [1.76-1.98]) were also significantly associated with increased DKA risk.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings indicate a strong, independent association between SGLT2i use and an increased risk of DKA in individuals with T2DM, with an even greater risk observed following recent COVID-19 infection. Additionally, underweight status, heart failure, and antip- sychotic medication use emerged as key risk factors. These insights highlight the need for cautious prescribing, particularly in high-risk groups or during infections, along with vigilant monitoring, patient education, and proactive sick-day management strategies to optimise safety and outcomes in the growing population using SGLT2i therapy.

**Background and aims:**
The effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotrans- porter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) versus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on the risk of diabetic foot disease is uncertain. Among persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) receiving routine clini- cal care, we aimed to compare the 6-year risk of foot disease in new SGLT2i users with that in new GLP-1RA users.

**Materials and methods:**
We used high-quality population-based Dan- ish health registers to conduct a cohort study emulating a target trial. We included all persons treated for T2D who initiated an SGLT2i or GLP-1RA drug during the study period (January 1, 2013 - December 31, 2022). We used validated hospital diagnosis codes to assess a pri- mary composite outcome of incident foot disease, including periph- eral artery disease, peripheral neuropathy, foot ulcers, and lower-limb amputations. Secondary endpoints included each foot disease outcome individually and all-cause death. We performed intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses considering treatment adherence, and calculated inverse probability of treatment-weighted risk differences (RDs) and risk ratios (RRs), adjusting for 40 potential confounders.

**Results:**
The study cohort included 62,500 SGLT2i users and 39,736 GLP-1RA users (median age 62 years, 60% male, diabetes duration 7 years). During 6 years, the weighted risk of foot disease was 10.8% in SGLT2i users and 12.4% in GLP-1RA users, corresponding to an RD of –1.5% (95% CI, –2.4% to –0.7%) and an RR of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.94) in intention-to-treat analyses. The difference was smaller in per-protocol analyses (RD, –0.6% [95% CI, –1.7% to –0.5%]; RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.05]). The slightly reduced risk of foot disease with SGLT2is occurred primarily after >3 years of follow-up in associa- tion with less peripheral neuropathy (RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.87]) and less peripheral artery disease (RR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.97]). SGLT2i and GLP-1RA users had similar risks of foot ulcers (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.06]) and amputations (RR, 0.98 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.05]). All-cause mortality was also similar for SGLT2i and GLP-1RA users (RR, 0.98 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.05]). A bias analysis suggested residual confounding from more severe obesity among GLP-1RA users.

**Conclusion:**
In this nationwide population-based cohort study of persons with T2D, SGLT2i and GLP-1RA initiators had a compa- rable risk of foot disease and all-cause mortality. Absolute risk dif- ferences were small and may be explained by non-adherence and residual confounding. SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs appear to be safe in regard to foot disease.

**Background and aims:**
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder affecting multiple systems in the body as hypothalamic dysfunction, which leads to hyperphagia, severe obesity, intellectual disability, hormonal imbalances, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The diabetes observed in PWS is atypical—it comes early in life, and often requires treatment intensification with insulin therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in this specific population, their use in patients with PWS, has not been extensively studied.

**Materials and methods:**
This is a retrospective, observational, real- world, nationwide multicenter study conducted by the PRADORT Reference Center in France. The study included 48 adults with both PWS and T2D, who were followed between 2022 and 2024. Data were collected before SGLT2 initiation and at 6 to 12 months after treatment in the routine care for “T SGLT2i” group and at 2 periods, 6 to 12 months apart, for the “Control” group. The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of SGLT2i in improving gly- cemic control. Secondary objectives were to evaluate their efficacy in renal protection, weight management, tolerance and safety. Data are presented as mean (SD), or median (IQR), statistical analysis performed by Mann and Witney or 2-way ANOVA or Chi square.

**Results:**
At baseline, both groups had comparable age (32.5 (9.4) vs 28.8(7.6) years-old), body mass index (42.1(7.4) vs 41.2(10) kg/ m2), duration of diabetes (10.5(7.7) vs 9.6(8.3) years) and number of diabetes treatment (2.4(1.1) vs 1.8 (1.4)), but different glycemic control (HbA1c of 9.1(2.0)% vs 7.2(1.3)%, p<0.05) respectively in T SGLT2i vs CTL. After SGLT2i initiation, a significant reduction in HbA1c (7.6(1.6)%, p<0.05 vs baseline) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (median of 5.0(IQR 2-13) vs 25.7 (2-60) mg/mmol at baseline, p<0.05) were observed in T SGLT2i group whereas it remained sta- ble in CTL group. At follow up, BMI was unchanged in both groups although, proportion of GLP 1 AR treatment was significantly higher in CTL group, and SGLT2i was initiate (without any other treatment modification) in T SGLT2i group. Adverse effects of SGLT2i were reported in 7 patients (29%), including 2 (8%) severe cases of acute kidney injury that required medical intervention. Other minor side effects, including dehydration and mucocutaneous issues, have been reported.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights that SGLT2 inhibitors are effective in improving glycemic control and show potential benefits in renal pro- tection for adult patients with PWS and T2D. However, the lack of sig- nificant changes in weight or BMI may reflect specific characteristics of PWS patients, such as persistent hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure. Furthermore, the relatively high incidence of adverse effects, including severe cases of acute kidney injury, underscores the need for cautious use of SGLT2 inhibitors in this population with a close monitoring especially at the start to mitigate the risks.

**Background and aims:**
Medication adherence is crucial for achieving therapeutic outcomes, yet approximately 25% of patients fail to take their prescribed medications. This non-adherence burdens healthcare systems and worsens health outcomes. The true adherence to specific drugs and the underlying reasons for non-adherence remain unclear. This is due to the complexity of adherence assessments, as question- naires are unreliable and provide limited information, while direct methods based on drug detection in blood are rarely used. Here we evaluated medication adherence in Czech patients with type 2 diabe- tes (T2D) using a direct method and to assess the clinical impact of non-adherence.

**Materials and methods:**
In this cross-sectional study, 641 Czech T2D patients attending routine outpatient visits were enrolled. After over- night fasting, blood samples were collected and analyzed using LC-MS to quantify plasma concentrations of 13 oral antidiabetic drugs, repre- senting both first- and second-line treatments. Adherence was defined as the detection of a prescribed drug above the detection limit. In addi- tion, patients completed a questionnaire assessing lifestyle factors and medication-taking habits.

**Results:**
Adherence to metformin was very high, with the drug unde- tected in only 2.4% of patients. In contrast, adherence rates were lower for other medications—94% for sulfonylurea analogs, 90% for DPP-4 inhibitors, and 82% for pioglitazone—with the lowest rates observed for SGLT2 inhibitors (73%) and repaglinide (fewer than 50%). Impor- tantly, non-adherence in our cohort was predominantly partial, with 93% of non-adherent patients selectively omitting only one of their pre- scribed drugs. Furthermore, adherence declined as the number of pre- scribed antidiabetic agents and daily doses increased, suggesting that treatment complexity plays a pivotal role in medication omission. None of the other tested lifestyle or drug management parameters signifi- cantly influenced adherence. Glycemic control was suboptimal among non-adherent patients, with 63% failing to achieve target glucose and HbA1c levels, compared to only 37% of fully adherent patients. Non- adherence was also associated with a higher prevalence of diabetic neuropathy and diabetic kidney disease.

**Conclusion:**
Partial non-adherence is common in T2D and is closely linked to treatment complexity and poor glycemic outcomes. These findings highlight the need for patient-specific strategies to improve adherence and optimize long-term diabetes management.

3. linikum Baden, Baden, Austria, Melk General Hospital, Melk, Austria.

**Background and aims:**
Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) accumulate in diabetic patients, contributing to tissue injury, inflam- mation, and long-term complications. Given that sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) have demonstrated car- diovascular benefits, this pilot study aimed to assess whether SGLT2 inhibitors reduce AGEs accumulation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included 70 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 18-70 years from the Lower Austria region. After apply- ing selection criteria, 35 patients were treated with SGLT2 inhibitors alongside other antidiabetic agents, while 31 patients did not receive SGLT2 inhibitors. AGEs accumulation was measured non-invasively using fluorescence-based AGE Reader (Diagnoptics®). Data were ana- lyzed using an unpaired t-test with GraphPad Prism 6, and results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
The study cohort consisted of 65% male patients, with a mean age of 64.82 years. The mean HbA1c level was 7.7% (60.66 mmol/ mol) in the SGLT2 inhibitor group and 8.1% (65.03 mmol/mol) in the non-SGLT2 inhibitor group. Patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors exhibited significantly lower AGEs accumulation (2.24 ± 0.42 arbi- trary units) compared to the non-SGLT2 inhibitor group (2.52 ± 0.36 arbitrary units), with a P-value of 0.005.

**Conclusion:**
This pilot study demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduce AGEs accumulation in diabetic patients, further supporting their cardiovascular benefits beyond glycemic control. However, larger and longer-term studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the long-term impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on AGEs reduction.

**Background and aims:**
The implementation of a clinical practice guideline for the integrated management of diabetes in the hospital setting, including therapies with benefits in terms of cardio-renal mor- bidity and mortality and their validation in real-world practice, will become a priority for any centre of excellence.

**Materials and methods:**
Prospective observational study in a third level centre to evaluate health care outcomes according to a new guide- line with a START-STOP protocol for the use of oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) (including oral semaglutide (oSEMA) and SGLT2 inhibitors). Sequential sampling of people with type 2 diabetes (PWT2D) admitted to hospital wards. Primary outcome variables-safety: serious adverse events (diabetic ketoacidosis, level 3 hypoglycaemia) or mild to moder- ate adverse events (level 2 hypoglycaemia, oral intolerance, hypoten- sion, decrease in eGFR > 30%, lactic acidosis). Secondary outcome variables - effectiveness: metabolic control (daily capillary blood glu- cose) and glycaemic variability (standard deviation).

**Results:**
441 PWT2D (median age 74 [65-81] years, 62.9% male), of whom 59.7% had CKM4a syndrome, were included. A total of 273 subjects (61.9%) received ADOs (without or with adjunctive insulin therapy (40.2%)) (group 1, [G1]) and 168 (38.1%) insulin monother- apy (group 2, [G2]). OADs used in G1 were: SGLT2 inhibitors (N 205), oSEMA (N 35), Metformin (N 56), DPP4 inhibitors (N 38). No significant differences in age, sex or frailty were found between the two groups. However, the proportion of patients in CKM4a (75.5% vs. 47.3%, p<0.001) and FIB4 score was significantly higher in G1. Eleven severe AEs were observed with predominance in G2 (OR 7.7 [95%CI 1.6 to 36.0]) (10 L3 hypoglycaemias, 2 in G1 and 8 in G2 and one diabetic ketoacidosis in G2). For mild or moderate AEs: 4 lactic acidosis in each group; 1 ketotic hyperglycaemia in G2; 9 L2 hypogly- caemias in G1 vs. 21 in G2 (OR 4.2 [95%CI 1.9 to 9.4]). There were no differences in all other AEs. Metabolic control was better in G1 (150 (IQR 128-182.5) vs. 179 (IQR 150.3-225.5) mg/dl, p<0.01), along with lower glycaemic variability (34.7 (IQR 21.0-52.7) vs. 54.3 (IQR 38.9- 73.9) mg/dl, p<0.01). Patients in G1 had a shorter hospitalisation time, one patient in each group required ICU assistance during hospitalisa- tion and 1.8% of G1 and 4.8% of G2 died. In the subpopulation with BMI≥27kg/m2, oSEMA in G1 was associated with better metabolic control (G1 153.5 (IQR 124.0-197.5) vs. G2 177.05 (IQR 153.0-223.0) mg/dl) and lower glycaemic variability (39.3 (IQR 20.5-59.9) vs. 48.9 (IQR 35.3-70.4) mg/dl) with no statistical significance.

**Conclusion:**
The use of oral antidiabetic agents within a START-STOP protocol in PWT2D is safe and effective in routine clinical practice and hospital settings, and was associated with better metabolic control and lower glycaemic variability than insulin monotherapy.

**Background and aims:**
There is limited real-world evidence on treatment patterns in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our primary aim was to describe anti-diabetic treatment patterns with a focus on sema- glutide, and the associated individual characteristics in Sweden and Denmark. An exploratory aim was to compare clinical outcomes between individuals using semaglutide and those using other anti- diabetic treatments.

**Materials and methods:**
Treatment-naïve individuals with T2D who initiated anti-diabetic treatment in 2010-2022 were identified using Swedish registries. Individuals were initially classified as receiving monotherapy or early dual therapy (a second drug added within 90 days). Subsequently, individuals on monotherapy could be reclas- sified into late dual therapy (a second drug added between 91 and 180 days) and triple therapy treatment groups (a total of three drugs within 180 days). Descriptive characteristics included demographics, prescription and comorbidity prevalence, laboratory and anthropo- metric values. Associations between treatment groups and clinical outcomes were studied using Cox regression.

**Results:**
We included 232,397 individuals (41.8% females) with T2D who initiated anti-diabetic treatment. Monotherapy was initi- ated in 215,272 and early dual therapy in 17,125 individuals. Of the individuals who initiated monotherapy, 39,402 continued with dual therapy and 17,498 with triple therapy. Among individuals receiv- ing monotherapy, 0.9% received a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), compared with 12.7% in early dual group and 17.3% in late dual group. Combinations including metformin were the predominant form of dual therapy. Prevalence of late dual therapy with metformin and GLP-1RAs increased from 11.3% in 2017-2018 to 29.6% in 2021-2022, with semaglutide becoming the most preva- lent GLP-1RA, surpassing liraglutide in 2019-2020. Cardiovascu- lar disease (CVD) was more prevalent in GLP-1RA monotherapy (41.8%) compared to metformin monotherapy (33.4%) or early dual therapy with GLP1-RA (30.6%). Mean BMI was 36.8 kg/m2 in both monotherapy with GLP-1RA and early dual therapy with GLP-1RA compared to 31.3 kg/m2 in metformin monotherapy. ­HbA was 69.7 mmol/mol (8.5%) in early dual initiation with GLP-1RA, 54.7 mmol/ mol (7.2%) in metformin monotherapy and 51.6 mmol/mol (6.9%) in GLP-1RA monotherapy. Outcome analyses and Danish data will be incorporated at EASD25.

**Conclusion:**
Semaglutide became the predominant GLP-1RA in recent years. Higher ­HbA , BMI and CVD prevalence were associated with earlier GLP-1RA initiation. A better understanding of how anti-diabetic treatment patterns relate to clinical profiles and outcomes can help to optimise treatment strategies on an individual level, thereby improv- ing outcomes.

**The Diabetes and Ramadan global survey: outcomes among people with type 2 diabetes using sulfonylureas vs non-insulin antidiabetic agents**

M. Hassanein

**Background and aims:**
There is an increased need to investigate fast- ing outcomes for Muslims with type 2 diabetes (T2D) that choose to fast during Ramadan. Numerous studies have demonstrated that sec- ond-generation sulfonylureas (SU) such as gliclazide and glimepiride are preferable to older drugs within this class. However, there is a notable lack of research directly investigating their use during fasting. This study seeks to understand the reported outcomes of patients that use ­2 generation SU during Ramadan.

**Materials and methods:**
The Diabetes and Ramadan global survey was conducted in fasting patients with T2D, in 2020 and 2022, in 14 countries. The survey was administered by healthcare practitioners post-Ramadan and compared patients that used second generation SU (gliclazide, glimepiride, gliclazide modified release [MR]) to those deemed to be a low-risk group (LRG) (who did not use SU). Patients on insulin-based therapies and those with any cardiovascular, renal comorbidities or foot complications were excluded. Fasting intentions and outcomes, and hypoglycaemia events were assessed.

**Results:**
The analysis included 5294 participants with mean age 51-55 years, mean duration of diabetes 6-8.4 years, HbA1c 7.45 -8.54, and with hypertension and hyperlipidemia as the most frequent complica- tions. Metformin and DPP4-inhibitors were the most frequently used concomitant medications. Participants taking SU intended to fast in similar proportions to those in the LRG. Those using gliclazide MR had the highest proportion reporting fasting the entire month of Rama- dan (77.4%) and took the shortest break from fasting during Ramadan (0.87 days) compared to all other groups. Hypoglycaemia results are presented in the Figure.

**Conclusion:**
In this global survey, T2D patients using modern SU were able to fast at the same frequency as non-SU users. Among ­2 genera- tion SU, the gliclazide MR group had the highest rates of fasting days and the lowest rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia.

3. Center, Dallas, TX, USA, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY,
4. USA, Perisphere, Austin, TX, USA.

**Background and aims:**
Randomized trials have demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide-1 based treatments (GLP-1s) lower blood glu- cose and lead to weight loss and cardiovascular benefits among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the real-world benefit of GLP-1s is likely limited if patients do not remain on therapy. We estimated GLP-1 adherence and persistence and describe reinitiation patterns among patients with T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from Optum’s Market Clarity database encompassing patient electronic medical records and insurance claims from January 2010 through June 2024. Patients aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of T2DM, at least one prescription fill for a GLP-1 (liraglutide, semaglutide, or tirzepatide) between 2010-2023, and health insurance coverage ≥3 months prior and ≥12 months after GLP-1 initiation were included. Adherence and persistence were assessed at 6 months and 12 months after GLP-1 initiation overall and by baseline BMI. Persistence was defined as continuous use of any GLP-1 without a gap of ≥60 days while adherence was defined as the proportion of days covered ≥80% at 6 and 12 months among those patients with at least two filled GLP-1 prescriptions. Reinitiation was defined as any GLP-1 prescription fill after a ≥60-day gap in therapy.

**Results:**
Among the 794,702 patients with T2DM initiating a GLP-1, adherence and persistence at 12 months were 52% and 42%, respec- tively (Table). Patients with higher baseline BMI showed greater adherence and persistence, with adherence rates ranging from 47% to 53% and persistence ranging from 35% to 43% across BMI categories. Overall, 58% of patients discontinued GLP-1 therapy within one year of initiation, with 72% of discontinuations occurring within the first 6 months of use. Of patients who discontinued GLP-1s by 12 months, 34% reinitiated treatment. GLP-1 reinitiation was more common among those who discontinued within the first 6 months than those who dis- continued between 6 and 12 months (24% vs. 10%, respectively), and among those with higher BMI at the time of treatment initiation (31% to 36% across BMI categories at 12 months).

**Conclusion:**
These findings confirm that real-world adherence and per- sistence to GLP-1s among patients with T2DM are lower than observed in clinical trials and highlight a complex patient journey characterized by frequent discontinuation and reinitiation. The established benefits of GLP-1s in trials have been established with long-term use, but in clini- cal practice, a large proportion of patients discontinue these medicines within the first year.

**Acute administration of exogenous glucose-dependent insulino- tropic polypeptide affects insulin secretion and sensitivity and cardiovascular function in type 2 diabetes**

C. Xie, itz, C. Rayner, T. Wu

**Background and aims:**
The incretin hormones, glucagon-like pep- tide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are important drivers of postprandial insulin secretion in healthy indi- viduals. GIP has received less attention as a potential therapeutic target because its insulinotropic effect is markedly reduced in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and poor chronic glycaemic control. Given the success of dual GLP-1/GIP agonists in the management of T2D, inter- est in GIP action has been renewed. This study evaluated the effect of intravenous GIP on glucose homeostasis and cardiovascular responses during a hyperglycaemic clamp in people with T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Ten participants with well-controlled T2D (4M, 6F; mean age 68.2±3.4 years, BMI 31.7±1.2 kg/m , HbA1c 6.9±0.6%) managed by diet and/or metformin monotherapy, were evaluated on 2 separate days in a double-blind, randomised, crossover fashion. On each study day, a hyperglycaemic clamp was maintained at 15 mmol/L between t=0-210 min by intravenous (IV) infusion of 25% dextrose. Concurrently, an IV infusion of GIP(1-42) (4 pmol/kg/ min, a supraphysiological dose) or placebo was administered. Venous blood was sampled frequently for measurements of blood glucose and plasma insulin. Insulin sensitivity was calculated as the mean IV glucose infusion rate divided by mean plasma insulin level between t=30-210 min. Automated measurements of blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at the ankle every 15 min from t=0-210 min. Data are means ± SEM.

**Results:**
All participants tolerated the protocol well and blood glucose was maintained at ~15 mmol/L on both days. Exogenous GIP infusion augmented plasma insulin levels by 183% (treatment effect: P=0.003, Figure A) and increased the amount of IV glucose required to main- tain hyperglycaemia by 26% (P=0.02), but reduced insulin sensitiv- ity by 40% (P<0.001, Figure B). GIP infusion was associated with an increase in heart rate (mean heart rate from t=30-210 min: GIP vs. placebo: 72.4±3.2 vs. 61.4±1.8/min, treatment effect: P<0.001) and reductions in both systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pres- sures (mean SBP from t=30-210 min, GIP vs. placebo: 167.4±6.3 vs. 181.3±7.2mmHg; mean DBP from t=30-210 min, GIP vs. placebo: 70.6±2.0 vs. 78.7±2.5mmHg treatment effect: P=0.01 each).

**Conclusion:**
In well-controlled T2D, exogenous GIP in a supraphysi- ological dose stimulates insulin secretion and increases whole-body glucose metabolism, albeit which impairing insulin sensitivity, and increases heart rate and reduces blood pressure during hyperglycaemia. These observations indicate that GIP remains biologically active, rather than inert in T2D, with the potential for profound long-term impacts on glucose metabolism and cardiovascular regulation.

**Background and aims:**
Metformin is one of the most common oral medications for type 2 diabetes (T2D) worldwide. Metformin treatment is associated with occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, which limit patient adherence to the treatment. Previously, female sex, age ≤ 65 years and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² have been associated with GI adverse events. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that higher levels of HbA1c at baseline are associated with GI adverse events. The number of studies on the topic are limited, and thus our aim was to assess the association between phenotype and GI adverse events in people with newly diagnosed T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
The study was a prospective cohort study, called the MEtformin adverse events mediated by gut MicrobiOta (MEMO)-study. The study was performed in four Swedish regions: Västerbotten, Östergötland, Örebro, and Västra Götaland. Participants with newly diagnosed (<1 year) T2D and without medication were included and completed three visits in four months: a baseline visit (Table 1) before metformin treatment was initiated, and two visits after two and four months of metformin treatment. At each visit, data on phenotypic characteristics and metabolic biomarkers were collected. GI symptoms (diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, bloating and loss of appetite) were assessed by questionnaire, and cases were defined as progression in GI symptoms compared to baseline. Statistical analysis was conducted using generalized linear regression modelling.

**Results:**
We included 168 participants, 54% were male, the mean age was 63.3 years (SD ± 9.0), and the mean BMI was 32.0 kg/m² (SD ± 5.0). Sixty-one participants (36%) developed GI side effects symptoms (cases) and 64% did not (controls) (Table 1). There was no association between age, sex, BMI and GI adverse events. Further- more, we observed no association between baseline HbA1c, c-peptide or cholesterol and the development of GI adverse events. However, fasting plasma glucose levels measured prior to metformin treatment initiation were inversely associated with development of GI side effects (OR 0.89, p=0.041).

**Conclusion:**
Our study did not corroborate previously reported asso- ciation between phenotype and gastro-intestinal adverse events of met- formin in newly diagnosed people with T2D.

3. Graz, Graz, Austria, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

**Background and aims:**
Incretin-based therapies have been shown to significantly reduce body weight and offer additional health benefits. These therapies have been reported to improve appetite control, reduce cravings for salty foods, and enhance overall craving regulation. How- ever, studies investigating their effects on taste perception have yielded conflicting results. We examined associations between self-reported changes in taste perception and appetite-related outcomes (satiety, appetite, and food cravings) in individuals with overweight (with ≥1 comorbidity) or obesity treated with GLP-1 RAs or dual GIP/GLP-1 RAs in a real-world setting.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 411 adults with overweight or obe- sity, 35% of whom had type 2 diabetes, participated in the study. Indi- viduals were grouped according to the type of incretin-based therapy: 217 received semaglutide (Wegovy, Novo Nordisk, Denmark; baseline median [IQR] BMI 35.9 kg/m² [33.3; 38.2]), 148 semaglutide (Ozem- pic, Novo Nordisk, Denmark; BMI 34.7 kg/m² [33.5; 36.5]) and 46 tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Eli Lilly, USA; BMI 36.2 kg/m² [34.3; 37.1]) (p=0.216 for BMI). Participants completed an online survey assess- ing sociodemographic, anthropometric, and sensory changes, along with appetite-related outcomes. Differences in body weight reduc- tion between groups were analysed using linear regression analyses (p<0.05). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess asso- ciations between taste perception changes and satiety, appetite, and food cravings.

**Results:**
The median [IQR] treatment duration was 10.0 months [6.8; 14.0] for Wegovy, 10.8 months [8.1; 15.0] for Ozempic and 11.8 months [8.8; 15.0] for Mounjaro, with no significant differences between groups (p=0.122). Linear regression analyses showed compa- rable weight loss rates: 0.95 kg/month (95% CI: 0.81-1.08) for Wegovy, 1.02 kg/month (95% CI: 0.86-1.18) for Ozempic, and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.75-1.33) kg/month for Mounjaro, with no statistically significant differences in slope estimates (p>0.05). Reduced appetite was reported by 58.4% of participants (Wegovy: 54.4%, Ozempic: 62.1%, Moun- jaro: 56.5%; p=0.220) and increased satiety by 63.5% (Wegovy: 66.8%, Ozempic: 58.8%, Mounjaro: 63.1%; p=0.346). Increased sweet taste perception was reported by 20.4% of participants (Wegovy: 19.4%, Ozempic: 21.6%, Mounjaro: 21.7%; p=0.489). Increased salty taste perception was reported by 21.7% of participants (Wegovy: 26.7%, Ozempic: 16.2%, Mounjaro: 15.2%; p=0.119). Independent of the type of therapy, increased sweet taste perception was significantly associated with increased satiety (AOR=2.04; 95% CI: 1.15-4.55), decreased appetite (AOR=1.67; 95% CI: 1.04-3.25) and decreased craving (AOR=1.87; 95% CI: 1.07-3.28). Increased salty taste per- ception was associated with increased satiety (AOR=2.16; 95% CI: 1.16-5.17; all p<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
In addition to the similar rates of body weight reduc- tion observed among the incretin-based therapy groups, self-reported changes in taste perception were also comparable across groups. These changes during incretin-based therapy were associated with favourable appetite-related outcomes, suggesting a potential mechanism contribut- ing to treatment response.

**Pharmacodynamic effects of oral small molecule GLP-1 agonist TERN-601 in healthy participants with obesity or overweight**

C. Nelson

**Background and aims:**
TERN-601 is a novel once-daily, oral, small molecule, GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) in development for chronic weight management. In the first-in-human (FIH) study, TERN- 601 was well-tolerated with no treatment-related dose interruptions, reductions, or discontinuations and showed dose-dependent, con- tinuous mean weight loss (up to -5.5% from baseline) over 28 days. Exploratory pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments included patient- reported appetite scores, a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), and gastric emptying (GE).

**Materials and methods:**
Participants in 3 cohorts (N=12/cohort) with BMI ≥27 to <40 kg/m were randomized 3:1 to receive TERN-601 or placebo (PBO) once-daily (QD) for 28 days. TERN-601 was titrated within 2 weeks from 100 mg to target doses of 240, 500, or 740 mg. At baseline, Day 13, and Day 27, four visual analogue scales were used to assess hunger, appetite, fullness, and satiety. Response to a mixed meal (Ensure Plus) was assessed at baseline and Day 27, with post-meal blood samples (MMTT) taken over 5 hours. GE was also evaluated at baseline and Day 27 by administration of oral acetami- nophen (APAP) as part of the MMTT and measurement of post-meal plasma APAP levels.

**Results:**
TERN-601 treatment resulted in dose-dependent least squares mean (LSM) area under the curve 0-4 hours (AUC​ , h.mm) decreases from baseline to Day 27 in hunger and appetite and increases in full- ness and satiety (Figure). LSM (SE) changes from baseline in MMTT glucose (AUC​ , h.mg/dL) were -44.40 (8.72) for the TERN-601 240 mg group (P <0.0001 vs. PBO), -45.95 (8.69) for the TERN-601 500 mg group (P <0.0001 vs. PBO), and -28.46 (8.63) for the TERN- 601 740 mg group (P <0.0001 vs PBO), compared to an increase of 26.84 (8.62) in the PBO group. Similar effects were observed for other MMTT analytes, including insulin and C-peptide. TERN-601-treated participants showed lower plasma APAP levels (AUC​ , h.μg/mL) on Day 27 compared to baseline, indicating reduced GE but without a dose response. This effect was not observed in participants treated with PBO.

**Conclusion:**
This study showed that all doses of TERN-601 were pharmacologically active based on PD markers GLP-1R mechanism of action, which included reduced appetite scores, lower post-prandial glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels, and slower gastric emptying. Together, these findings support the further clinical development of TERN-601 at doses of 240 mg QD and above for chronic weight management.

**pH-responsive porous pollen hydrogel for oral tirzepatide delivery to improve glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity**

Y. Liu

**Background and aims:**
Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor ago- nist, has demonstrated strong therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, its clinical application is limited by the requirement for subcutaneous injection, owing to poor oral bioavaila- bility resulting from enzymatic degradation and gastrointestinal epithe- lial barriers. Natural pollen grains possess unique surface architectures and excellent biocompatibility. They form a hollow and porous struc- ture, making them promising candidates for drug delivery vehicles after chemical treatment. This study aimed to develop a pH-responsive oral delivery system by loading tirzepatide into chemically treated porous pollen particles, followed by encapsulation with an alginate hydrogel shell to protect the tirzepatide in the gastric environment and achieve pH-responsive drug release in the intestine.

**Materials and methods:**
Tirzepatide was loaded into chemically treated porous sunflower pollen particles and encapsulated with algi- nate hydrogel to form a pH-responsive oral delivery system. Drug loading efficiency was quantified by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and distribution was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. In vitro stabil- ity was assessed under simulated gastric and intestinal pH conditions. In vivo retention was monitored using small animal imaging after oral administration of fluorescently labeled particles. Diabetic mice were orally treated with the formulation, and blood glucose, body weight, GTT, and serum insulin levels were measured to evaluate hypoglyce- mic efficacy and systemic absorption.

**Results:**
Tirzepatide was successfully encapsulated into porous pollen particles. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed uniform drug distribu- tion, and the system exhibited pH-responsive release behavior. It effec- tively protected tirzepatide from degradation under harsh gastric condi- tions and enabled sustained insulin release in response to the intestinal environment, thereby enhancing its oral bioavailability. In vivo imaging revealed that the PG@TZP@ALG group showed prolonged retention in the gastrointestinal tract compared to free tirzepatide. Oral administra- tion of PG@TZP@ALG led to significantly greater and more sustained reductions in blood glucose levels, along with elevated serum insulin, indicating improved therapeutic efficacy. Histological analysis con- firmed no observable intestinal damage, demonstrating the safety of the delivery system.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates that the pollen-based pH-respon- sive hydrogel system is a promising oral delivery platform for tirzepa- tide. It effectively protects the peptide from gastric degradation, pro- longs gastrointestinal retention, and enhances bioavailability, resulting in improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity without inducing intestinal damage. This strategy offers a non-invasive and biocompat- ible alternative for peptide-based diabetes therapy.

**The response of MiR-151b, MiR-RNA-29c-3p and MiR-4284 on submaximal doses of semaglutide in patients with obesity**

M. Samos, Sarlinova, M.J. Pec, I. Baranova, E. Halasova, M. Mokan

**Background and aims:**
MicroRNAs (MiRs) have been extensively studied as novel biomarkers of disease progression and/or of therapeutic response on different drugs. Obesity is crucial health-care problem, for which several novel drugs have been designed. This includes the long- acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) semaglu- tide. Previously, MiR-151b has been associated with regulation of fat tissue metabolism, MiR-29c-3p with diabetic complications, and MiR- 4284 with progression of atherosclerotic peripheral disease. However, the role of these MiRs in the predicting of treatment response to GLP-1 RA has not been studied. We aimed to evaluate the impact of obesity treatment with long-acting GLP-1RA semaglutide administered in sub- maximal doses on levels of MiR-151b, MiR-29c-3p and MiR-4284.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a prospective, post-marketing, observational study. The study enrolled 31 patients (22 women, mean age 48 years) with obesity (baseline mean body weight 115.9±22.3 kg, BMI 39.7±6.1 kg/m2). All patients were treated with semaglutide at an initial dose of 0.25 mg s.c. weekly, which was monthly up-titrated over 6 months only if not effective (doses of semaglutide ranged 0.25- 1.5 mg s.c. weekly). MiR levels were assessed at baseline, and after 6 months of semaglutide therapy.

**Results:**
After therapy, there was a significant weight reduction of 9.5% (mean after-treatment body weight 104.9±22.2 kg, BMI 36.1±6.4 kg/m2). Looking on the MiR levels after 6 months of therapy, there was a significant 2.18-fold increase in levels of MiR-151b (p<0.05), significant 2.2-fold increase in levels of MiR-29c-3p (p<0.05) and a significant 2.59-fold increase in levels of MiR-4284 (p<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
The study demonstrated significant increase in MiR151b, MiR-29c-3p and MiR-4284 after 6-months of sub-maximally dosed semaglutide therapy. These results advocate further research on the role of MiRs for predicting the treatment response on GLP-1RA in patients with obesity.

2. College London, London, UK, MRC Laboratory of Medical Sciences,

**Background and aims:**
Dual incretin-based therapies targeting both GLP-1R and GIPR are associated with increased metabolic benefits and weight loss, with recent studies demonstrating both GIPR expres- sion and functional responses in adipocytes. However, the mechanisms by which GIPR agonism regulates adipocyte function are currently incompletely understood. Recent reports have shown that long-acting GIPR agonists lead to increased lipolysis under fasted conditions in human and mouse adipocytes, with GIPR overexpression linked to increased adipocyte energy expenditure in mice via the induction of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ­Ca2 -ATPase (SERCA) pump-mediated futile calcium cycling. In this study, we aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which GIPR agonism controls SERCA pump activity to regulate adipocyte function.

**Materials and methods:**
Co-immunoprecipitation followed by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was per- formed to identify GIPR protein-protein interactions (PPI) enriched in GIP-stimulated vehicle conditions. 2D adipocyte cultures were differentiated from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) from healthy obese patients for functional studies of GIP effects. Calcium dynamics at ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites were assessed by the splitFAST-based ER-PRINCESS biosensor. Lipolysis was measured by glycerol release assay following 90 minutes of vehi- cle GIP stimulation in the presence of the acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor triacsin C. Oxygen consumption rates with and without eto- moxir were determined by Seahorse assay to assess levels of fatty acid oxidation under vehicle GIP-stimulated conditions.

**Results:**
LC-MS/MS interactome analysis of PPIs following GIPR immunoprecipitation led to the identification of a direct physical inter- action between active GIPR and SERCA2 following 10-15 minutes of GIP stimulation (Figure 1). GIP exposure also led to transient calcium rises specifically localised to ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites. Lipolysis was increased 1.73-fold after 90 minutes of GIP exposure in ADSCs from obese patients, with no increase observed in ADSCs from healthy patients in response to GIP (Figure 2). Disruption of ER- mitochondria calcium homeostasis with the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin and the VDAC channel activator erastin led to reduced lipolysis (1.22-fold) in GIP-treated ADSCs from obese patients, associ- ated with reduced rates of mitochondrial FAO.

**Conclusion:**
Our results indicate a role for the direct PPI between active GIPR and SERCA2 in ER-mitochondria calcium homeostasis in adipocytes, with subsequent effects in the control of GIP-induced lipolysis specifically in ADSCs from obese patients.

**Glucolipotoxicity affects the beta cell functional network by reducing leader and hub cell function: effects GLP1 receptor agonism**

G. Ostinelli

**Background and aims:**
Beta cells are a heterogenous population, particularly in terms of function. Functional heterogeneity is required to ensure normal glucose-stimulated insulin release. Over the past decade, our group and others have identified several functionally- distinct beta cell types, including “first responders” (i.e. the first cells to respond to increased glucose), “leaders” (which initiate pulsatile insulin secretion) and highly connected “hubs” (important for syn- chronized insulin secretion within the islet). How metabolic insults such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia or the combination of the two, affect the functional landscape and the properties of hubs and leaders is still unexplored. Therefore, our objective was to investigate how connectivity is altered under conditions which mimic type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We used male Ins-Cre:GCaMP6LoxP mouse islets (n=3 animals, 6 islets per condition), which express a genetically-encoded fluorescent Ca2+ reporter. This model allows for the assessment of beta cell responses based on intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. To mimic type 2 diabetes ex vivo, we used glucolipotox- icity (22 mM glucose, 0.5 mM palmitate or a combination of the two) for 72 h. Islets were then imaged using spinning disk confo- cal microscopy (Zeiss Axio-observer Z1). The ability of the islet to respond to a rise in glucose concentration (3 to 11mM) was fol- lowed. Subsequently, 1nM exendin-4 (GLP-1 analogue) was intro- duced. Ca2+ wave dynamics waves and connectivity analyses were performed in MATLAB, and statistics using R.

**Results:**
Beta cell synchronicity diminished under glucolipotoxic com- pared to control (p<0.01) and high glucose alone (p<0.05) conditions, and this was mirrored by the loss of a connected network. Average cell fluorescence during the second phase of insulin secretion was higher only under glucolipotoxicity compared to control or with high glucose or palmitate alone (p<0.01). Exendin-4 did not restore beta cell syn- chronicity or coactivity under glucopolipotoxicity, but these param- eters were improved by the drug when islets were treated with palmi- tate alone. The overall location of leaders or hubs was not affected by treatment, and in general leaders were found at the periphery of the islet while hubs were centrally located. The average synchronicity and coactivity of both leaders and hubs was diminished by glucolipotoxic- ity (p<0.05). These differences were not observed in first responders.

**Conclusion:**
Our results suggest that glucolipotoxicity selectively affects the creation of a functional network responsible for the generation and the spreading of pulsatile intracellular Ca2+ waves during the second phase of insulin secretion. In conclusion, changes observed here in beta cell connectivity might contribute to defective insulin secretion in T2DM and in some cases may be reversed by GLP-1 receptor agonism.

**Background and aims:**
In type 1 diabetes, the counterregulatory gluca- gon response to low plasma glucose is impaired. The resulting increased risk of hypoglycaemia necessitates novel strategies to ameliorate alpha cell impairment. Here, we aimed to establish an in vitro type 1 diabetes- like model of alpha cell impairment using standardised reaggregated human islet microtissues (MTs) exposed to proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, we investigated the therapeutic potential of incretin recep- tor agonists in improving alpha cell responses to low glucose.

**Materials and methods:**
Human islet MTs were exposed to proinflam- matory cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α) for 1 day (short-term) and 6 days (long-term). Alpha cell function was assessed by sequential glucose- dependent secretion assays at 2.8 and 16.7 mmol/l glucose, followed by glucagon measurements. Additional evaluations included ATP content, caspase-3/7 activity, chemokine secretion and content of islet transcrip- tion factors (aristaless-related homeobox [ARX] and NK6 homeobox 1 [NKX6.1]) and hormones. The effects of incretin receptor agonist treat- ment (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP] analogue [D-Ala ]-GIP with or without the glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1] receptor agonist liraglutide) alongside or after cytokine exposure were also investigated, focusing on low-glucose-dependent glucagon secretion.

**Results:**
Short-term cytokine exposure increased glucagon secretion at both 2.8 and 16.7 mmol/l glucose in islet MTs. In contrast, long-term cytokine exposure caused dose-dependent suppression of glucagon secretion at 2.8 mmol/l glucose, resembling a type 1 diabetes pheno- type. Long-term cytokine exposure also diminished insulin and soma- tostatin secretion, reduced ATP content, increased caspase 3/7 activity and decreased islet content of ARX, NKX6.1, glucagon and insulin. Despite cytokine-induced impairment, alpha cells partially retained secretory capacity to L-arginine stimulation. Treatment with incretin receptor agonists during long-term cytokine exposure did not prevent alpha cell impairment. However, acute treatment with [D-Ala ]-GIP with or without liraglutide, or with the single-molecule dual incretin receptor agonist tirzepatide, after cytokine exposure partially restored glucagon secretion at low glucose.

**Conclusion:**
Long-term cytokine exposure of human islet MTs created a type 1 diabetes-like phenotype with impaired low-glucose-induced glucagon secretion. This cytokine-induced alpha cell impairment was partially restored by [D-Ala ]-GIP with or without liraglutide, or by tirzepatide.

**Critical role of the area postrema for glucose-dependent insulino- tropic polypeptide receptor agonists in mice**

**Background and aims:**
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and dual GLP1R/glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide-recep- tor (GIPR) agonists are now established agents to treat diabetes and obesity, but the underlying physiology is insufficiently understood. In mice GIPR-activation reduces food intake through central mechanisms involving inhibitory GABAergic neurons, as Vgat2-dependent knock- out removes the effect. GIP also reduces the aversive effects of other anorexic signals, including GLP-1 and peptideYY (PYY), which has been linked to activation of GABAergic neurons in the area postrema (AP), a nucleus with a leaky blood brain barrier in the brain stem.

**Materials and methods:**
To selectively knock-down GIPR in the AP we injected homozygous floxed GIPR allele carrying mice with rAAV- Cre ­(GIPR mice) in the AP; rAAV-GFP injected mice or wt-GIPR allele carrying mice ­(GIPR mice) served as controls. Food intake in response to peripheral acyl-GIP administration was assessed. Flavour preference after conditioning with different aversive stimuli (e.g. PYY) in the presence or absence of acylGIP was assessed. GIP-Cre x Rosa26- Dq ­(GIP ) mice were used to stimulate intestinal GIP -secretion by application of the Dq-agonist CNO.

**Results:**
Peripheral acyl-GIP administration reduced food intake in lean chow fed ­GIPR , but not ­GIPR mice. Peripheral PYY admin- istration caused avoidance of a paired flavour, which could be prevented by either co-activation of intestinal GIP secretion in ­GIP mice or co- administration of acyl-GIP in ­GIPR mice. By contrast, co-adminis- tration of acyl-GIP failed to counteract PYY induced flavour avoidance in ­GIPR mice. Whilst ­GIPR mice gained considerable weight when switched to a high fat diet, ­GIPR mice were protected from diet induced obesity.

**Conclusion:**
Our data imply that GIPR expression in the area postrema is crucial for the suppression of food intake and anti-avoidance effects, considered to be a murine proxi-read out for similar antiemetic proper- ties in vomiting species, by GIPR-agonists in mice. The role, if any, of other GIPR expressing populations, for example in the hypothalamus, awaits further investigation.

**Background and aims:**
Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes remission. The current challenge is to identify pharmacological treatments that mimic the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery but avoid post-surgical complications. Therapies that can be combined with incretin receptor agonists to target comple- mentary pathways regulating energy balance are potential strategies for enhancing weight loss. These can allow dose reductions of each drug to thereby mitigate associated gastrointestinal side-effects of the current monotherapies. We have evaluated the combinatorial effect of cagrilintide and tirzepatide on weight loss in obese rats.

**Materials and methods:**
Diet-induced obese (DIO) Sprague Dawley male rats were dosed subcutaneously once-daily for 12 days with sub- maximal doses (3 and 10 nmol/kg) of cagrilintide and tirzepatide alone or in combination. Body weight and food intake were measured daily. Biochemical parameters in plasma were analyzed.

**Results:**
Relative to the vehicle controls, cagrilintide adminis- tered alone displayed superior efficacy in body weight reduction (-3.3%±1.8% at 3 nmol/kg and -5.7% ± 0.5% at 10 nmol/kg) com- pared with tirzepatide (+1.4% ± 0.4% at 3 nmol/kg and -1.9 ± 0.7% at 10 nmol/kg) at the end of the treatment period. The combination of both peptides at 3 nmol/kg each reduced body weight by -7.1 ± 0.7% (p<0.05 vs cagrilintide and p<0.001 versus tirzepatide). Reductions in cumulative food intake correlated with weight loss. The combinatorial treatment was more effective in decreasing plasma glucose compared to cagrilintide (p<0.001) and tirzepatide (p<0.05), ALT vs cagrilintide (p<0.001) and tirzepatide (p<0.05) and plasma TGs vs tirzepatide (p< 0.001). Further, the combinatorial therapy was superior in reducing hepatic TG (p<0.001) and improved liver histology.

**Conclusion:**
Combination therapy at sub-maximal doses of cagrilin- tide and tirzepatide elicited significantly greater weight loss, higher reduction in food intake and improved metabolic profile compared to monotherapy, suggesting the potential opportunity of this combination for further clinical development.

**Background and aims:**
Survodutide (BI 456906) is a novel potent glucagon receptor (GCGR)/GLP-1 receptor (GLP1R) dual agonist with robust anti-obesity efficacy due to effects on increasing energy expenditure and reducing food intake. The effects of survodutide on tissue remodeling, lipidome, and glucose homeostasis remain elusive.

**Materials and methods:**
3 groups of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57BL/6 mice were used: HFD controls, survodutide (survo, 10nmol/kg/day, s.c., q.d.), and pair-feeding (PF) controls that match survo food intake. We performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps at 3 weeks; liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) RNA-Seq at 1 week; liver, WAT, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) histology and liver, WAT, and plasma lipidomics at 1 and 3 weeks.

**Results:**
Survodutide led to ~25%, whereas PF to ~15% reduction in body weight vs. HFD at 3 weeks. Weight loss was largely attributed to reduced fat mass and was more pronounced in the survo group. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, and cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in PF vs. HFD, but survo led to reduced levels vs. both HFD and PF. Survo led to ~3-fold (all data mean±SEM; HFD: 69.8±7.7, Survo: 231.0±17.7, p<0.0001) and PF to ~2-fold (155.4±12.9, p=0.0037) increase in glucose infusion rate, highlighting more pronounced effects on improved systemic insulin sensitivity in survo vs. PF (p=0.004). Insulin-stimulated hepatic glucose output was reduced in both survo (p=0.0002) and PF (p=0.02) vs. HFD. Previously, we showed that short-term (7 days) survo treatment increases WAT glucose uptake in a food-intake independent manner. Consistently, after 21 days of treatment, C-2-deoxyglucose uptake into epididymal (HFD: 0.8±0.1, Survo: 2.7±0.6, PF: 1.1±0.08 mg/kg/min, p=0.002 vs. HFD) and inguinal (HFD: 0.47±0.08, Survo: 2.22±0.5, PF: 0.6±0.06 mg/kg/min, p=0.0009 vs. HFD) WAT was further increased in survo vs. both HFD and PF. Skeletal muscle and BAT showed elevated glucose uptake in both survo (p=0.002 for BAT; p=0.001 for quadriceps) and PF (p=0.08 for BAT; p=0.1 for quadriceps) vs. HFD. This amelioration of systemic insulin resistance was preceded by improved transcriptomic changes in liver and WAT at 1 week. Genes downregulated in livers of survo vs. HFD were associated with lipid storage and collagen deposition, whereas genes upregulated in inguinal WAT of survo vs. HFD were linked to insulin receptor signaling. Histology revealed reduced hepato- cyte fat accumulation and smaller adipocyte size in both survo and PF vs. HFD, effects that were more pronounced in survo. Survo and PF showed shared but also distinct pronounced effects on liver and WAT lipidome, including TAG, PC, PE, and CE species.

**Conclusion:**
Survodutide shows superior effects on improving insulin resistance, compared to PF. Both survodutide and PF increase systemic insulin sensitivity via improvements in BAT, muscle, and liver insulin responses. However, only survodutide leads to enhanced WAT insulin sensitivity. These distinct survodutide effects on enhanced WAT glu- cose uptake are independent of GLP1R-mediated reduction in food intake and are accompanied by enhanced lipolysis and fatty acid oxi- dation, reduced adipocyte size, altered lipid species composition in liver and WAT, and early transcriptomic changes linked to improved insulin signaling.

**Background and aims:**
Teplizumab is the first therapeutic to dem- onstrate the ability to delay progression from stage 2 to stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D). In this extension of the TrialNet stage 2 teplizumab study (TN-10), we followed participants who received a course of tepli- zumab after developing stage 3 T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
TN-10 Extension was a multicenter, single- arm, open-label study of former TN-10 participants previously ran- domized to a 14-day course of teplizumab or placebo. Participants within 1 year of stage 3 T1D diagnosis received a 12-day course of teplizumab with up to 78 weeks of follow-up.

**Results:**
Six participants (aged 12-44 years) received teplizumab; 5 previously received teplizumab and 1 received placebo in TN-10. Five participants received all 12 doses; 1 received 11 doses. The mean time from stage 3 diagnosis to first teplizumab dose was 36.8 weeks. All par- ticipants had at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 5 had treatment-related TEAEs. Treatment-related TEAEs reported for ≥50% of participants were headache, nausea, and lymphopenia (n=3 for each). One participant had the treatment-related TEAE of cytokine release syndrome (Grade 1, mild and fully resolved). No TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation. One serious AE, completed suicide, was not considered related to treatment. No hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis events were reported. Six of 6 participants had anti-drug antibodies and 4/6 had neutralizing antibodies. Mean (SD) HbA1c (%), average daily insulin use (U/kg/day), and C-peptide ln(AUC+1) was 7.22 (1.91) (n=6), 0.34 (0.17) (n=4), and 0.685 (0.209) (n=6) at baseline (the last non-missing value prior to the start of study treatment in the TN-10 Extension); and 8.50 (3.79) (n=4), 0.54 (0.36) (n=4), and 0.549 (0.428) (n=4) at Day 546, respectively. One participant met insulin discontinuation criteria.

**Conclusion:**
Teplizumab was safe and well tolerated in participants with stage 3 T1D. No new safety signals emerged in participants who received 1 course of teplizumab in stage 2 T1D and then 1 in stage 3 T1D.

**Background and aims:**
rhGAD65 formulated in aluminium hydroxide (rhGAD65) has been shown to preserve C-peptide secretion and improve glycaemic control compared to placebo in individuals with recent-onset Stage 3 Type 1 diabetes with HLA DR3-DQ2. Estimating this preserva- tion in terms of delay of progression to specific clinically meaningful thresholds provides valuable and relatable data on treatment efficacy. A stimulated C-peptide level above 0.2nmol/L is traditionally recognized as important for avoiding long term complications, and a C-peptide level above 0.5nmol/L has been shown to enable substantially better glycaemic control.

**Materials and methods:**
This post-hoc meta-analysis included 241 individuals diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in the preceding 6 months enrolled in three randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing rhGAD65 versus placebo on top of standard of care insulin treatment. All subjects were positive for HLA DR3-DQ2, 115 (47.7%) were female, and median age was 13 years (range 10 to 24 years). Treatment allocation was 80, 69, and 92 to 3-4 injections of rhGAD65, 2 injections of rhGAD65 or matching placebo injections, respectively. Survival models were built to assess the time until MMTT-stimulated C-peptide AUC decline below thresholds. Only individuals with baseline C-peptide above threshold were included the respective analysis.

**Results:**
Kaplan-Meier plots for time-to-C-peptide-below-threshold (Fig- ure) indicate a dose-dependent benefit of rhGAD65 over placebo with a significant prolongation of the time above stimulated C-peptide >0.2 nmol/L (n=241, log-rank test p=.001; median survival time only reached for placebo at 14.6 months), and >0.5 nmol/L (n=163, p=0.015; median survival time 14.5, 11.5 and 8.8 months for 3-4 injections, 2 injections and placebo, respectively).

**Conclusion:**
These meta-analysis results suggest that rhGAD65 delays progression of stage 3 T1D with an absolute benefit for preserving func- tional beta cell reserve at a physiologically meaningful level. If confirmed in the ongoing Phase 3 trial DIAGNODE-3, these results support a dura- ble disease-modifying effect manifesting as a delay in C-peptide loss below critical levels.

4. tralia, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia, Royal Adelaide

**Background and aims:**
Metformin, the first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D), has pleiotropic actions to lower both fasting and post- prandial hyperglycaemia. Potential mechanisms leading to the latter include enhanced secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and slowing of intestinal glucose absorption. In a recent study, we dem- onstrated that metformin, administered 30 or 60 min before a small intestinal glucose load, reduced the glycaemic excursion more than when given concurrently with glucose (Figure 1A, data are means ± SEM, symbols denote P <0.05), associated with augmented GLP-1 secretion. We have now retrospectively analysed a marker of intestinal glucose absorption to gain further insights into the impact of varying the timing of metformin administration in relation to a meal.

**Materials and methods:**
16 participants with T2D managed by met- formin monotherapy (2 female, aged 69.9 +/- 1.9 years, BMI 28.7 +/- 1.0 kg/m , HbA1c 6.6 +/- 0.1% / 48.2 +/- 1.6 mmol/mol), were studied on 4 occasions in a double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover design. On each study day, participants received metformin (1g in 50mL 0.9% saline) via a nasoduodenal catheter at t = -60, -30 or 0 min or saline control, followed by an intraduodenal infusion of 45g glucose + 5g 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG, a non-metabolised glucose analogue which is a marker of glucose absorption) from t = 0 - 60 min. Serum 3-OMG concentrations were measured every 30 minutes from t = 60 to t = 120 min.

**Results:**
There was a significant treatment effect (P = 0.012) as well as a treatment by time interaction (P = 0.008) on serum 3-OMG con- centrations. Compared with control at t = 90 min, serum 3-OMG concentrations were less on metformin days, and at t =120 min when metformin was administered 30 min before the glucose infusion (P < 0.05 for all). However, there was no difference in serum 3-OMG concentration with pre-meal metformin administration relative to con- current administration with intraduodenal glucose (Figure 1B, data are means ± SEM, symbols denote P <0.05).

**Conclusion:**
The slowing of small intestinal glucose absorption by metformin is not modified by administration prior to, rather than with, an intestinal glucose load. Accordingly, changes in glucose absorption do not account for the enhanced glucose-lowering and GLP-1 stimula- tion associated with pre-meal administration of metformin.

**Background and aims:**
Imeglimin is a novel hypoglycemic agent that exerts multiple metabolic effects. However, the exact time course and underlying mechanisms by which imeglimin enhances systemic glucose metabolism remain unclear in humans. This study aimed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of imeglimin’s glucose-lowering effect by performing a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in combination with a double-tracer method.

**Materials and methods:**
We administered imeglimin for 20 weeks to 22 male patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56.2±7.4 years, BMI 24.7±3.1 kg/m², HbA1c 7.1±0.7%) who had been receiving either met- formin monotherapy or diet and exercise therapy alone. A 75-g OGTT was performed at baseline, 1 week after the initiation of imeglimin, and at 20 weeks, using two stable glucose isotopes (U-[¹³C]glucose and [6,6-²H ]glucose) to assess endogenous glucose production (EGP), the rate of appearance of orally administered glucose (RaOral), and the rate of glucose disappearance (Rd). The primary endpoint was the change in the 0-3 hour area under the glucose curve (AUC - h) from baseline to 20 weeks.

**Results:**
At 20 weeks, the AUC - h glucose decreased significantly by -91.7±90.4 mg·h/dL (p<0.001). Notably, this reduction was evi- dent at 1 week (-104.1±93.2 mg·h/dL, p<0.001). Regarding RaOral, a significant reduction was observed in AUC - h and AUC - h at 1 week, whereas at 20 weeks, it showed only a downward trend with- out reaching statistical significance. EGP did not differ significantly at any time point at either 1 or 20 weeks, although the AUC - h was significantly lower at 1 week only. As for Rd, there was a significant increase between 150 and 210 minutes at 1 and 20 weeks. Beginning at 1 week after initiating imeglimin therapy, the insulinogenic index and the AUC - insulin/glucose ratio increased significantly, whereas the Matsuda index showed no significant change. Elevations in GLP-1 and GIP levels accompanied these alterations.

**Conclusion:**
This study revealed three complementary mechanisms of action for imeglimin: (1) enhancement of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, (2) increased secretion of gut-derived incretin hor- mones, and (3) improved post-load glucose absorption and utiliza- tion dynamics. Notably, these effects emerged within the first week of treatment and persisted throughout the 20-week treatment period, suggesting that imeglimin is a novel antidiabetic agent with multifac- eted mechanisms of action.

4. Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia, The University of Adelaide,

**Background and aims:**
In a large animal model of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we have shown that portal, GLP-1-dependent, glucose sens- ing is impaired and a low-dose dihydrotestosterone (DHT) implant inserted into the area of the portal sensor normalizes glucose metab- olism acutely. We evaluated the capacity of portal DHT to achieve sustained remission of diabetes and its impact on cardiovascular and renal function.

**Materials and methods:**
Three groups of six Yucatan minipigs, aged three years, were used. Two groups were made diabetic (high-fat, high- sucrose diet plus small dose of streptozotocin 80 mg/kg IV). A silicon implant (20 mm long, 4 mm diameter) delivering 100μg/24H DHT (DHT) was inserted laparoscopically closed the low-density GLP-1r portal area in half of the animals, while the other half received an implant without DHT (Sham). The exact location of the low-density GLP-1r portal area was obtained by GLP-1r radio tracer PET imaging (68Ga-NODAGA-Exendin4) prior the laparoscopic insertion of the implant. The third group was fed a low-fat, low-sucrose diet and served as a control (Lean). One year after implant insertion, blood glucose was monitored by CGM over a week. Insulin sensitivity was obtained during a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. High-frequency oscil- lometry, ultrasound pulse wave velocity and gated 18FDG PET were used to evaluate cardiovascular health. Renal protection was inferred from glomerular filtration rate using 68Ga DOTA PET.

**Results:**
Data are presented in the table.

**Conclusion:**
In a large animal model of T2D, low-dose, portal DHT administration has sustained effects to improve both glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity, and preserves cardiovascular and renal function.

**Targeting CD36 with Nitro-Oleic Acid to protect pancreatic beta cell function: a hopeful drug candidate for anti-diabetic therapy**

S. Mandal

2. India, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany.

**Background and aims:**
Nitro-fatty acids are signaling mediators formed when unsaturated fatty acids react with nitric oxide or its deriv- atives. Among them, Nitro-Oleic Acid ­(NO OA) is the most studied, exhibiting anti-inflammatory properties and protective effects against hepatic steatosis. Endogenously, ­NO OA is found in human plasma and naturally sourced from olives and olive oil. We and others have established CD36, a long-chain fatty acid transporter, elevated in the islet of donors with obesity and T2D, responsible for FFA-FetuinA mediated islet inflammation and intracellular lipid accumulation in pancreatic beta cells, leading to beta cell dysfunction. However, suit- able pharmacological candidates targeting CD36 to protect beta cell function in obesity-associated T2D are not in practice. The present study thus aims to investigate ­NO OA, a CD36 ligand and promising drug candidate, for its potential to preserve beta cell function under hyperlipidemic conditions.

**Materials and methods:**
BODIPY or Nile Red staining was employed with confocal microscopy to visualize intracellular accumulation of lipid in MIN6 (Mouse Insulinoma), INS-1 (Rat Insulinoma) cell lines and primary mouse islets. To mimic hyperlipidemic conditions in vitro, Palmitate (0.75 mM) and FetuinA (100 ug/ml) were conjugated (PF) for treatment. Cells were pre-incubated with ­NO OA (2μM) for 1 h before PF treatment. Immunoblot and qPCR analysis of treated cells were performed to study the expression of CD36, TLR4, pNFkBp65, Pdx1, Ins1 and other inflammatory, lipid metabolic, ER stress, and beta cell functional markers. BODIPY FL C12 was used to assess fatty acid uptake. MitroTracker CMTMRos was used to label mitochondria, and marker of mitochondrial beta-oxidation (Cpt1) was studied. Beta cell function was assessed via Glucose Stimulated Insulin Secretion (GSIS). For in vivo validation, obese mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks received ­NO OA (@0.5mg/kg b.w., i.p.), and isolated islets were evaluated accordingly.

**Results:**
MIN6, INS-1, and primary islets incubated with PF for 48 h exhibited significant lipid accumulation, which was markedly reduced by ­NO OA pre-incubation. ­NO OA did not alter CD36 expression but modulated its function, as indicated by significantly reduced BODIPY FL C12 uptake, suggesting decreased fatty acid transport and lipid accumulation. Additionally, immunoblot and qPCR analysis showed downregulated TLR4 expression and pNFkBp65 activation, along with reduced IL-1β secretion in ­NO OA-treated cells, compared to PF treatment alone, indicating mitigation of inflammation. Also, ER stress markers GRP78 and CHOP were lowered by ­NO OA treatment. Confocal imaging showed improved mitochondrial activity and poten- tial, with elevated Cpt1 expression indicating increased beta-oxidation in ­NO OA compared to PF-treated cells. GSIS, Ins1 and Pdx1 gene expression levels were improved in ­NO OA treatment compared to PF, suggesting ­NO OA preserved beta cell secretory function. In vivo, ­NO OA significantly abrogated islet lipid accumulation in HFD-fed obese mice.

**Conclusion:**
­NO OA preserved pancreatic beta cell function by miti- gating inflammation and ER stress-mediated damage induced by FFA- FetuinA, reducing lipid accumulation, and enhancing mitochondrial function. These findings position ­NO OA as a potent drug candidate to protect against obesity-associated beta cell dysfunction.

**Efficacy of the novel UCN2 analogue HM17321 in weight loss with- out muscle wasting in obese non-human primates and its applica- tions with incretins in obese mice**

J. Kim

**Background and aims:**
In recent years, incretin-based drugs have achieved impressive results in obesity management, but the obvious limitations associated with accompanying lean mass reduction have also emerged. To overcome this limitation, HM17321, a corticotropin- releasing factor receptor 2 (CRFR2) selective and biased urocortin-2 (UCN2) agonist, is in development, and has demonstrated efficacy in fat-driven weight loss in several rodent studies. In the current studies, we aim to confirm the fat reducing efficacy without lean mass reduc- tion in middle-aged obese monkeys, focusing on its human relevance. In addition to its potential as monotherapy against obesity, diverse applicable strategies with incretin-based drugs were evaluated in rodent obesity models.

**Materials and methods:**
In a non-human primate study, 10-18 years old obese monkeys (Initial BMI: 49.3 kg/cm ) were subcutaneously injected with vehicle or HM17321 once weekly for 12 weeks. Body weight and fat/lean composition were evaluated every 4 weeks using DEXA scan. In rodent studies, high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice were subcutaneously injected with vehicle, HM17321 and incre- tins either alone or in various experimental schemes, such as switching, add on or withdrawal. Body composition was determined according to each study design using TD-NMR.

**Results:**
HM17321 significantly reduced body weight and fat mass in obese monkeys while preserving lean mass. During the first 4 weeks of treatment, body weight decreased by over 14% and fat mass by over 30% from baseline, whereas lean mass remained unchanged. In DIO mice, a 6-week combination treatment of HM17321 with incretins sig- nificantly reduced body weight compared to each incretin monotherapy, with a difference of 10.5 - 14.4%-points. The additional body weight reduction was solely attributed to fat mass reduction, with fat mass in the combination group reduced by -50.46% to -82.23% compared to baseline. Notably, during this potent fat mass reduction, lean mass was either preserved or increased, in contrast to the lean mass reduction observed with incretin monotherapy. Next, when HM17321 was added to incretins, it showed further decrease in body weight and fat mass, even after the efficacy of incretins had plateaued. By the end of the study, the addition of HM17321 resulted in a greater reduction in both parameters compared to each monotherapy, with differences of 12.8 - 19.8%-point and 23.9 - 49.2%-point, respectively. In contrast, switching from incretins resulted in either additional fat loss or maintenance of the fat reduction by incretins, while dramatically increasing lean mass (11.0 - 13.3 %-point increased from before switching).

**Conclusion:**
The fat reducing efficacy of HM17321 without muscle wasting was confirmed in non-human obese primates, highlighting its potential as a monotherapy for obesity treatment with human relevance. Along with its human relevance, applications for the best quality in weight loss through various dosing regimens were also confirmed. These findings suggest that HM17321 could be a promising therapeu- tic option for treating obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels resulting from impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, or both. Milk-derived extracellular vesicles (MDEs) contain beneficial microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with T2D, includ- ing miR-378a and miR-146b. These miRNAs are carried in the MDEs and resist digestion in simulated gastrointestinal conditions, enabling their absorption into systemic circulation and interaction with target cells and tissues. We hypothesize that MDEs, through their unique miRNA cargo, could offer a potential therapeutic approach for diabe- tes. To investigate the effects of MDEs and their miRNA cargo on glucose homeostasis and inflammation in the pancreas, liver and islets treated in vivo and in vitro with MDEs.

**Materials and methods:**
Studies were performed on Cohen diabetic- sensitive (CDs) rats, a model of nutritionally induced T2D. Diabetes was induced in CDs rats by feeding them a diabetogenic high-sucrose diet (HSD). MDEs were thoroughly characterized by qRT-PCR, West- ern blotting, electron microscopy and Nanosight. For in vivo stud- ies, CDs-HSD rats were divided into two groups: a treatment group receiving oral gavage of MDEs (25 mg/kg) three times per week, and a control group receiving PBS. Glucose homeostasis was assessed at the end of the study using oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), with blood glucose levels measured via glucometer and insulin concentra- tions determined by ELISA. Genes and miRNAs expression levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. For in vitro studies, pancreatic islets isolated from CDs-HSD rats were treated with MDEs, and subsequent analysis were performed to evaluate miRNA expression and target genes expression.

**Results:**
In vivo studies showed that MDEs administration significantly lowered blood glucose levels (p<0.01) and increased the insulin/glu- cose ratio (p<0.05) in MDEs-treated rats. Our study revealed a signifi- cant upregulation (p<0.05) in the expression of miR-146b, a negative regulator of inflammatory gene expression, in the pancreas, liver, islets and in islets isolated from CDs-HSD rats treated with MDEs. This upregulation was also observed in vitro in islets treated with MDEs (p<0.05). A corresponding significant decrease in the expression of the target gene TLR4 was noted in the pancreas and islets of MDEs-treated CDs-HSD rats (p<0.05), as well as in islets isolated from CDs-HSD rats treated in vitro with MDEs (p<0.005). The expression of miR- 378a, which regulates liver fibrosis and metabolism, was significantly elevated in the livers of MDEs-treated rats (p<0.05), along with a decrease in the expression of the target gene IL1RAP in the liver.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that MDEs have therapeutic poten- tial in regulating glucose homeostasis and inflammation in the CDs rat model. MDEs treatment significantly lowered blood glucose levels, improved insulin secretion, and altered miRNA expression, includ- ing the upregulation of miR-146b and miR-378a. Furthermore, the downregulation of TLR4 and IL1RAP expression points to a poten- tial anti-inflammatory mechanism. These results position MDEs as a promising intervention for metabolic and inflammatory dysfunctions in T2D, warranting further exploration of their clinical applications.

**Background and aims:**
The STRIDE trial demonstrated that once weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) semaglutide 1.0 mg improves functional capacity and symptoms in people with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Smoking is a well-documented risk factor for PAD, with previous or current smokers being up to 2.8 times more likely to have PAD than those who have never smoked. However, smok- ing cessation interventions often show limited effectiveness among people with PAD. Understanding the effect of smoking status in the STRIDE population can provide valuable insights for the outcomes in people with PAD and T2D. This post-hoc analysis aims to evalu- ate whether the benefits of semaglutide are consistent regardless of smoking status.

**Materials and methods:**
STRIDE was a 52 week, randomized, pla- cebo-controlled trial evaluating the effect of once weekly s.c. semaglu- tide 1.0 mg in people with PAD and T2D. The primary endpoint was the ratio to baseline in maximum walking distance (MWD) at week 52 on a constant load treadmill. Secondary confirmatory outcomes included the ratio to baseline in pain-free treadmill walking distance (PFWD) at week 52. This secondary analysis evaluates whether smok- ing status (never, previous, current) at baseline impacts the effect of semaglutide on functional outcomes in STRIDE participants. Smok- ing was defined as smoking at least one cigarette or equivalent daily and smoking status was assessed by the site staff. A mixed model for repeated measures analysis, with an interaction term between the treat- ment and relevant subgroups adjusted for baseline of the endpoint, was performed.

**Results:**
Within the STRIDE population, 203 (25.6%) people were cur- rent, 367 (46.4%) previous smokers and 222 (28%) had never smoked. Median MWD (IQR) at baseline was 162m (121m), 185m (132m) and 214m (140m) in current, previous and never smokers, respectively, corresponding median PFWD (IQR) distances at baseline were 102m (76m), 111m (86m) and 144m (118m). The estimated treatment ratios (ETR) for MWD change at week 52 to baseline for current smokers, previous smokers, and never smokers consistently demonstrated no significant interaction between smoking status and treatment effect (p-value of 0.746) (figure panel A). Similarly, analysis of PFWD change at week 52 to baseline demonstrated no significant interaction between smoking status and treatment effect (p-value of 0.632) (figure panel B).

**Conclusion:**
This analysis demonstrates that the consistent beneficial effect of semaglutide treatment on MWD and PFWD observed in the STRIDE trial do not significantly differ based on smoking status at baseline.

10. ham, Derby, UK, City Hospital, Birmingham, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Glucagon like peptide 1 agonists (GLP-1a) are increasingly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity due to its cardiometabolic benefits. Semaglutide is the only GLP-1a, available in both injectable and oral forms, the latter relying on advanced tech- nology to ensure optimal absorption and treatment efficacy. Across the PIONEER programme, oral semaglutide demonstrated similar efficacy for reduction of HbA1c and weight compared with injectable liraglu- tide. However, data on comparative efficacy and effectiveness between oral and injectable Semaglutide is not available. Understanding the real-world effectiveness is important for optimizing outcomes in type 2 diabetes. We thereforeundertook a real-world study to provide insight into the relative effectiveness of oral compared with injectable when used in our clinical practice.

**Materials and methods:**
Data was obtained from ABCD (Association of British Clinical Diabetologists) national audit. The data analysed using STATA 18. Linear regression analysis was used and key variables include age and baseline HbA1c.

**Results:**
There were 1484 people on injectable semaglutide (49.2% female, mean age 58.9+/-10.9 years) and 636 people on oral semaglu- tide (40.2% female, mean age 58.9+/-12.86 years). Both groups showed significant HbA1c reductions from baseline (table 1). The injectable group however experienced a greater reduction in HbA1c levels (mean difference between groups: -4.07mmol/mol, p value <0.01. The mean follow-up time was 413+/-342.3 days in oral group and 6 months in injectable group.

**Conclusion:**
Within the UK real-world setting, both oral and injectable semaglutide are effective to reduce HbA1c levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Compared with oral therapy, injectable semaglutide showed greater Hba1c reduction in these observational datasets. These findings support personalized treatment choices based on individual preferences and clinical need.

**Dulaglutide for management of type 2 diabetes in a patient with Bardet-Biedle syndrome: a case report**

W.N. Laimon

**Background and aims:**
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare, autosomal recessive, multisystem non-motile ciliopathy of progres- sive onset. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is prevalent among BBS patients, related to the severity of obesity. Dulaglutide is GLP1 receptor agonist which is FDA approved for the treatment of T2DM in children aged 10 years and older.

**Materials and methods:**
An 11-year-old Kuwaiti male, born to con- sanguineous parents, presented to the outpatient clinic for follow-up of diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity. He was born late preterm at 36 weeks of gestation via normal vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 2.44 kg. His medical history includes a dilated pelvicalyceal sys- tem, postaxial polydactyly of both hands and feet, micropenis, and cryptorchidism. He underwent bilateral orchiopexy for cryptorchid- ism and surgical removal of the extra digits. Since early childhood, he experienced poor vision that worsened at night and was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa and astigmatism. Additionally, he had a history of rapid weight gain and learning difficulties. At the age of 11 years, he developed polyuria and was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, with an initial HbA1c of 13.5%. He was started on a basal-bolus insulin regimen along with metformin. Sequencing within BBS9 gene target- ing c.223 C >T mutation was carried out using ABI3100, data were analyzed using BioEdit software.

**Results:**
Further investigations confirmed T2DM. Genetic testing iden- tified a homozygous BBS9 c.223 C>T mutation, confirming a diagno- sis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Weekly subcutaneous dulaglutide 1.5 mg was initiated, resulting in good glycemic control but no significant change in body mass index. Short-acting insulin was discontinued, and he is currently maintained on dulaglutide, insulin degludec, and met- formin. His most recent time in range was 96%, and his latest HbA1c was 5.7%.

**Conclusion:**
BBS is a rare, heterogeneous ciliopathy that affects mul- tiple organs and systems. Dulaglutide has proven effective in managing T2DM including cases secondary to monogenic obesity. To the best of our knowledge, this the first case which reports the use of dulaglutide in treatment of T2DM in BBS.

**Tirzepatide as a potential strategy to overcome leptin resistance in obesity**

R. Izumi, guchi, M. Sakai, K. Shibue, S. Honjo, N. Inagaki

**Background and aims:**
Leptin is a key hormone regulating food intake, but despite the increased circulating levels of leptin, its effect on food intake is diminished in obesity due to leptin-resistance, limit- ing its therapeutic potential. Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated superior weight-reducing effects compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists alone. However, the impact of tirzepatide on leptin sensitivity remains unclear. This study investigates whether tirzepatide enhances leptin responsiveness to provide a novel therapeu- tic strategy for obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
To induce leptin-resistance to wild type male Wistar rats, they were on a high-fat diet for 3 weeks. They were rand- omized into four groups: saline (SAL), tirzepatide alone (TIR), leptin alone (LEP), and tirzepatide plus leptin (TIR/LEP). Tirzepatide (10 nmol/kg) and leptin (500 μg/kg) were administered subcutaneously for four days. As a leptin deficient model, Zucker fatty rats were used. They were fed a standard diet and were administered saline or Tirze- patide (10 nmol/kg) subcutaneously for four days. Body weight and food intake were measured daily. Lipid profiles and lipoprotein lipase activity were analyzed. Liver triglyceride content and brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation were assessed via RT-PCR for UCP1 expres- sion. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was measured in post-heparin plasma samples.

**Results:**
Tirzepatide tend to reduce body weight gain compared to saline at day 5 (-0.9±1.5 g vs 4.5±21 g), and co-administration with leptin significantly enhanced this effect compared to tirzepatide alone (-0.9±1.5 g vs -7.4±1.2 g; p<0.05). Leptin alone had no significant impact. Food intake was also most reduced in the TIR/LEP group significantly (42.4±2.1 kcal/day vs 64.0±4.1 kcal/day in SAL group; p<0.01).TIR/LEP led to a significant reduction in fasting plasma TG compared to SAL (133.9±6.5 mg/dL vs 86.4±8.0 mg/dL; p<0.01), with notable decreases in chylomicron and VLDL fractions. Hepatic triglyceride accumulation showed a similar trend. LPL activity tend to be increased in TIR, LEP, and TIR/LEP groups compared with the SAL group, with no additional enhancement observed in the TIR/ LEP group. Zucker fatty rats lacking functional leptin receptors also exhibited significant reductions in body weight compared to saline (3.15±2.5 g vs 10.5±0.6 g; p<0.05) and food intake ( 81.0±3.2 kcal/ day vs 95±3.1 kcal/day; p<0.05) with tirzepatide, indicating additional leptin-independent mechanisms. UCP1 expression in BAT was simi- larly increased in TIR, LEP, and TIR/LEP groups, suggesting that tirze- patide and leptin independently activate BAT without additive effects.

**Conclusion:**
Co-administration of tirzepatide and leptin showed a greater reduction in body weight and food intake than either agent alone, even in leptin-resistant states, suggesting that tirzepatide could enhance leptin sensitivity. These findings suggest tirzepatide may ena- ble leptin-based obesity treatments. Additionally, its weight-lowering effects in Zucker fatty rats indicate leptin-independent mechanisms. This study provides a potential strategy to overcome leptin resistance, opening new possibilities for obesity therapies.

**Tirzepatide as an adjunctive therapy in type 1 diabetes: real-world experience from a large UK centre**

S.A. Berry, E. ­McNally, I. ­Goodman, J. ­Elliott, A. ­Iqbal

**Background and aims:**
Tirzepatide is increasingly used for the man- agement of type 2 diabetes and for weight reduction. Obesity is preva- lent in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), exacerbating insulin resist- ance, thereby augmenting cardiometabolic risk. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of tirzepatide when used in people with T1D and obesity. We hypothesised that tirzepatide would improve glycaemia, promote weight loss and reduce insulin requirements.

**Materials and methods:**
A longitudinal, retrospective study was conducted, including all people with T1D started on tirzepatide at a large tertiary centre. Case notes were reviewed for current dose, side effects, clinic weights, and hospital attendances. Glycaemic metrics were obtained from the respective CGM cloud applications. Where data were missing, paired data were excluded from analysis. Two-tailed paired t-tests were conducted to compare variables measured before and after six months of tirzepatide treatment. Data are presented as median (IQR) and mean (95%CI). Pearson’s rank test was used to ana- lyse for correlations.

**Results:**
Fifty-seven participants were identified (66.7% female). Prior to initiating tirzepatide, the median age was 39 years (26-52), weight 101.6 kg (92.5-123.8), body mass index 36.3 kg/m (33.2-40.6) and HbA1c 60 mmol/mol (52-67.) At 6 months, the dose of tirzepatide was 2.5mg once weekly in 9 participants (18%), 5mg in 37 (74%), 7.5mg in two, and there was one participant each on 10mg and 15mg. Mean weight significantly reduced by 9.8 kg (9.3%) after 6 months of tirzepatide use (7.7-11.9, p<0.001, n=42.) Mean total daily insu- lin dose decreased by 25.2% from 74.4 units to 57.3 units (8.2-26.1, p<0.001, n=27), with a mean reduction in total daily bolus dose of 11 units (4.5-17.5, p=0.002, n=26) and basal dose of 10.8 units (4.5-17.1, p=0.001, n=39). Mean HbA1c decreased by 3.7 mmol/mol (n=33, 1.0-6.4, p=0.008). Glycaemic metrics from CGM are presented in the table below. There was no significant correlation between percentage weight change and increase in time in range (r -0.218, p=0.239, n=31) nor improvement in the glucose management indicator (GMI) (r 0.099, p=0.597). Side effects were reported by 21 participants (36.8%), with nausea or vomiting the most common (26.3%) and abdominal pain the second most common (14.0%), but 50 participants (87.7%) continued on tirzepatide at 6 months. There were three unplanned admissions related to tirzepatide (median one day length of stay) - all were due to abdominal pain, one of which was found to be caused by gallstones. There were no cases of pancreatitis.

**Conclusion:**
In real-world use in people with T1D, tirzepatide was safe and generally well tolerated, with significant clinical benefits including weight loss, reduced insulin requirements, and improvement of glycae- mic metrics, without increasing hypoglycaemia. Definitive data from RCTs in T1D are required to confirm these findings.

**Background and aims:**
Ecnoglutide is a cAMP-biased long-acting GLP-1 analog being developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ecnoglutide in adults with overweight or obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
A 48-week, double-blind, randomized, pla- cebo-controlled phase 3 study of ecnoglutide was conducted at 36 sites across China, enrolling 664 adults with overweight or obesity. Partici- pants were randomly assigned to once-a-week ecnoglutide (1.2, 1.8 or 2.4 mg) or placebo. Coprimary endpoints were percent change in bodyweight from baseline and proportion of participants with ≥5% bodyweight reduction at week 40. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

**Results:**
At baseline, participants had a mean body weight of 91.3kg, and a mean BMI of 32.5kg/m . After 48 weeks, participants receiving ecnoglutide achieved superior bodyweight reductions of -9.9 to -15.4% from baseline vs -0.3% for placebo (P<0.0001 for all comparisons with placebo), 77.7 to 92.8% of participants receiving ecnoglutide had bodyweight reductions ≥5%, 51.2 to 79.6% had reductions ≥10%, and up to 63.5% had reductions ≥15%. The weight reductions were pro- gressive and did not plateau at the end of study. Ecnoglutide also led to improvements in cardiometabolic indexes including lipid profile and liver fat content. Ecnoglutide was safe and well tolerated. The propor- tion of participants reporting any adverse event (AE) ranged from 92.8 to 93.4% for ecnoglutide cohorts and 84.2% for placebo. A total of ten (2.0%) participants discontinued ecnoglutide due to AE. Five (1.0%) participants in ecnoglutide cohorts reported treatment-related serious AE. The most frequently reported AEs were decreased appetite, diar- rhea, nausea and vomiting, which were mostly mild to moderate in severity and transient.

**Conclusion:**
In adults with overweight or obesity, ecnoglutide once- weekly treatments (1.2, 1.8 and 2.4mg) led to superior and sustained bodyweight reductions over placebo as well as improvements in car- diometabolic indexes.

**ASC30, an oral GLP-1R biased small molecule agonist demon- strated superior weight loss in participants with obesity: a 28-day multiple ascending dose study**

J.J. Wu

**Background and aims:**
ASC30 is an oral GLP-1R biased small mol- ecule agonist without β-arrestin recruitment, discovered and developed in-house at Ascletis. ASC30 has unique and differentiated properties that enable the administration of one small molecule as both a once- monthly subcutaneous injection and a once-daily oral tablet. The completed single ascending dose (SAD) study of ASC30 oral tablet demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics characteristics. We present here the weight loss, pharmacokinetics and tolerability of ASC30 once-daily oral tablet in the first two cohorts of a 28-day multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to treat patients with obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled 28-day MAD study in participants with obesity (BMI of 30-40 kg/m²). This MAD study was conducted in the U.S. Cohort 1 had four dose levels (2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg), while Cohort 2 had four dose levels (2 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg). Patients in each cohort received each dose level of ASC30 oral tablet or matching placebo for seven days in a sequential manner. Each cohort had eight patients on ASC30 once- daily oral tablet treatment, while two patients on the matching placebo.

**Results:**
The mean percent changes of body weight from baselines were -4.3% and -6.3% for MAD cohorts 1 (n=7) and 2 (n=8), respec- tively, on Day 29, compared to -0.1% change in the placebo group (n=4). Placebo-adjusted mean percent body weight changes from baselines were -4.2% (P=0.0016) and -6.2% (P<0.001) for MAD cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, demonstrating statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed mean half-lives at steady state of 42.1 hours and 38.6 hours for the last dose in cohort 1 (20 mg) and cohort 2 (40 mg), respectively. ASC30 once-daily tablet was generally well tolerated in MAD cohorts 1 and 2, with a favorable safety profile. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs). All gastrointestinal (GI)-related adverse events (AEs) were mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2). Weekly titrations of ASC30 oral tablet improved GI tolerability. In MAD cohort 1, there were no inci- dences of vomiting. No clinically significant changes in liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBL) were observed. There were no clini- cally significant findings in laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs (electro- cardiograms, including QTc intervals), and physical exams.

**Conclusion:**
In this MAD study, ASC30 once-daily oral tablet admin- istration induced statistically significant body weight reductions ver- sus placebo, with mean percent body weight changes from baseline of -4.3% and -6.3% in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, after 28 days of oral dosing. ASC30 tablets exhibited a favorable tolerability profile. These findings position the ASC30 once-daily oral tablet as a promis- ing investigational agent for weight management, supporting further evaluation in future clinical trials.

**Background and aims:**
Efforts have focused on developing GLP-1 RAs with less frequent dosing to improve patient acceptance and adher- ence in managing T2D. This randomised, open-label, phase 2b trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel bi-weekly (Q2W) GLP-1 RA, bofanglutide (GZR18), compared to once-weekly (QW) semaglutide (SEMA) in Chinese patients with T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 272 eligible adult patients (HbA1c 7-11%,) who were drug-naïve or on stable treatment with OADs were randomised 1:1:1:1:1 into one of four GZR18 groups (12, 18, 24 mg Q2W and 24 mg QW) or the SEMA group (1 mg QW) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline to week 24. Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

**Results:**
The LSM HbA1c reductions were greater in GZR18 groups (-1.87% to -2.32%) than in the SEMA group (-1.6%), with significant treatment differences in two GZR18 groups (18 mg Q2W and 24 mg QW) vs. SEMA (P<0.001). GZR18 also surpassed SEMA in most secondary efficacy measures, including body weight. The most common TEAEs were Grade 1-2 gastrointestinal AEs. No Grade 3 or higher AEs or severe hypo- glycaemia were related to GZR18.

**Conclusion:**
In Chinese patients with T2D, GZR18 Q2W showed a compa- rable or superior HbA1c and weight reduction than SEMA 1mg QW. This study warrants phase 3 trials of bi-weekly dosing of GZR18 in treating T2D.

2. of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland, 2nd Department of Anesthesiology and

**Background and aims:**
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has become standard of сare in type 1 diabetes and insulin treated patients, and is now widely used in daily diabetes care. However, the patients treated in intensive care units (ICU), who require constant monitor- ing, including blood glucose (BG), might also benefit from CGM use. We conducted the study evaluating the accuracy of CGM in patients requiring treatment in the ICU.

**Materials and methods:**
25 patients treated at a single ICU were enrolled into the study. CGM FreeStyle Libre 2 system was used in all patients since the admission for the maximum of 14 days. CGM system recorded glucose values and transferred them to Android device every minute. Arterial BG concentration was measured as a reference value 8 times a day, and these values were matched with CGM glucose values recorded at the moment of arterial blood sampling.

**Results:**
CGM was conducted in 20 men and 5 women, mean age 54.3±16.1 (20-80) years. They were treated at the ICU because of sepsis (n=8), pneumonia (n=5), acute pancreatitis (n=4), cardiac arrest (n=3) or past surgical procedures (n=5). During the course of the study 1415 glucose value pairs were collected: 1013 (72%) between 100- 180 mg/dl (reference values), 104 (7%) <100 mg/dl and 298 (21%) >180 mg/dl. For all glucose pairs mean reference and CGM glucose (n=1415) was 153±51 and 135±50 mg/dl, respectively, with Pear- son correlation coefficient r=0.889. For BG<100 mg/dl these values were 88±12 and 72±9 mg/dl, r=0.98, for BG 100-180 mg/dl - 138±22 and 120±21, r=0.998; and for BG>180 - 227±52 and 210±50 mg/dl, r=0.991. In patients with circulatory failure at baseline and circula- tory efficient mean reference BG and CGM glucose were 148±39 and 131±42, r=0.833; and 170±75 and 151±69 mg/dl, r=0.944, respec- tively. Also, those with C-reactive protein levels >200 and <200 mg/l had mean reference BG and CGM glucose 143±40 and 121±39, r=0.85; and 162±58 and 148±55 mg/dl, r=0.9. Consistently, CGM val- ues were most often lower than BG values, on average by 14-22 mg/dl, with the greatest difference noted in the patients with CRP>200 mg/l. Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) ranged from 15.4 to 17.3%, depending on the range of glucose values (<100; 100-180; >180 mg/ dl), with the poorest performance in BG>180 mg/dl (Table 1).

**Conclusion:**
CGM can be effectively used in ICU conditions. CGM values highly correlate with arterial BG in ICU patients, with tendency of being lower than arterial BG. CGM is more accurate in low BG (<100 mg/dl) than in high BG (>180 mg/dl) range, which might have important clinical implications. Moreover, CGM accuracy was dimin- ished in patients with more severe infections.

**Comparison of continuous glucose monitoring vs capillary blood glucose monitoring in glycaemic management of hospitalised dia- betic patients**

Y. Lu

**Background and aims:**
The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the clinical value of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and traditional fingertip glucose monitoring in the management of hos- pitalized diabetic patients, focusing on the differences in the quality of blood glucose control, the identification of blood glucose fluctuation characteristics, the detection rate of hypoglycemia events and clinical treatment efficiency between the two monitoring methods.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 327 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes from May 2023 to October 2023 were randomly divided into CGM group (n=145) and control group (n=182). The main out- comes of the study included: (1) blood glucose control parameters: mean blood glucose level (MBG), time in range (TIR), time of hyper- glycaemia (TAR) and time of hypoglycemia (TBR); (2) Blood glucose variability indicators: standard deviation of blood glucose (SDBG), maximum amplitude of glycemic excursions (LAGE), coefficient of variation (CV), postprandial amplitude of glycemic excursions (PPGE); (3) Clinical outcome indicators: the incidence of hypoglycemia at all levels, the time to reach the blood glucose target, and the total length of hospital stay. t test, Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test were used for statistical analysis.

**Results:**
Compared with the control group, the CGM group showed better glycemic control: TIR was significantly increased (82.3% vs 71.4%, P<0.001), TAR was significantly decreased (14.5% vs 28.6%, P<0.001), and MBG was closer to the target range (7.32 vs 8.64mmol/L, P<0.001). In terms of blood glucose variability, LAGE(8.80 vs 6.25mmol/L) and CV(32% vs 27%) were significantly higher in the CGM group than in the control group (P<0.001). In terms of clinical outcomes, more grade 1 (131 vs 55 cases) and grade 2 hypo- glycemic events (56 vs 13 cases) were detected during hospitalization in the CGM group (P<0.001), and the time to target blood glucose was shortened (3 vs 4 days) in the CGM group (P<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Compared with traditional fingertip blood glucose moni- toring system, CGM monitoring system has significant advantages: it can provide more comprehensive blood glucose profile information, more accurately reflect the characteristics of blood glucose fluctuation, significantly improve the detection rate of asymptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia, and significantly shorten the time to reach the target blood glucose by optimizing the treatment plan. These findings support the clinical utility of CGM as the preferred monitoring method in the management of hospitalized diabetic patients.

**Background and aims:**
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves glycaemic control and reduces hypoglycaemia in diabetes management, but its use in geriatric inpatients remains limited. The aim of this study was to assess adherence to CGM during a hospital stay in an acute geriatric unit.

**Materials and methods:**
The GLYCOGER study was a single-centre observational study conducted at our University Hospital. After an initial phase of training caregivers in CGM, patients aged ≥75 years with insulin-requiring diabetes who met the criteria for CGM reim- bursement were included. The primary endpoint was whether the CGM was worn throughout the hospital stay. Secondary endpoints included continuation of CGM at hospital discharge and blood glucose control parameters. Clinical, metabolic and therapeutic factors and association with CGM use were analysed.

**Results:**
Fifty-two patients (median age 85.5 years; 50% female) were included. Adherence to CGM during hospitalisation was 94.2%, with three patients discontinuing treatment due to sensor removal. No adverse events were reported. The median sensor activity rate was 73%, the mean time on target range (70-180 mg/dL) was 67.7% (±19.9), with short time in hypoglycaemia (<70 mg/dL: 1.2% ±2.0). At dis- charge, 77.6% of patients continued to use CGM. Factors associated with continued use of CGM were young age (p = 0.03), macrovascular complications (OR: 6.429 95% CI [1.79-23.08], p = 0.004) and severe polypharmacy (>10 drugs) (OR: 8.5, 95% CI [2.07-34.83], p = 0.002). Discontinuation of CGM was mainly due to insulin discontinuation (72.7%) or death (27.3%). 50% of patients did not experience any hypo- glycaemic episodes during their stay.

**Conclusion:**
Adherence to CGM in an acute geriatric unit was high and the majority of patients continued to use CGM after discharge. Although it is difficult to achieve recommended glycaemic targets dur- ing hospitalisation, only few hypoglycaemia were reported. Optimising the use of CGM requires an increase in the frequency of scans and further training of healthcare professionals to familiarise them with the technology and its clinical interpretation.

**Background and aims:**
To characterise glucose control and insulin use daily and during shifts throughout a hospital stay which might inform treatment planning and improve outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a two-centre randomised trial with 166 non-intensive care unit hospitalised patients with type 2 dia- betes. Diabetes management was performed by regular staff, guided by diabetes teams using insulin titration algorithms based on either point-of-care glucose testing (POC-arm) or CGM (CGM-arm). The primary outcome was the daily differences in time in range (TIR) (3.9- 10.0 mmol/l) between arms.

**Results:**
TIR improved progressively to nearly 90% in the CGM-arm by discharge, compared to 60% in the POC-arm, which plateaued after day 5 (p = 0.007). Both arms showed the lowest TIR and highest insulin use during the day shift (07:00-15:00 h). Correctional insulin doses were lower in the CGM-arm compared to the POC-arm across all shifts: 0.7 IU (±0.3) lower during day shifts (p = 0.016), 1.2 IU (±0.4) lower during evening shifts (15:01-23:00 h, p = 0.005), and 0.3 IU (±0.1) lower during night shifts (23:01-06:59 h, p = 0.038). Prandial insulin doses were 1.1 IU (±0.5) lower during evening shifts in the CGM-arm (p = 0.021).

**Conclusion:**
TIR improved to nearly 90% in the CGM-arm by dis- charge, compared to 60% in the POC-arm, which plateaued after day 5, despite lower daily insulin doses in the CGM-arm. These findings underscore the sustained effectiveness of CGM in enhancing glycemic control throughout the entire duration of hospitalisation.

**Background and aims:**
For people with type 1 diabetes, hospital admission can be challenging due to glycaemic instability and loss of self-management autonomy. Among adults with type 1 diabetes admit- ted to medical and surgical units, we investigated the effectiveness of proactive care from a specialist inpatient diabetes team (versus usual care) on satisfaction with inpatient diabetes care.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted the Specialist Treatment of Inpatients: Caring for Type 1 Diabetes (STOIC-T1D) randomised con- trolled trial at a quaternary hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Adults with type 1 diabetes admitted under a non-endocrinology team were identified electronically and randomised to receive intervention (proac- tive bedside consultation by the diabetes team, without referral, and within one business day of admission) versus usual care (consultation by the diabetes team only when requested by the treating team). The primary endpoint was inpatient satisfaction (assessed using the Dia- betes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Inpatients: DTSQ-IP completed by the participant on a tablet device between day 3 to 7 of admission). The satisfaction score (scored: 6-0, where higher scores indicate greater satisfaction) was calculated as the mean of 17 DTSQ- IP item scores as recommended. Satisfaction was compared between proactive vs. usual care groups. Participants who were unable to com- plete the DTSQ-IP, and those with short (<48-hour) admissions were excluded. Secondary outcomes included inpatient glycaemia based on capillary glucose measurements from admission until discharge (up to a maximum of 14 days).

**Results:**
Between December 2022 and December 2024, 190 individu- als with type 1 diabetes were randomised and 133 (70%) completed the DTSQ-IP (n=66 proactive care, n=67 usual care). Participant charac- teristics were mean (sd) age 57 (18) years, 65% had diabetes duration >20 years, and admission ­HbA was 8.5 (1.6)%. More participants in the intervention arm received specialist diabetes care during their hospital stay (98% vs. 57%, p<0.001), and received it earlier in their admission (median 1 vs. 2 days, p=0.01) compared to usual care. Pro- active care increased the mean (sd) DTSQ-IP score (4.5 (0.9) vs. 4.0 (1.4), p=0.02) compared to usual care and decreased the incidence of glycaemic extremes (patient-days with mean glucose >15 mmol/L, 11% vs. 15%, p=0.016; and patient-days with glucose <3 or >20 mmol/L, 16% vs 21%, p=0.03).

**Conclusion:**
We report the first randomised controlled trial of an inpa- tient diabetes model of care investigating a person-reported primary outcome. Among adults with type 1 diabetes admitted to hospital, early and proactive bedside consultations and support by a specialist diabetes team improves inpatient satisfaction with diabetes care and decreases adverse glycaemic extremes.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes affects over 37 million adults in the United States and presents significant challenges in the inpatient set- ting. Up to 25% of non-critically ill hospitalized patients have diabetes, and many more experience stress-induced hyperglycemia. Both hyper- glycemia and hypoglycemia during hospitalization are associated with increased complications, prolonged lengths of stay, higher readmission rates, and elevated mortality. To address these issues, our Northern California Academic Medical Center initiated a comprehensive quality improvement initiative to transform inpatient glycemic management.

**Materials and methods:**
Beginning in 2019, we launched a system- wide quality improvement initiative at our center. Key interventions included establishing an Inpatient Glycemic Management Team (endo- crinologists and advanced practice nurses), integrating standardized order sets with clinical decision support tools (CDS) in the electronic medical record, developing glycemic dashboards, and implementing a pharmacist co-managed insulin protocol for critical care. Educational efforts targeted both providers and nursing staff through continuing education modules and workflow optimizations such as the “3 Things in 30 Minutes” initiative to synchronize point-of-care [POC] glucose testing, meal delivery, and insulin administration. We analyzed adult acute care inpatients undergoing electronically reported POC glucose testing over seven years, categorizing data into Early (2017-2019), Transition (2020-2021), and Mature (2022-2024) phases. Glucometrics were tracked biannually, focusing on day-weighted mean (DWM) blood glucose >10.0 mmol/L (>180 mg/dL), blood glucose >16.7 mmol/L (>300 mg/dL), and hypoglycemia <3.9 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL) and <3.0 mmol/L (<54 mg/dL). Logistic regression analysis was used to assess differences between phases.

**Results:**
There was a significant reduction in hyperglycemia over the three phases. The percentage of days with a DWM >10.0 mmol/L (>180 mg/dL) declined from 35.2% (95% CI: 34.9%-35.5%) in the Early phase to 33.1% (95% CI: 32.8%-33.4%) in the Transition phase, and further to 31.0% (95% CI: 30.6%-31.3%) in the Mature phase (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Additionally, days with blood glucose >16.7 mmol/L (>300 mg/dL) decreased from 11.3% to 8.4%, hypogly- cemic episodes <3.9 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL) fell from 3.5% to 2.9%, and episodes of severe hypoglycemia <3.0 mmol/L (<54 mg/dL) dropped from 1.1% to 0.8%.

**Conclusion:**
A system-wide, multidisciplinary approach incorporat- ing standardized protocols, data-driven feedback, and targeted educa- tion significantly improved inpatient glycemic control. Our findings demonstrate that comprehensive quality improvement initiatives can effectively reduce both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, enhancing patient safety in a large academic medical center.

**Effect of implementation of inpatient diabetes management service (IDMS) among admitted type 2 diabetes patient in a tertiary care setting 2023-2024**

H. Alkady

**Background and aims:**
DM is a major metabolic disorder with high healthcare costs, particularly in inpatient settings. People with dia- betes are three times more likely to be hospitalized. A 2009 study in a tertiary care center found that type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounted for 33% of admissions. Inspired by the Johns Hopkins Hospital inpatient diabetes model, we developed the Inpatient Diabetes Management Ser- vice (IDMS) to optimize glycemic control, reduce hypo/hyperglycemia, and decrease economic burdens through evidence-based interventions.

**Materials and methods:**
Prospective cohort study, data collection was conducted for baseline assessment & required measures. The pro- ject was conducted with ongoing performance measures monitoring monthly, followed by interventions & action plans accordingly. We performed a prospective study of 731 patients with POCT glucometer readings who were admitted to surgical ward between Jan. to Jun. 2024 and assessed for eligibility. We included adult patient with T2D or hyperglycemia, defined as 2 POCT readings >10mmol/l. Because our system intervention targeted to adult non-pregnant patients in non-crit- ical care unit, patients were excluded if they were in ICU, pregnant or admitted with DKA or Hyperosmolar state. Patients were also excluded if they had fewer than 5 POCT readings during their entire hospitaliza- tion, which we considered the minimum number required to adequately characterized glycemic control. Glycemic outcomes include: (1) Rate of glycemic control (8-10 mmol/l), (2) Rate of hyperglycemia,(3) Rate of Hypoglycemia, (4) ALOS in T2d at surgical ward and(5) Rate of OR cancellation.

**Results:**
Following IDMS implementation, glycemic control improved (57% vs. 45.5% non-IDMS). Hyperglycemia decreased (39% vs. 52%), and hypoglycemia episodes dropped (4.2% to 3.5% from Q1 to Q2). ALOS declined from 12 to 8 days. OR cancellations due to hyperglyce- mia were 0% in both groups. Inpatient consultations decreased by 19% post-IDMS compared to 2023. Monthly education, team feedback, and adherence monitoring contributed to improvements.

**Conclusion:**
These results confirm the clinical benefit of using IDMS among admitted patient with T2D, maintain better glycemic control and decrease rate of hyperglycemia, lower incidence of hypoglycemia which effectively decreasing the economic burden by shortening the Average length of stay and decreasing the volume of inpatient con- sultation. As we finalize our glucose care assessment, we will be able to perform and evaluate the inpatient diabetes Quality Improvement (QI) interventions more efficiently using PDSA cycles to applied not only in surgical ward but across all KFAFH departments. IDMS is an important area for patient safety, QI, and clinical research. We hope that the implementation model will guide our hospital to improve the quality and safety of inpatient diabetes care.

**Background and aims:**
Hypoglycemia remains a frequent complica- tion during hospitalization in subjects with diabetes, who represent around 20-30% of hospitalized patients. Some reports indicate that proactively assuming diabetes management by a specialized diabetes team (SDT) reduces the length of stay (LOS). However, its specific impact on hypoglycemia, a meaningful factor accounting for the LOS, has not been examined. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is not generally implemented in the hospitalization setting, but it could rep- resent a promising strategy to reduce hypoglycemia in this setting. The main aim of the present study is to assess the risk factors for presenting hypoglycemia during hospitalization and to evaluate whether the man- agement of diabetes by a SDT has any impact on the LOS. In addition, the specific groups at risk of hypoglycemia and, therefore, in which CGM should be prioritized will be identified.

**Materials and methods:**
A Smart Diabetes Hospital consisting of a glycemic map linked to SDT (endocrinologist + diabetes nurse) has been implemented progressively in medical and surgical floors at a University Hospital. Data regarding glycemic control, hypoglycemia, clinical characteristics and LOS were collected from October 2021 to April 2024, before and after the implementation of the SDH. Sur- gical (Vascular Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Gastrointestinal Surgery, Hepatobiliary Surgery) and medical floors (Nephrology, Neurology, Hematology, Oncology) have been included.

**Results:**
A total of 900 subjects were included. Hypoglycemia during admission was reported in 9.7% of patients, and the mean of hypogly- cemic episodes per patient was 1,78 ± 1,75. The use of insulin previous to the admission was an important risk factor. Patients with hypoglyce- mia presented longer LOS (26.1±25 vs 13.9±13, p<0.001) and higher mortality at 3 months of follow up (26.5% vs 9.5%, p=0.002). The SDT was able to reduce the number of patients with hypoglycemia (13.3% vs 6.7%, p<0.001) and the rate of hypoglycemia (2.12±2.13 vs 1.21 ± 0.41, p=0,024). Notably, the LOS (16.49±17.4 vs. 14.14±13.2, p<0.001) and mortality at 3 months (5.3% vs 2.8%, p=0.021) were also reduced with the implementation of the SDT. Moreover, the ser- vices of nephrology and neurology where those with higher rate of hypoglycemia.

**Conclusion:**
The implementation of SDT in hospitalized patients reduces hypoglycemia, LOS and mortality at 3 months after discharge. We also found that patients hospitalized in nephrology and neurology units presented higher risk of developing hypoglycemia, in particular those who were using insulin before the admission, thus suggesting that CGM should be prioritized in these groups of patients.

1. Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark, Stene Diabetes

**Background and aims:**
Precision and personalized medicine is on the rise in the medical research and clinical communities, and have shown great promise in identifying potential risk scores, treatment targets, and causal markers in diabetes. However, the methods used are often nontransparent for most treating physicians. For future people living with diabetes to be treated based on results derived from such methods, acceptance and trust need to be established. We set out to assess the attitude towards personalized medicine in individuals with diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Between May 3-14, 2024, 300 individu- als with diabetes were invited to an online questionnaire including five questions regarding attitude towards personalized medicine. The invitees were members of a patient council at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, a tertiary diabetes hospital in Denmark. Of 300 invited, 125 responded to the entire online questionnaire. The questionnaire was in Danish and included five questions regarding their attitude towards personalized/precision medicine.

**Results:**
Of the 125 individuals, 80 were men (64%) and 80 (64%) had type 1 diabetes and 45 (36%) type 2 diabetes. Their diabetes duration was distributed evenly from <5 years to 20+ years. Most participants included have at least a short-cycle higher education or more (74%), 52% were currently employed, and 39% were retired. Only 45% of participants had previously heard about personalized medicine. After a short description, 92% had a very positive or positive opinion of personalized medicine; none had a negative opinion. Participants were described a scenario in which a test with a high false positive rate (30%) was available to them, which could suggest a treatment for a disease. The disease was rare leading to many false positives, and the treatment had substantial side effects. In this scenario, only 29% would accept the test and treatment, while 26% of participants would completely decline the test. The rest would accept if the false positive rate was lower. The next question describes a scenario in which the participant had the option to accept an AI-derived test result and treatment recommenda- tion, but the treating phycisian does not understand the methodology of the test. Only 6% or participants would decline, 32% would accept the test and treatment, while 62% would accept after discussing with their treating physician. Finally, due to personalized/precision medi- cine requiring large amounts of personal data, participants were asked which entities they would allow access to their, anonymized, medical data. Almost all accepted that hospitals gain access to it (94%), and most accepted access from general practitioners (70%) and academic institutions such as universities (54%). However, only few participants would accept access from insurance companies, pharmacies, or patient organizations (9-15%). The replies were similar across individuals type 1 or type 2 diabetes and no significant differences between diabetes types were seen for any of the questions (p>0.071).

**Conclusion:**
In summary, many individuals with diabetes had never heard of personalized medicine, but when informed, almost all were universally positive about it. They were generally accepting of tests and treatment suggestions derived from precision medicine methods but would not willingly accept substantial side effects for imprecise treatment suggestions.

**Background and aims:**
Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating (DAFNE) is an evidence-based, 5-day, group programme supporting adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to develop their self-management skills, optimising their glycaemic management, health and quality of life. Despite proven effectiveness, DAFNE ‘graduates’ find it challeng- ing to achieve and maintain real-world benefits. Thus, a recent cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) compared DAFNE to enhanced DAFNE, aka DAFNE . The aims of this secondary analysis were to determine whether: a) there are meaningful clusters of participants with shared characteristics among those eligible for the cRCT; b) identified clusters respond differently to DAFNE and DAFNE at 12-month follow-up in terms of HbA1c and diabetes-specific quality of life.

**Materials and methods:**
Latent profile analysis was conducted on the DAFNEplus cRCT dataset using relevant indicator variables: age; HbA1c; hypoglycaemia awareness; diabetes-specific quality of life (ADDQoL-15 Average Weighted Impact (AWI)), diabetes distress (PAID-20); diabetes-specific positive well-being (4-item scale of the W-BQ28); fear of hypoglycaemia (HFS-II); and satisfaction with dia- betes management (DME-Q). Model fit indices were used to select the optimal number of clusters and, in each cluster, multilevel linear regres- sion models were used to estimate the effect of DAFNEplus (versus DAFNE) on HbA1c and diabetes-specific quality of life.

**Results:**
A total of N=363 participants were included in the analysis (n=147 (40%) randomised to DAFNEplus). The final model included two clusters which were differentiated by overall worse (cluster 1) ver- sus better (cluster 2) clinical and psychological indicator variables. At 12 months, there was a significant adjusted mean difference between arms in diabetes-specific quality of life (ADDQoL: 0.81 =0.01), favouring DAFNE (Cluster 1 only), but not in HbA1c (Figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that adults with T1D eligible for the DAFNE cRCT fit broadly into two clusters, with one cluster experiencing significant added benefit following DAFNE (com- pared to DAFNE) for quality of life at 12 months; but not HbA1c. Findings may inform DAFNE programme eligibility and rollout considerations to enable quality of life benefits for those adults with T1D with greatest unmet needs.

**Stay on Top of Your Diabetes: insights from a one-year follow-up study**

A. Nikontovic

**Background and aims:**
Historically, the North Denmark Region has faced challenges in meeting diabetes treatment criteria, particularly in achieving long-term glycemic control (HbA1c). To address this, the a Diabetes Center in North Denmark, in collaboration with the Depart- ment of Endocrinology at Aalborg University Hospital, developed a new quality plan in 2019. This initiative included the implementation of a fast-track program called "Stay on Top of Your Diabetes," aimed at supporting patients with poor glycemic control. The program’s core component is a structured 12-month intervention featuring intensified follow-up by both a physician and a nurse. The focus is on supporting better adherence through a collaborative team-based approach with the patient. Improved glycemic control is achieved through behav- ioral change and, for T1D patients, insulin titration, while for T2D patients, it is through identifying the optimal treatment regimen. A 2023 study presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) demonstrated significant improvements in glycemic control among program participants. The current study extends this work by adding a greater program population and assessing whether these improvements are sustained one year after program completion.

**Materials and methods:**
From January 2021 to March 2025, patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) who met the following criteria were enrolled in the program: persistent poor gly- cemic control over at least the last three hospital visits (HbA1c ≥ 70 mmol/mol) and referral by an endocrinologist based on a comprehen- sive clinical assessment. Patients were evaluated at the Department of Endocrinology every three months, with HbA1c measured at each visit. The study is structured into three phases: Baseline period (-12 to 0 months); Intervention period (0 to 12 months); Post-intervention period (12 to 24 months). To assess differences between these phases, a Shewhart statistical process control (SPC) chart was constructed. Additionally, patients who participated in "Stay on Top of Your Diabetes" were compared to the general diabetes popu- lation using a propensity score matching (PSM) approach with nearest neighbor matching, accounting for age, gender, diabetes duration, and technology use.

**Results:**
A total of 198 patients were enrolled in "Stay on Top of Your Diabetes" (140 with T1D and 50 with T2D). For T1D patients, HbA1c levels dropped from 81.6 mmol/mol in Phase 0 to 73.4 mmol/mol in Phase 1, further improving to 69.1 mmol/mol in Phase 2. For T2D patients, HbA1c levels declined from 89.7 mmol/mol to 75.3 mmol/ mol, stabilizing at 72.3 mmol/mol. The PSM model confirmed sig- nificant differences in glycemic control program participants and the general diabetes population.

**Conclusion:**
The "Stay on Top of Your Diabetes" program effectively improved glycemic control in patients with both T1D and T2D, dem- onstrating sustained reductions in HbA1c levels even one year after program completion. The structured 12-month intervention led to sig- nificant improvements, with HbA1c levels stabilizing post-intervention. Propensity score matching revealed significant differences between pro- gram participants and the general diabetes population, emphasizing the importance of targeted interventions for patients with poor glycemic control. These findings support the long-term effectiveness of struc- tured, multidisciplinary care programs in diabetes management.

**Gaps and opportunities for strengthening in-school support for young people with type 1 diabetes: a freedom of information investigation**

S.E.R. Dry

**Background and aims:**
Children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) are less active than recommended and than their peers without T1D. Several barriers to physical activity have been reported, including fear of hypoglycaemia and lack of confidence in the support received from those who facilitate physical activity including PE teach- ers . Schools, as primary environments for daily PA, are critical settings for providing structured support to ensure safe participation for students with T1D, but little is known about the provision of support in schools, including policies and training for staff.

**Materials and methods:**
A cross-sectional quantitative survey was conducted via Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, distributed to 7,354 secondary schools and colleges across England between Janu- ary and February 2025. The survey comprised 13 questions, including items on the presence of personalised care plans, formal diabetes poli- cies, and staff training related to the management of T1D during physi- cal activity. Schools were given the option to complete the survey either through an attached table in the email or via an online platform (Sur- veyMonkey). A total of 590 schools submitted completed responses via SurveyMonkey. Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarise the data and chi-square tests of independence were conducted to exam- ine associations between the presence of diabetes-related policies and support mechanisms such as PE staff training, trained first aiders, and policy document submission.

**Results:**
Of the 590 schools that responded via SurveyMonkey, the vast majority (91.7%, = 541) reported having personalised care plans in place for students with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Additionally, 82.5% ( = 487) had trained first aiders available to manage diabetes-related emergencies. However, only 69.5% ( = 410) indicated that their PE staff had received specific training in the management of T1D dur- ing physical activity. Chi-square analysis revealed no statistically sig- nificant associations between the presence of a formal diabetes policy and other support mechanisms, including PE staff training ( ²(1) = 0.010, = 0.922), trained first aiders ( ²(1) = 0.192, = 0.661), or policy upload ( ²(1) = 0.015, p = 0.901).

**Conclusion:**
Over 30% of schools reported no specific T1D training for PE staff, and nearly half had no formal policy in place. These findings highlight a critical gap in the structured support necessary to facilitate safe and supportive PA participation for students with T1D. Greater integration of school policies and staff training are needed to ensure consistent and effective diabetes care in educational settings.

**Background and aims:**
The NHS England hybrid closed loop (HCL) pilot provided access to HCL for adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D), managed with an insulin pump and intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring, with a HbA1c ≥8.5% (69 mmol/mol). We assessed whether the achievement of glycaemic targets was associated with reduced diabetes-related distress (DRD) in HCL users at follow up.

**Materials and methods:**
Anonymised data were collected via a secure online tool. We performed Chi-square tests to analyse whether there is a significant difference in DRD (defined as two-item diabetes distress score [DDS2] ≥3) between individuals who achieved glycaemic tar- gets [HbA1c <7.5% or <7.0%, time in range (TIR) (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) >70%, time above range (>10.0 mmol/L) <25%, time below range (<3.9 mmol/L) <4%] at follow-up and those who did not meet such targets. Logistic regression analysis was performed to test associations between glucose outcomes and DRD at follow-up.

**Results:**
A total of 420 HCL users across 30 diabetes centres in the UK were included (median age 40 [IQR 29-50] years, 68% female, 85% White British). Over a median follow-up of 12 months (IQR 8-28), HbA1c decreased by 1.3% (14 mmol/mol) (95% CI -1.4, -1.2; P < 0.001) and TIR increased by 26.7% (95% CI 25.0, 28.3; P < 0.001). The proportion of individuals with DRD reduced from 67.4% at base- line to 23.1% at follow-up (P < 0.001). Only 11.8% of those achieving HbA1c <7.5% reported DRD, compared to 24.9% of those with HbA1c ≥7.5% (P = 0.009). Similarly, 12.6% of those meeting TIR >70% had DRD, compared to 24% of those with TIR ≤70% (P = 0.02). The proportion of people with DRD across several glycaemic targets is shown in Table 1. In univariate logistic regression analysis, HbA1c was positively associated with DRD (OR 1.29; [95% CI 1.02, 1.62]; P = 0.035), while TIR was negatively associated with DRD (OR 0.96; [95% CI 0.95, 0.98]; P <0.001). There was no correlation between time below range (<3.9 mmol/L) and DRD (P = 0.26). Higher glycaemic variability, expressed as percentage coefficient of variation, was associ- ated with higher DRD (OR 1.06; [95% CI 1.01, 1.1]; P = 0.01).

**Conclusion:**
Achieving glycaemic targets with HCL therapy in adults with T1D is associated with lower levels of diabetes distress. Further research is needed to understand the drivers of DRD in HCL users.

**The effect of socioeconomic deprivation on HbA reduction in insulin pump users**

T.D. Behan

1. University Hospitals Dorset, Bournemouth, UK, Royal Bournemouth

**Background and aims:**
Insulin pump therapy is a well-established intervention for improving glycaemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the impact of socioeconomic deprivation on HbA1c reduction following pump initiation remains unclear. This study aimed to assess if HbA1c reduction and the rate of improvement over 12 months differed between deprivation groups.

**Materials and methods:**
588 insulin pump users were initially included, with 262 excluded due to insufficient data, leaving a final cohort of 326 participants. Socio-economic deprivation was assessed by the English Indices of Deprivation 2015 & 2019. Participants were stratified into four deprivation groups (1-3 [most deprived], 4-6, 7-8, and 9-10 [least deprived]). HbA1c was recorded at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-pump initiation. Paired t-tests assessed within-group HbA1c changes. Normality of HbA1c differences between baseline and 12 months was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. If normality was met (p > 0.05), paired t-tests were performed. If normality was violated (p < 0.05), a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was used. One-way ANOVA compared overall HbA1c reductions between deprivation groups and Tukey HSD post-hoc tests identified significant pairwise differences. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to determine whether the rate of HbA1c reduction differed over time. Confidence intervals (CI, 95%) were calculated for baseline and 12-month HbA1c values across all groups. A significance threshold of p < 0.05 was applied for all tests.

**Results:**
Baseline HbA1c levels were highest in group 1-3 (Mean: 72.52 mmol/mol, CI: 67.55-74.25) and lowest in group 9-10 (Mean: 69.24 mmol/mol, CI: 64.86-71.95). By 12 months, mean HbA1c levels improved to 62.63 mmol/mol (CI: 58.34-66.91) in group 1-3 and 63.75 mmol/mol (CI: 60.83-66.67) in group 9-10, indicating a comparable long-term benefit across all groups. All deprivation groups experienced a significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline to 12 months (p < 0.001). Group 1-3, the most deprived, had the greatest mean HbA1c reduction (8.28 mmol/mol), while group 7-8 had the smallest reduction (3.96 mmol/mol). Normality testing revealed that HbA1c differences followed a normal distribution in group 1-3 (p = 0.38). However, groups 4-6 (p = 0.043), 7-8 (p < 0.0001), and 9-10 (p = 0.014) devi- ated from normality. Consequently, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Tests were conducted, confirming significant HbA1c reductions across all groups (p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant differences in overall HbA1c reduction were detected between groups (ANOVA: p = 0.171, F = 1.68). The rate of HbA1c reduction differed significantly over time (p < 0.001). Groups 1-3 and 4-6 exhibited the steepest initial declines, achieving greater reductions within the first 6 months, whereas groups 7-8 and 9-10 experienced a more gradual but steady decline over 12 months. By 12 months, all groups reached similar HbA1c levels.

**Conclusion:**
Insulin pump therapy significantly improved HbA1c across all socioeconomic deprivation levels, with no major dispari- ties in long-term glycaemic benefit. However, participants from more deprived backgrounds (groups 1-3) had significantly higher baseline HbA1c levels and achieved a faster reduction in HbA1c compared to the least deprived group.

3. Denmark, Data Science, Novo Nordisk, Søborg, Denmark.

**Background and aims:**
Telemonitoring can improve glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but uncertainty remains regard- ing which technologies to incorporate in a telemonitoring intervention. Physical activity is important in managing T2D; hence the integra- tion of activity trackers seems relevant in telemonitoring interven- tions. However, only a few studies have integrated activity trackers in telemonitoring, and little is known about the activity tracker adherence among people with insulin-dependent T2D. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate adherence to activity trackers in a telemonitoring setting.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a post hoc analysis on a completed open-label randomized controlled trial (DiaMonT), which investigated the effect of a three-month telemonitoring intervention for people with insulin-dependent T2D. The telemonitoring group received an activity tracker (Fitbit Charge 4) and was instructed to wear it continuously throughout the trial period (day and night). For the analysis, heart rate data were used for estimating wear time, and only the first 12 weeks of the trial period were included to prevent missing data during the close- out period. The wear time was estimated as; 1) number of days worn, and 2) number of hours worn per day. The variation in wear time during the 12-week period was assessed as; 1) the proportion of participants wearing the activity tracker, and 2) the daily wear time (hours/day) for each week. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the vari- ation in daily wear time between the weeks.

**Results:**
A total of 163 participants were included in the analysis. Activity tracker wear time was 74.5±19.4 days during the 84-day period, and the daily wear time was 19.3±7.9 hours/day. Ninety-nine percent of the participants (n=161) used the activity tracker in week one, decreasing to 88% (n=144) in week 12 (Figure). The daily wear time varied significantly during the period (p<0.01) with the highest wear time at the beginning (Figure).

**Conclusion:**
This study indicates that people with insulin-dependent T2D have a high adherence to activity trackers in a telemonitoring setting, although wear time decreases slightly over time. Thus, based on adherence, activity trackers could be integrated in a telemonitoring intervention, although further research is needed to determine their relevance.

**Predicting no-shows in a Diabetes Center in North Denmark: a machine learning approach**

A. Nikontovic

**Background and aims:**
No-shows are a problem that may negatively impact diabetes management. In Region North Denmark (RND), small- scale interventions, such as patient lists with previous no-shows and reminder calls prior to consultations, have shown a modest effect in reducing no-shows. We wanted to explore the issue of no-shows fur- ther, which led to the development of this project and an increased focus on identifying patterns of no-shows. The aim is to develop a model that can accurately predict no-shows and support the diabetes outpatient clinic in optimizing patient follow-up in RND.

**Materials and methods:**
Data were collected from patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes attending the Aalborg Endocrinology Department between March 2019 and March 2025, covering all types of consulta- tions. In this study, three predictive models were developed: Model 1: Clinical values Model 2: Clinical values combined with behavio- ral data Model 3: Clinical values combined with behavioral data and patient reported outcomes A Multilayer Perceptron classifier was then employed to predict patient no-shows, with feature importance assessed using permutation importance and sequential feature selection (SFS) to identify the most informative variables. Calibration curves were applied to evaluate and adjust model probability estimates.

**Results:**
A total of 5,302 patients and 48,138 appointments were included, with 5,833 no-shows, yielding a 12.1% no-show rate. The initial analysis shows that patients with type 1 diabetes were twice as likely to miss an appointment compared to those with type 2 diabe- tes in the dataset. SFS was performed on the three models, and when combining the different informative variables, it showed that the best model was Model 3, which achieved an AUC of 0.78. Major predictors included weekday, prior no-shows, appointment time, diabetes type, and WHO-5 score. This model could have several potential applica- tions, including automated scheduling and the identification of high- risk individuals prior to appointments. The model will be presented in more detail at the conference.

**Conclusion:**
No-shows remain a significant barrier to effective diabetes management, particularly among patients with type 1 diabetes. This study demonstrates that integrating clinical, behavioral, and patient- reported data improves the prediction of missed appointments, with the best-performing model achieving an AUC of 0.78. Key predic- tive factors highlight opportunities for intervention, such as targeted scheduling strategies and risk-based patient engagement. The predic- tive model holds promise for improving clinic efficiency and patient outcomes, with potential applications in automated booking systems and proactive patient identification.

**Background and aims:**
We aimed to examine the association between various continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics and pregnancy outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

**Materials and methods:**
The CRISTAL study was a randomized controlled trial, comparing the MiniMed™ 780G with standard insu- lin therapy in 95 pregnant women with T1D and indicated improved pregnancy-specific time in range (TIRp) overnight. This secondary analysis assessed the association between CGM metrics and pregnancy outcomes. Logistic regression and Spearman correlations, adjusted for baseline HbA1c, were used to analyze binary and continuous outcomes. Data are presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

**Results:**
Each 5% increase in TIRp was associated with lower odds of gestational hypertension (0.63; 0.41-0.97), birthweight >4.5 kg (0.56; 0.32-0.96) and neonatal hypoglycemia requiring neonatal care (0.09; 0.01-0.57). Each 5% increase in TIRp overnight reduced the odds of gestational hypertension (0.71; 0.52-0.98) and neonatal care for hypoglycemia (0.15; 0.03-0.79). Each 5% increase in time above the pregnancy-specific range (TARp) was associated with birthweight >4.5 kg (1.76; 1.05-2.96), respiratory distress (1.55; 1.02-2.37), and neonatal hypoglycemia requiring neonatal care (5.1; 1.14-22.78). Every 5 mg/dL increase in mean glycemia was associated with higher odds for respiratory distress (1.54; 1.07-2.23), while every 5 mg/dL increase in glucose standard deviation raised the odds of gestational hypertension (1.69; 1.02-2.80) and birthweight > 4.5 kg (2.31; 1.20-4.43).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings indicate that, along with TIRp and TARp, overnight TIRp, mean glycemia and glycemic variability are important predictors of pregnancy outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a highly heterogeneous disorder. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is beneficial to aassess diurnal blood glucose variability and its association with abnormal fetal growth during pregnancy. Given the substantial interindividual differences among patients, stratify- ing GDM into distinct subtypes based on clinical characteristics and CGM parameters may facilitate the development of more tailored therapeutic approaches. This study aims to classify GDM subtypes through cluster analysis incorporating clinical features and CGM metrics and to explore their associations with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
This prospective cohort study enrolled 717 singleton pregnant women diagnosed with GDM who underwent CGM during pregnancy. Hierarchical clustering was initially performed based on clinical characteristics, followed by k-means clustering utilizing CGM metrics in a subset of participants, resulting in the identifica- tion of five distinct GDM subtypes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the associations between these GDM subtypes and adverse pregnancy outcomes, with adjustments for pre- pregnancy body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and triglyceride levels.

**Results:**
Five distinct GDM subtypes were identified based on clinical characteristics and CGM metrics: well-controlled GDM, suboptimally controlled GDM, suboptimally controlled GDM with hypoglycemia, poorly controlled GDM with hyperglycemia, and early-onset GDM. After adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI, HbA1c, and triglyceride levels, compared to the well-controlled group, the poorly controlled GDM with hyperglycemia demonstrated a higher likelihood of requiring insulin therapy during pregnancy (OR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.39-4.86) and an increased risk of large for gestational age (LGA) (OR: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.66-5.95). The suboptimally controlled GDM with hypoglycemia exhibited a greater risk of LGA compared to the well-controlled group (OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.01-3.62). Furthermore, the early-onset GDM was associated with increased risks of gestational hypertensive disorders (OR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.21-8.49) and preeclampsia (OR: 3.56, 95% CI: 1.18-10.72) compared to the well-controlled group.

**Conclusion:**
Employing an unsupervised machine learning approach, this study identified novel GDM subtypes based on clinical characteris- tics and CGM metrics. These subtypes demonstrated significant varia- tions in insulin therapy requirements and adverse pregnancy outcomes, highlighting their clinical significance. This classification framework may contribute to the development of personalized treatment strategies and provide deeper insights into the heterogeneity of GDM.

**Background and aims:**
The optimal glucose targets in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains unknown. This study aimed to inves- tigate the threshold of hyperglycemia associated with adverse outcomes in GDM using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

**Materials and methods:**
This prospective cohort study recruited a total of 717 singleton pregnant women with GDM performing CGM during pregnancy. Time above ranges (TARs) were calculated as the percentage of time above the glucose thresholds from 5.6 to 8.1 mmol/L (100 to 145 mg/dl, increase by 5mg/dl each) during the whole CGM period respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve analysis were employed to explore the optimal threshold and range of TAR.

**Results:**
Of the 717 GDM women, 172 (24.0%) had LGA infants, and 144 (20.1%) had composite adverse outcomes. Only TARs with a threshold of 6.9 mmol/L (TAR​ ) or above were significantly associ- ated with the risk of LGA after adjusting confounders. For per absolute 5% increase in TAR​ , the risk of LGA was increased by 9.8% (OR 1.098, 95% CI: 1.008, 1.195). RCS curve showed that when TAR​ > 26.0%, the risk of LGA increases with elevating TAR​ .

**Conclusion:**
A glucose level exceeding 6.9 mmol/L and TAR​ > 26.0% were significantly associated with higher risk of LGA in women with GDM. Strict glycemic control may result in better prognoses.

**Background and aims:**
There is a lack of evidence regarding the interpretation and clinical relevance of continuous glucose monitor- ing (CGM)-derived parameters in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to evaluate early CGM metrics in relation to over- all pregnancy CGM data, standard glycaemic markers, and perinatal outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial included 92 women with GDM, using intermittently scanned CGM continuously, from study enrolment until the delivery. CGM data from the first 14 days (early CGM) were compared with full- duration CGM metrics, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c at baseline and follow-up), self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) parameters (fast- ing and 1-hour postprandial), maternal factors, insulin therapy initia- tion, and perinatal outcomes. CGM metrics included pregnancy time in range (pTIR), time above range (pTAR), and time below range (pTBR), defined as time spent within 3.5-7.8 mmol/L, above 7.8 mmol/L, and below 3.5 mmol/L, espectively.Correlations were assessed using the Spearman’s test.

**Results:**
While early pTIR was not significantly associated with HbA1c or SMBG parameters,early pTAR showed positive associa- tions with HbA1c at baseline (ρ = 0.228, p = 0.028),overall SMBG postprandial mean (ρ = 0.296, p = 0.003), and a smaller proportion of postprandial values within the target range <7.8 mmol/L (ρ = -0.285, p = 0.004). pTBR was inversely associated with SMBG fasting mean(ρ = -0.273, p = 0.011) and HbA1c at follow-up (ρ = -0.209, p = 0.049). Early CGM mean glucose values (24h, day and night) showed strong correlations with the corresponding full-preg- nancy period CGM metrics.Higher early CGM mean glucose was associated with the need for insulin therapy (ρ = 0.330, p = 0.002). Greater sensor scan activity, correlated with a lower HbA1c at base- line (ρ = -0.330, p = 0.003), insulin therapy (ρ = -0.212, p = 0.041), a lower birthweight percentile (ρ = -0.323, p = 0.002)and reduced incidence of large-for-gestational-age births (ρ = -0.294, p = 0.005).

**Conclusion:**
Early CGM parameters, particularly pTAR, pTBR and average sensor glucose, were associated with overall glycaemic control in women with GDM. These findings support the potential use of at least early CGM data to guide individualized treatment and monitor- ing strategies. However, further research is needed to define optimal target thresholds that minimize the risk of both large- and small-for- gestational-age births.

**Background and aims:**
Data on subcutaneous glucose monitoring and glycaemic targets in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are limited. We aimed to evaluate the impact of intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) on glycaemic and perinatal outcomes in GDM.

**Materials and methods:**
In this single-centre, randomized controlled trial, women with GDM were randomly assigned to either isCGM combined with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), or SMBG alone. Both groups were followed biweekly until delivery. The isCGM group used sensors continuously from enrolment until delivery. The primary outcome was glycaemic control assessed by SMBG; second- ary outcomes included maternal and fetal perinatal outcomes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and isCGM-derived metrics. Statistical analy- sis used Mann-Whitney U tests.Participants also completed a study- specific questionnaire assessing satisfaction with isCGM. The items (on a scale from 1, lowest, to 5, highest) addressed usability, perceived benefit, and overall experience.

**Results:**
From 201 women enrolled, the isCGM + SMBG (n=98) and SMBG alone (n=103) groups had comparable baseline charac- teristics, including age, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, smoking status, and family history of diabetes (all p > 0.05). Median fasting glu- cose was 4.78 mmol/L[4.54-4.99] and 4.73 mmol/L [4.48-5.00]in the isCGM + SMBG group and in the SMBG group, respectively (p = 0.863). However, 1-hour postprandial SMBG glucose was sig- nificantly lower in the SMBG group: 6.1 mmol/L [5.8-6.4] vs. 6.3 mmol/L [5.9-6.7] (p = 0.042).The proportion of fasting SMBG val- ues within the target range was 0.83 [0.75-0.97] and 0.87 [0.81-0.97) in the isCGM + SMBG group and the SMBG group, respectively (p = 0.344). In addition, the proportion of postprandial SMBG values- within thetarget range and HbA1c did not differ between the groups (p = 0.218). There were no significant differences in gestational age at delivery, caesarean section rate, labor induction, neonatal birth weight, birth weight percentile, large for gestational age births, small for gestational age births, or other neonatal complications. Women reported high satisfaction with isCGM, with the highest-rated items being “Gained knowledge useful for future pregnancies” (mean 4.73 ± 0.49), and “Sensor improved understanding of glucose dynamics” (mean 4.31 ± 0.90). Items reflecting discomfort or inconvenience (e.g., “Sensor insertion was painful” or “Sensor disturbed daily life”) were rated low (means <2.0). Notably, participants reported a high willingness to use sensor again in a future pregnancy (mean 3.75 ± 1.09; median= 5), indicating overall positive experiences among users.

**Conclusion:**
In women with GDM, the use of SMBG alone was associ- ated with slightly better postprandial glycaemic control compared to combined isCGM and SMBG. No significant differences were observed in fasting glycaemia, HbA1c, insulin use or perinatal outcomes between the groups. High satisfaction and future-use intention among isCGM users highlight its acceptability and practical value in routine GDM care.

**Background and aims:**
Increasing numbers of women with obesity are undertaking bariatric surgery to lose weight and improve their chances of conception. However, during pregnancy, these women remain at higher risk of gestational diabetes (GDM) and associated complica- tions. Pregnancy after bariatric surgery presents unique challenges for glycaemic monitoring due to rapid glucose absorption and altered gut hormone and insulin secretion on the background of changes in insulin sensitivity during pregnancy. These factors compromise the tolerability and reliability of traditional GDM diagnostic methods, such as the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and glycaemic measurement like HbA1c, which is a predictive marker of complications in women with GDM. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers alternative met- rics, such as the Glucose Management Indicator (GMI) and Time in Range between 63-140 mg/dL or 3.5-7.8 mmol/L (TIR), which better reflect real-time glycaemia. TIR has been associated with improved outcomes in pregnancies complicated by diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
This analysis used data from CGM (blinded Dexcom G6 sensor for 10 days) and laboratory-measured HbA1c (matched within a one-week window) from an ongoing prospective cohort study of pregnancy following bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy), conducted at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. TIR was defined as the percentage of time CGM glucose values were between 3.5 and 7.8 mmol/L. GMI was calcu- lated from mean CGM glucose using a validated equation. Pearson correlation and linear regression were used to assess associations between GMI, HbA1c, and TIR.

**Results:**
76 CGM recordings from 44 individuals with matched labo- ratory-measured HbA1c values were analysed. The mean participant age was 33.0 ± 4.3 years and pre-pregnancy BMI was 28.3 ± 5.2 kg/ m². HbA1c and GMI showed a weak, non-significant correlation (r = 0.21, p = 0.068). GMI was moderately and significantly correlated with time in range (TIR; r = -0.58, p < 0.001), while HbA1c showed a weaker but also significant association (r = -0.31, p = 0.007). In a multiple linear regression model ( (2,73) = 22.92, p < 0.001; R² = 0.39), GMI remained a strong independent predictor of TIR (β = -2.08, p < 0.001), whereas HbA1c was not significant after adjusting for GMI (β = -0.57, p = 0.078).

**Conclusion:**
In pregnant individuals following bariatric surgery, HbA1c was poorly correlated with CGM-derived measures of gly- caemia such as GMI and TIR. Future work should aim to correlate CGM-based metrics with maternal and neonatal outcomes to inform the management of glycaemia in post-bariatric pregnancies.

**Background and aims:**
Several studies with previous-generation continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have demonstrated that, when worn in parallel, different systems can display discord- ant glucose profiles, which can affect the CGM-derived metrics. To assess the persistence of this issue with current-generation devices, CGM data from a recent head-to-head CGM performance study in which participants wore three different CGM systems of the principal manufacturers simultaneously were analyzed.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from 23 participants wearing the FreeStyle Libre 3 (FL3), Dexcom G7 (DG7) and Medtronic Simplera (MSP) CGM systems for 14 days in parallel were used to calculate time below range (TBR, <70 mg/dL), time in tight range (TITR, 70-140 mg/dL), time in range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dL), time above range (TAR, >180 mg/dL) and glucose management indicator (GMI) for each participant and CGM system separately. For that, only time periods in which all three systems recorded data simultaneously and participants with a data availability >70% were included.

**Results:**
The population-level medians of CGM-derived metrics for the three CGM systems are shown in the table below. Significant differences (p<0.05) were found between FL3 and MSP for TBR, as well as FL3 and MSP, and DG7 and MSP for all other metrics. In 48% of participants, the CGM systems did not agree on whether the TBR target of <4% was met. For the TIR target (>70%) and the TAR target (<25%), the corresponding share of participants with diverging therapy target compliance was 22% and 35%, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
This study found considerable differences between CGM-derived metrics reported by different, current-generation CGM systems in the same person. Agreement between FL3 and DG7 was generally higher than with MSP. Comparing glycemic metrics across CGM systems is challenging, and patients may receive dif- ferent therapeutic recommendations and manage their diabetes dif- ferently depending on the CGM system they use. This should be considered when switching between CGM systems or assessing the effectiveness of automated insulin delivery systems that utilize dif- ferent CGM systems.

**Background and aims:**
Evaluate the sensitivity of alternative CGM metrics for detection of the effects of clinical interventions in people with T1D and T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Retrospective cross-sectional real-world data from people with poor glycemic control (HbA1c 8.2 ± 1.3 %) for 120 PwT1D using MDI, and 92 PwT2D using oral agents and/or insulin, using Libre isCGM for 3 days at admission and 2 days at discharge from in-hospital care with changes in therapy prescribed by separate physicians. CGM metrics included: Q-Score, TIR (3.9 -10 mmol/l), TAR (>10 mmol/l), TBR (<3.9 mmol/l), Mean Sensor Glucose (MSG), Glucose Management Indicator (GMI), Glycemic Risk Index (GRI), glucose Range (daily), and Mean of Daily Differences (MODD) at corresponding times of day. We compared the changes in all metrics pre- and post-hospitalization using paired Student’s tests, Wilcoxon tests, and Sign tests.

**Results:**
Q-Score showed the largest effect in terms of values in T1D, and pooled (T1D T2D) subjects, indicating better sensitivity for detec- tion of an effect than TIR, TAR, MSG, GMI, GRI, and within day vari- ability (Range) (see Figure). MODD, a classic measure of stability of glucose patterns from day-to-day (one of 5 components of the Q-Score) showed the best sensitivity in evaluating changes in subjects with T1D but not T2D. TBR showed minimal changes.

**Conclusion:**
We observed consistent differences in sensitivity for detection of the effects of interventions, with Q-Score being superior to 7 alternatives. This study needs replication using multiple patient populations and several types of interventions to evaluate its general- izability and applicability to randomized control trials and real-world data involving multiple therapeutic interventions, including AID and pharmacotherapy.

**From metrics to behaviour: regional variations in hypoglycaemia impact among type 1 patients using CGM and AID**

J. Lee

**Background and aims:**
Hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose below 70 mg/dL, remains a common challenge for people with Type 1 diabetes (T1s). Patient populations are often segmented by health metrics like A1c and BMI to assess risk and guide care. However, the widespread use of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and auto- mated insulin delivery (AID) systems has introduced new behavioral factors that may influence outcomes beyond these traditional indica- tors. While the clinical benefits of these technologies are established, less is known about how real world use relates to hypoglycemia burden. This study examines how health metrics and technology engagement relate to hypoglycemia impact among T1s in the US and EU, with attention to regional differences in patient experience.

**Materials and methods:**
In 2024, T1s in the US (n=2,384) and the EU (n=1,461) completed an online survey in which they reported their BMI, A1c, and use of CGMs (US n=2,164, EU n=953) and AID systems (US n=1,583, EU n=648). CGM users indicated how frequently they checked their time-in-range (TIR), ranging from “rarely” to “frequently.” Similarly, AID users were asked how often they reviewed their system’s response following a perceived change in blood glucose levels, ranging from “never” to “every time.” Respondents also described the frequency with which they expe- rienced mild and moderate hypoglycemia episodes, from “almost never” to “daily.” T1s were categorized as highly impacted by hypo- glycemia if they experienced near-daily mild and weekly moder- ate events, and as rarely impacted if they almost never experienced either. Within-region comparisons were tested at a 95% confidence level, with significant differences reported.

**Results:**
Across both regions, individuals with an A1c ≤7 more often reported being highly impacted by hypoglycemia compared to those with an A1c >7 (US: 21% vs 15%; EU: 26% vs 17%). Similarly, those with a BMI <30 reported higher impact compared to individuals with a BMI ≥30 (US: 22% vs 11%; EU: 24% vs 15%). However, among US CGM users, a higher proportion of frequent TIR checkers reported being highly impacted by hypoglycemia compared to infrequent check- ers (24% vs 12%). In contrast, in the EU, frequent TIR checkers were more likely to report being rarely impacted than those who checked less often (45% vs 34%). Active AID system reviewers (“often” or “every time”) in the US were observed to be more highly impacted by hypoglycemia compared to passive (“never” to “sometimes”) reviewers (21% vs 16%). Yet, in the EU, the impact of hypoglycemia was similar regardless of AID system interaction.

**Conclusion:**
In comparing trends in the impact of hypoglycemia across T1s in the US and the EU, similar patterns emerged when segment- ing by health metrics, but diverging trends appeared with respect to diabetes technology use. In the US, individuals who engaged more frequently with their devices—such as checking their TIR or review- ing their AID system—were more likely to report higher hypoglyce- mia impact than those with less frequent interaction. In contrast, EU respondents who frequently checked their TIR tended to report fewer hypoglycemic events, while AID system engagement had minimal effect. This underscores the complexity of diabetes management; while health metrics suggest comparable outcomes across regions, patient behavior in technology use reveal regional distinctions. These differ- ences may reflect cultural or systemic factors that shape how tools are utilized, pointing to the need for further investigation and regionally tailored strategies.

**Background and aims:**
The glycemia risk index (GRI) is a novel composite score to evaluate the quality of glucose monitoring profiles, weighted according to the risk of both hypo- and hyperglycemia. Aim of this multicentric, retrospective study was to investigate the relation- ship between GRI and the most common sensor-derived glucose met- rics in a population in multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy and with ­2 generation intermittently-scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) sensors in a real-world setting.

**Materials and methods:**
The analysis included 90-day intervals from 539 routine visits of 367 patients (M/F=203/164; mean±SD: age 42±16 years, diabetes duration 21±14 years, HbA1c 7.5±1.0%) with type 1 diabetes (T1D), in MDI therapy and with isCGM sensors, who attended the outpatient diabetes clinics at the Hospitals of Verona (from January 2023 to December 2023) and Bergamo (from January 2023 to April 2023). Patients’ 90-day-long isCGM tracings were stratified into three groups based on time in range (TIR) (groups 1 to 3: >70%, 70 to 50% and ≤50%, respectively) and then in subgroups according to clinical guideline-based thresholds for time below range (TBR) (<4% vs ≥4%). GRI was computed for each subgroup and correlation and regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between GRI and the main metrics.

**Results:**
Pairwise comparisons between TIR-based groups showed sig- nificantly higher GRI as TIR decreased among groups (all p<0.001); after further stratifications based on TBR thresholds within TIR groups 1 and 2, the subgroups with TBR≥4% vs <4% displayed significantly higher GRI (31.0±8.4 vs 19.8±6.9 and 51.7±9.7 vs 43.7±8.4 for groups 1 and 2, respectively, both p<0.001), although without any significant differences in TIR (79.0±5.8% vs 80.4±7.0%, p 0.289, and 60.6±5.6% vs 59.6±5.8%, p 0.221, for groups 1 and 2, respec- tively). Pearson’s correlations and unadjusted linear regression analyses showed negative relationships between GRI and TIR and positive ones with time above range (TAR) and the coefficient of variation (CV) (all p<0.001), but none with TBR; however, when adjusted for TIR and CV, regression analyses unveiled significant opposite associations of GRI with TAR and TBR (coeff. -1.28 and 1.28, respectively, both p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
This real-world, retrospective analysis suggested that GRI may be useful for identifying patients at higher risk of hypoglycemia within groups with similar TIR. Further studies are needed, particularly in patients with different combinations of sensors and insulin admin- istration methods.

**Background and aims:**
Despite advances in diabetes technology, nocturnal hypoglycemia remains a significant clinical challenge with potentially life-threatening consequences. We aimed to develop a clini- cally actionable, personalized risk stratification tool that identifies patient-specific glycemic signatures predictive of nocturnal hypogly- cemia, enabling targeted preventative interventions.

**Materials and methods:**
We prospectively collected 1,072 patient- days of CGM data from 134 patients with diabetes (78 T1D, 56 T2D) over 12 weeks. Our novel analytical approach identified previ- ously unrecognized "glycemic signatures" by extracting 42 features from 6-hour pre-sleep glucose profiles. We developed an explainable machine learning algorithm that generates individualized risk pro- files. The model was validated through a stratified 5-fold cross-val- idation protocol with prospective testing on an independent cohort.

**Results:**
Our algorithm identified four distinct patient-specific gly- cemic signatures highly predictive of nocturnal hypoglycemia: (1) rapid glucose descent patterns (>2 mg/dL/min) with sensitivity 91%; (2) post-prandial glucose variability (CV>28%) with sensitivity 86%; (3) prolonged time below range (>5% TBR) in afternoon hours with sensitivity 87%; and (4) basal oscillation patterns with sensitivity 82%. These signatures were independent of conventional risk fac- tors and maintained predictive value across age groups and diabetes types. Clinical implementation in a pilot group (n=42) reduced noc- turnal hypoglycemic events by 62% (p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
This study introduces the novel concept of personal- ized glycemic signatures that predict nocturnal hypoglycemia with high specificity. Unlike previous approaches, our method provides actionable clinical insights by identifying patient-specific risk pat- terns, enabling targeted interventions. The significant reduction in hypoglycemic events during pilot implementation demonstrates real-world clinical utility for improving nocturnal safety in diverse diabetes populations.

**Background and aims:**
The ‘dead-in-bed’ syndrome is thought to be a consequence of hypoglycaemia induced QTc prolongation in type 1 diabetes. Thus, we characterized electrocardiogram (ECG) changes during hypoglycaemia in healthy, free-living type 1 diabetes patients.

**Materials and methods:**
A cohort of n=23 type 1 diabetes patients wore continuous subcutaneous glucose and ECG monitors for ~7 days. We compared the frequency of ventricular premature beats (VPBs), the mean and SD of heart rate and ECG intervals during hypoglycaemic and their respective control episodes (n=226 episodes, n=1,697,205 beats) using linear mixed models.

**Results:**
The mean duration of hypoglycaemic episodes was 159 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 128-192) minutes during the night and 66 (95%CI: 57-75) minutes during the day. No difference in any of the investigated parameters were found between hypoglycaemic and con- trol episodes during the day as well as in the frequency of night-time VPBs. In contrast, mean corrected QT (QTc) (mean difference (MD): 5, 95%CI: 2-9 ms) and the SDs of RR (MD: 17, 95%CI: 4-31), P-wave (MD: 2, 95%CI: 0-4), PQ (MD: 3, 95%CI: 1-6), QT (MD: 4, 95%CI: 2-7), and QTc intervals (MD: 5, 95%CI: 2-8) increased during night- time hypoglycaemia.

**Conclusion:**
Daytime hypoglycaemia is an unlikely cause of malignant arrhythmias in healthy type 1 diabetes patients. The minimal increase of QTc interval by itself does not suggest an increased risk of malignant arrhythmias. The increase in the mean of QTc together with an increase in its SD during night-time hypoglycaemia are compatible with the extremely rare occurrence of the ‘dead-in-bed’ syndrome.

**Background and aims:**
People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experi- ence 2-3 hypoglycaemic events per week on average. Frequent hypo- glycaemic episodes have been associated with a twofold increase in cardiovascular events independent of other risk factors and despite good glycaemic control. The underlying mechanisms driving this elevated risk remain largely unknown. We investigated the impact of both real-life and experimental hypoglycaemia on circulating car- diovascular markers in people with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Participants with T1D (n=25) underwent a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp (2.8 ± 0.1 mmol/l) for 60 minutes. At euglycaemia and 1 day after the clamp, plasma was collected to measure 276 cardiovascular markers using the Olink proteomics platform. For one week prior to the clamp, glucose levels were monitored using a Freestyle Libre 1 to assess frequency and duration of real-life level 1 and level 2 hypoglycae- mia and time below range (TBR). To assess the impact of real-life hypoglycaemia on cardiovascular markers, weighted correlation network analysis was performed on proteomics data at euglycae- mia to construct a protein similarity network. Correlations between protein clusters and CGM data were calculated using Spearman’s correlation. To study the effect of experimental hypoglycaemia on cardiovascular markers, Wilcoxon matched-paired tests were used to identify significant changes from euglycaemia to the 1-day time- point. Significance was adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR).

**Results:**
At euglycaemia, weighted correlation network analysis revealed 5 clusters of proteins, of which one cluster of 58 proteins was positively correlated with duration of real-life level 1 hypoglycaemia (r= 0.62, FDR < 0.05). Pathways that were most significantly enriched in this cluster included neutrophil degranulation and interleukin and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways (FDR< 0.001). Pathways that were significantly enriched in the other clusters were, among others, diseases of metabolism, cell surface interactions at the vascular wall, extracellular matrix organization and platelet activation (all FDR< 0.05). One day after the hypoglycaemic clamp, 14 cardiovascular mark- ers significantly decreased and 23 increased (p< 0.05), of which 3 of each remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Nine of the increased cardiovascular markers were part of the 58-protein network mentioned above, two of which remained significant after cor- rection for multiple testing (FDR< 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Duration of real-life level 1 hypoglycaemia is associated with higher levels of a large number of proteins that are mainly associ- ated with inflammatory pathways, several of which were also elevated one day after a single hypoglycaemic event. These findings suggest that the link between hypoglycaemia and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases may be driven by inflammatory activation and highlight the biological impact of hypoglycaemia, even at level 1.

4. of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, Novo Nordisk Foundation

**Background and aims:**
Acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, is widely used for treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycaemia (PBH) with- out having been formally validated. It is, however, associated with com- mon side effects that compromise treatment compliance. Canagliflozin, a sodium/glucose co-transporters 1 and 2 inhibitor, has been shown to acutely reduce the rate of glucose absorption and alter postprandial incretin hormone secretion after gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). We aimed at evaluating the chronic effects of acarbose and canagliflozin on postprandial glucose handling and entero-pancreatic hormone secretion in patients with RYGB and PBH.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed a double-blinded, cross-over, clinical trial where placebo, acarbose 50mg thrice daily, and cana- gliflozin 300mg twice daily were administered for four weeks to 11 participants with a clinical diagnosis of PBH and continuous glucose monitoring documented hypoglycaemia during screening. During the last week of each intervention, participants completed a four-hour solid mixed meal test with entero-pancreatic hormone profiling.

**Results:**
Compared with placebo, both pharmacological treatments did not change fasting glucose concentrations, but reduced the magnitude of glucose excursions while postprandial glycaemic nadir was unal- tered. Acarbose reduced the postprandial insulin secretion ( <0.05). There was also a tendency for lesser GIP secretion with acarbose (-23%; =0.123). GLP-1 secretion was unaltered by both pharmaco- logical treatments. Neither treatment changed the insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR). The postprandial insulin secretion profile was unaltered by canagliflozin, but there was a tendency for an increased insulino- genic index (IGI: C-peptide divided by glucose excursion during the first 30 postprandial minutes; p = 0.067). Canagliflozin reduced free fatty acids in circulation ( <0.05).

**Conclusion:**
While both pharmacological approaches failed to raise postprandial glycaemic nadir during the meal test, they altered post- prandial glycaemic excursions and associated entero-pancreatic hor- mone dynamics and could, thus, prove relevant for PBH treatment through modulation of its pathophysiology.

5. Nottingham, Nottingham, UK, University of Leicester, Leicester,
6. UK, Department of Bariatric and Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery,

**Background and aims:**
Postprandial hyperinsulinaemic hypogly- caemia (PHH) affects up to 35% of patients after metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), impacting the quality of life and contribut- ing to recurrent weight gain. While exercise is a beneficial adjunct therapy, the potential to increase insulin sensitivity raises concerns about increasing the risk of PHH.To investigate, in people after MBS without diabetes, the effect of a single aerobic exercise bout (AEX) on time spent in hypoglycaemia (HYPO, <3.0 mmol/L) and glucose homeostasis within 24 hours post-AEX.

**Materials and methods:**
Nineteen patients, one year after MBS (mean ± SD age: 55.8 ± 11.3 years, BMI: 35.6 ± 8.2 kg/m , 16 females), participated in a randomised crossover trial (Leicestershire, UK). Participants completed two experimental conditions after a standardised breakfast: (1) prolonged sitting broken up by 30 minutes of walking AEX at 60% of ­VO peak (~ 2 hours after breakfast) and (2) prolonged sitting (CON). The primary outcome was time spent in HYPO, measured by a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) (DEX- COM G6). Secondary outcomes included the glucose and insulin responses to a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT, performed ~ 45 minutes after the intervention), self-reported food intake and physi- cal activity (accelerometry) over 24 hours. CGM data are expressed as median (IQR) and MMTT, as mean (SD).

**Results:**
Due to minimal HYPO occurrences, statistical analysis was not possible for the primary outcome. Although no differences between conditions were observed for CGM mean interstitial glucose (AEX 6.4 ± 1.0; CON 6.5 ± 0.9 mmol/L; p = 0.57) and time spent <3.9 mmol/L (AEX 0 (0.0, 0.5); CON 0 (0.0, 0.5) %; p = 0.68), the glucose coefficient of variation was lower on AEX than CON (AEX: 23.1 (20.6, 28.8); CON: 29.8 (22.1, 32.7) %; p < 0.01) suggesting improvements in glycaemic variability. For the MMTT (Table 1), dif- ferences between conditions were observed for nadir, peak, and AUC​ (p < 0.05). For insulin, only the pre-MMTT concentrations differed, with AEX showing higher concentrations (Table 1, p < 0.01). No significant differences were observed between conditions regarding dietary and physical activity patterns.

**Conclusion:**
The BariEX study showed that, contrary to the hypoth- esis, in people ≥12 months after MBS, AEX did not increase the time spent in HYPO during the first 24 hours post-intervention. Instead, it elevated glycaemia in the initial post-exercise period.

**Background and aims:**
Inpatient hypoglycaemia is associated with worse outcomes, including increased length of stay (LOS). This study aims to characterise the factors affecting LOS in diabetic inpatients with and without hypoglycaemia.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult inpatients with diabetes mellitus admitted to an acute hospital in Singapore between 2017 and 2019. Demographics, medications, bio- chemical data and capillary blood glucose (CBG) values and timings were extracted, with Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) calculated. Level 1 and level 2 hypoglycaemia were defined as CBG 3.9-3.0 and < 3.0 mmol/l. Recurrent hypoglycaemia was defined as more than one episode within 2 hours. The primary outcome was LOS. ANOVA or Chi Squared tests were used for univariate analysis. All reported ­r are Nagelkerke ­r . Negative binomial was used for multivariate regres- sion. XGBoost was used for machine learning, with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for interpretation.

**Results:**
A total of 66,651 admissions from 29,328 patients (15,848 Males) were analysed. Univariate analysis showed non-hypoglycaemia, level 1 and level 2 hypoglycaemia having significant differences in LOS of 5.4±8.0 days, 12.9±17.1, and 19.8±26.0 respectively (p < 0.001, ­r = 0.287). Stratification by recurrent hypoglycaemia for hypoglycae- mic patients also showed significant LOS difference (non-recurrent 12.53±17.2 days, recurrent 21.85± 26.22; p < 0.001, ­r = 0.097). In a multivariable negative binomial regression analysis ­(r = 0.265), level 2 hypoglycaemia had the highest adjusted individual effect on LOS (adjusted Rate Ratio (aRR) = 2.60±0.09, p<0.001), meaning that patients with level 2 episodes were expected to stay approximately 2.6 times longer than those without hypoglycaemia. Level 1 (aRR = 2.26±0.05, p<0.001) and recurrent hypoglycaemia also had strong adjusted effects (aRR = 1.48±0.05, p<0.001), whereas age, BMI and creatinine all had weak adjusted effects (aRR between 0.99 and 1.01). CCI had a positive but moderate effect on LOS (aRR = 1.09±0.009). Covariate interactions between recurrent and level 2 hypoglycaemia were significant, and in combination was associated with an increased LOS (aRR 1.16±0.09, p<0.001). This interaction was supported by machine learning, with XGBoost model showing strong interaction between recurrent and level 2 hypoglycaemia (SHAP = 0.0815). Additionally, both variables exhibited high interaction strength in a variance-based decomposition, suggesting a meaningful joint influ- ence on LOS.

**Conclusion:**
Our analysis confirms that inpatient hypoglycaemia is strongly associated with increased LOS, yet the nature of hypoglycae- mic episodes are also important variables to consider. Level 2 hypogly- caemia, as well as recurrent hypoglycaemia, are both markers of sever- ity and are both associated with increased LOS. There is also strong interaction between recurrence and level 2 hypoglycaemia, suggesting that it is important to prevent both from happening in the same patient. Taken together, these results show that severity of hypoglycaemia epi- sodes further contribute to LOS in diabetic inpatients. This suggests that clinicians should thus not only try to prevent hypoglycaemia, but also to prevent it from worsening in terms of severity and recurrence.

6. bourg, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.

**Background and aims:**
Analysis of potential changes in CGM pro- files between therapy switchers vs non-switchers and the rate of acute complications after one year of AID use.

**Materials and methods:**
Children and adolescents with type 1 diabe- tes (T1D) for > 6 months, age < 18 years, at least 1 year of AID use, and available CGM profiles (time in range (TIR), time in tight range (TiTR), time below range (TBR), coefficient of variation (CV)) were included based on data from the German/Austrian/Luxembourgian/ Swiss Diabetes Patient Follow-up Documentation (DPV registry) for the period 2019-2024. Adjusted linear, beta, and negative-binomial regression models were used to examine possible changes in metabolic control and rates of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) associated with AID. Analyses were stratified by previous therapy. Baseline was defined as 12 months before last AID documentation +/- 90 days, follow-up as last AID documentation +/- 90 days.

**Results:**
1688 subjects (median age: 12.2 years, 54.0% male and 30.9% with migration background) with a median duration of treatment with AID of 11 months were included. Before baseline, 22.5% (MDI 5.5% (n=91), CSII 17.0% (n=286)) had changed therapy, 77,5% (n=1301) were already using an AID system. CGM metrics showed significant differences in CV: while CV slightly increased in switchers (BL 34.1 [95%-CI: 33.6-34.6] to FU 34.3 [33.8-34.8]), it slightly decreased in non-switchers (BL 33.7 [33.4-33.9] to FU 33.2 [32.9-33.5]). No significant differences were observed regarding TIR, TiTR and TBR. HbA1c changes also differed significantly between switchers and non- switchers: HbA1c decreased in switcher but slightly increased in non- switchers (BL 7.37 [7.26-7.47] to FU 7.30 [7.20-7.40] vs. BL 7.24 [7.19-7.30], to 7.29 [7.23-7.35]. The change in rate of severe hypo- glycemia differed strongly between the two groups, with an increase in switchers and a decrease in non-switchers (BL 1.4/100 person-year (PY)J [0.9-2.2] to FU 2.3/100 PY [1.5-3.4] vs. BL 3.5/100 PY [2.9-4.3] to 1.5 /100 PY [1.1-2.0]). Significant differences were also seen for DKA, with an increase in switchers and a decrease in non-switchers (BL 0.7 /100 PY [0.4-1.1] to FU 3.0 /100 PY [2.4-3.8] vs. 2.2 /100 PY [2.0-2.5] to 0.6 /100 PY [0.5-0.8]).

**Conclusion:**
After one year, AID therapy switchers showed a slight benefit in HbA1c. However, no significant changes were observed for TiTR, TIR and TBR over time. The first year of AID use didn’t have a favorable effect on severe hypoglycemia and DKA, but continuous AID use was associated with a decrease in both acute complications. Training in AID use should be evaluated to identify knowledge gaps from the outset.

**Background and aims:**
Hybrid closed loop (HCL) systems are now considered the standard of care for type 1 diabetes (T1D), recently endorsed for widescale adoption in England. We aimed to compare glycaemic control across commercially available HCL systems using real-world data from adults with T1D in the United Kingdom.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective single-centre observational study. Adults with T1D onboarded onto HCL from March 2021 to March 2024 were included. Glycaemic outcomes and insulin delivery data three months post-HCL are reported as mean ± standard deviation unless stated otherwise.

**Results:**
Data from 298 individuals (Female 61%, n=181; age 38 IQR [30, 50]) were included in analysis and detailed in table 1.Across the total cohort, one-third of individuals attained international consensus time-in-range (TIR) targets post HCL, with the likelihood of attain- ing targets not associated with HCL system (p=0.058). Hba1c/GMI targets of 7% were attained in 38% and associated with HCL system (p=0.017). Post-HCL TIR was negatively correlated with active insulin time (AIT) (R=-0.352, p<0.001) and mean HCL glucose target (R=- 0.177, p=0.002).

**Conclusion:**
Our real-world data suggests that glycaemic outcomes from commercially available HCL systems are broadly comparable. However, between system comparisons may reveal individual system strengths and limitations that could inform clinical decision mak- ing. Negative correlations between post-HCL TIR with both AIT and mean glucose-target suggest that more aggressive insulin deliv- ery may improve glycaemic control. User compliance, particularly in patch pump HCL systems, may significantly impact efficacy, poten- tially offsetting algorithmic differences. Further statistical analyses on between system comparisons are ongoing. Whilst our findings have clinical implications, future research will compare pre- and post-HCL glycaemic metrics to better assess the relative efficacy of commercially available HCL systems within real-world, publicly funded healthcare settings.

**Background and aims:**
Anxiety disorders are amongst the most com- mon mental health comorbidities in type 1 diabetes (T1D) with a preva- lence of up to 40%. Hybrid closed loop (HCL) technology improves glycaemic control and quality of life for people with T1D but evidence of using HCL in people with comorbid anxiety disorders is limited. We performed a retrospective clinical audit to evaluate the outcomes of HCL in people with T1D and anxiety disorders using HCL systems at a tertiary diabetes centre.

**Materials and methods:**
Electronic patient records (EPR) were used to identify people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and any variant of anxiety disorder diagnosis. EPR records were analysed retrospectively for base- line demographics, pre- and post- HCL start glycaemic outcomes where applicable, and psychiatric parameters. Biomedical data were obtained for pre and post initiation of HCL via their continuous glucose moni- toring (CGM) and HCL cloud data sources in conjunction with EPR.

**Results:**
We identified 114 people with T1D and a co-morbid anxiety disorder (27 men, 87 women; ethnicity 62.3% white, 6.1% black, 11% mixed, 5% other; age 37.3±13.6 years; BMI 27.4±6.5 kg/m ; diabetes duration 23.2±12.7 years). Of these, 47 people had mixed anxiety/ depression, and 19 had an another additional psychiatric diagnosis. HCL was used by 63 people (9 males: 54 females; ethnicity 57.2% white, 4.8% black, 9.5% mixed, 3.2% other; age 37.1±13.0 years, BMI 28.1±4.9 kg/m , diabetes duration 24.0±12.7 years) and 51 were on multiple daily injections (MDI) (18 males:33 females; ethnicity 68.6% white, 7.8% black, 9.8% mixed, 5.9% other; age 37.5±14.4 years; BMI 26.5±7.9 kg/m ; diabetes duration 22.5±12.7 years). HCL users showed a reduction of glycated haemoglobin A1c ­(HbA ) from 70.49±18.61 mmol/mol to 61.92±14.46 mmol/mol, and significant improvement in time in range (TIR: defined as 3.9 - 10 mmol/L (70 - 180mg/dL)) from 41.10±18.56% to 60.35±17.16% (both p<0.001) after HCL initiation. Most recent ­HbA was 13.33±3.65 mmol/mol lower and TIR was 18.28±4.08% higher (both p<0.001) in HCL users compared to people on MDI. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) episodes occurred in 1.6% of HCL users compared to 11.8% of MDI users, and severe hypoglycaemic episodes in 14.3% of HCL users compared to 13.7% of MDI users in the preceding 12 months. Sub-analysis by indi- ces of multiple deprivation (IMD) in HCL users showed no significant difference.

**Conclusion:**
Use of HCL demonstrated a clear improvement in glycae- mic parameters such as ­HbA and TIR in people with T1D and comor- bid anxiety disorders. Benefits are observed not only in people before and after therapeutic start, but compared with people on MDI or open loop insulin therapy. Deprivation indices appear to have no significant impact on HCL related outcomes in people with anxiety. Overall, these real-world data support the use of HCL in people with co-morbid anxi- ety disorder in a multidisciplinary care setting. Qualitative studies and clinical trials will be needed to provide further evidence of the impact of HCL on mental health and biomedical outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Currently available automated insulin delivery systems (AID) are hybrid closed loop systems that require manual insu- lin boluses for meals, a burden for users. In adults with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) the CLOSE IT trial investigated a fully closed loop (FCL) AID system using the open-source oref1 algorithm which eliminates need for meal announcements. This extension study aimed to compare the performance of rapid (insulin aspart) and ultra-rapid insulin (insulin aspart + niacinamide) in an FCL system.

**Materials and methods:**
A single-arm pre-post study nested in an open-label, parallel, non-inferiority trial evaluating an open-source automated insulin delivery system in 73 adults with T1D. Twenty par- ticipants used the FCL oref1 system with rapid insulin for 12 weeks before switching to ultra-rapid insulin for a further 4 weeks. The pri- mary outcome was the percent time in range (TIR) (70-180 mg/dL [3.9-10.0 mmol/L]) during the final two weeks of each phase. Second- ary outcomes included mean glucose levels, glucose variability, time in tight range (TITR) (70-140 mg/dL [3.9-7.8 mmol/L]) , time below range (TBR) (<70mg/dL [<3.9mmol/L]), and time above range (TAR) (>180mg/dL [>10.0mmol/L]).

**Results:**
Twenty participants (60% male, median age 36 [IQR 29-52], duration of T1D 20 years [11-25]) transitioned from rapid to ultra-rapid insulin. The (mean±SD) TIR changed from 65±10% to 68±10%, a mean increase of 3.0% (95% confidence interval -0.04, 6.0, p=0.053). Mean glucose was similar between treatments (fig 1) (9±0.9 mmol/l vs 8.8±1.0, mean change -3.5 [-10, 3.0] p=0.3). TBR (0.25±0.29% vs 0.27±0.33% mean change = 0.01 [-0.13, 0.16] p= 0.8) and TAR (33±10% vs 30±11% mean change = -3.1 [-6.5, 0.39] p= 0.079) were comparable. TITR changed from 43±9% to 47±11%, a mean difference of 3.6 [-0.28, 7.4]%, p=0.067. No significant differences were observed in the Glucose Management Indicator (7.2±0.4% vs 7.1±0.4%, mean change -0.08% [-0.24, 0.07] p =0.3) or coefficient of variation (37.4%±3.5 vs 37.1% ±5.0, mean change = -0.27 [-1.8, 1.3] p=0.7). There were no severe hypoglycaemia or DKA events.

**Conclusion:**
There were small differences in glucose metrics between rapid and ultra-rapid insulin aspart in an FCL system using the oref1 algorithm, but these did not reach statistical significance. Safety was comparable. Larger studies would be more likely to detect smaller dif- ferences in glucose metrics.

**Hybrid closed loop in diabetes after total duodeno-pancreatectomy**

A. Larroumet, sard, K. Mohammedi

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes secondary to total pancreaticodu- odenectomy (TP) is associated with poor glycemic control and an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. Although it is not a standard treatment of pancreatic diabetes, data suggest that hybrid closed-loop (HCL) could improve metabolic control in patients with pancreatogenic diabetes. Earlier, we have reported four cases of successful treatment with HCL in the early post-operative phase. We report here preliminary data of the effect HCL on glucose management in 23 patients who have undergone pancreatic resection.

**Materials and methods:**
Twenthy-three patients underwent TP and were agreed to use HCL instead of standard treatment of multiple daily injections and CGM. Seven used Minimed 780 Smartguard, 3 Ypsopump-CAMAPS FX and 13 Omnipod 5 Smartadjust, according to their preference. HCL was initiated in hospital setting in the Diabe- tology Department of a University Hospital Centre, and patients were discharged with ambulatory follow-up at 30 days and 90 days. We assessed the changes in HbA1c, Glucose Management Indicator (GMI), Time In Range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dL), Time Below Range (TBR, <70 mg/dL), and Coefficient of Variation (CV) from before HCL initiation to 90 days and to the latest available data.

**Results:**
Our 23 patients were 12 females (52%) and 11 males (48%), aged 69.5±9.3 years (median age 71 years old). Sixteen patients (49%) had no diabetes prior to surgery. HCL was initiated within 3 month of surgery for 11 patients (48%), between 3 month and a year after surgery for 6 patients (26%) and over a year after surgery for 6 (26%). Five patients had a history of severe hypoglycemia requiring medical intervention before HCL initiation (one between 3 month and a year after surgery and 4 over a year after surgery).Median follow up was 131 days (mean 175.6±125 days). At baseline, HbA1c was 6.9±1.2% ; GMI 7.9±0.9% ; TIR 53.2±17.4 ; TBR 1.8±2.5% ; Time above range (TAR) 180-250 mg/dl 24.7±7,8% ; TAR > 250 mg/dl 22.3±14.5. CV was 38.1±5.3. At 90 days, HbA1c was 6.9±0.6% ; GMI 7±0.3% ; TIR 72.5±8.5% ; TBR 1.3±1.2% ; TAR 180-250 mg/dl 21±6.4% ; TAR > 250 mg/dl 5.2±3.3%. CV 34.1±6.6%. At the latest evaluation, HbA1c was 7±0.5% ; GMI 7±0.3% ; TIR 72.9±8% ; TBR 1±0.9% ; TAR 180- 250 mg/dl 21.3±7.2% ; TAR > 250 mg/dl 4.8±2.6% ; CV 32.8±4.6%. None of the patients experienced severe hypoglycemia episode or need for unplanned medical contact after HCL.

**Conclusion:**
HCL used after total pancreatectomy allowed a safe and sustained glycemic control after TP. A randomized control trial is nec- essary to confirm these findings, however they open an interesting path- way in the management of pancreatogenic diabetes as TP is becoming a more frequent surgery. Long-term follow-up of these patients will be necessary to confirm efficacy and the safety of HCL, as it concerns a frailer and older population than patients with Type 1 Diabetes who use this technology.

6. USA, Insulet Corporation, Acton, MA, USA.

**Background and aims:**
A recent trial of the Omnipod® 5 Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) System showed improvement in glycemic outcomes following AID initiation in a cohort of adults with insulin- treated type 2 diabetes (T2D) and was subsequently cleared by the US FDA for use in this population (also FDA cleared/CE marked for ages ≥2y with type 1 diabetes). However, limited real-world data exist on AID use and bolus behaviors in this population. This analysis evaluated real-world outcomes with Omnipod 5 use in the management of T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective analysis of CGM and insulin data from Omnipod 5 users with T2D in the US aged ≥18y with suf- ficient CGM data (≥90 days of data, ≥75% of days with ≥220 readings) was conducted for those who self-reported baseline HbA1c and primar- ily used the 110 or 120 mg/dL (6.1 or 6.7 mmol/L) targets. Outcomes were stratified by baseline HbA1c and bolus frequency.

**Results:**
A total of 14,517 users (median age 59y; prior therapy: 50% MDI) met the inclusion criteria. Users had spent a median of one year on device at the time of analysis, with 94% of time in Automated Mode. Percent time in target range (70-180 mg/dL; 3.9-10.0 mmol/L) and glucose management indicator by baseline HbA1c and bolus frequency are shown in the Figure. Among these users, time <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) was low (median 0.27%).

**Conclusion:**
These findings from a large-scale real-world dataset of long-term (~1 year) AID use are similar to those reported in the pivotal trial of Omnipod 5 in T2D and provide evidence that people with T2D requiring insulin can consistently use AID long-term and achieve glycemic benefits even with elevated baseline HbA1c.

1. University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy, Medtronic, Tolochenaz,

**Background and aims:**
The MiniMed 780G (MM780G) Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop (AHCL) System is currently indicated for peo- ple with type 1 diabetes but not with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we present 12-month longitudinal real-world data of MM780G users with self-reported T2D and high total daily insulin dose (TDD).

**Materials and methods:**
Anonymized worldwide CareLink data from January 2020 to January 2025 were used. We extracted data from MM780G users with self-reported T2D and average TDD >100 units, who had ≥10 days of CGM data in each month after AHCL initiation. Glucose and insulin metrics were calculated for each month over a 12-month period. Informed consent for use of data was obtained.

**Results:**
In total, 430 users were included. Results are shown in the Figure. Over 12 months, the mean TIR was consistently in the range between 75.1% to 76.5%, and the mean TITR between 45.2% to 47.3%. Time below 70 mg/dL consistently remained ≤0.3%. Use of recommended optimal settings (i.e., Glucose Target of 100 mg/ dl and Active Insulin Time of 2 hours for >95% of the time) ranged from 39% at month 1 to 47% at month 12. Time using auto mode remained >91% throughout the whole period of observation (panel A). Insulin metrics remained unchanged over time (panel B), with ~70% of the TDD delivered by automation.

**Conclusion:**
Real-world data shows that MM780G users with T2D on average achieve the international glycemic targets and maintain stable glycemic control and insulin doses over a 12-month period.

**Cost-effectiveness of AID use in individuals with diabetes across different patient groups in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Fin-**

**Background and aims:**
Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have revolutionized diabetes therapy: improving glucose levels while tremendously simplifying diabetes management for people living with diabetes. With AID uptake rapidly increasing, there is a need to assess the viability of widespread adoption for health care systems. This health economics study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the clinical and economic impact of AID across various patient groups in the Nordic region.

**Materials and methods:**
We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of AID versus MDI+CGM over a 30 years’ time horizon. IQVIA Core Dia- betes Model v.10 was used to simulate different patient cohorts based on published literature and country-specific cost data. The different patient groups analyzed were: children and youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D), adults with T1D, and adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Base- line HbA1c with MDI+CGM was: 7.9% for T1D children and youth, 9.0% for adults with T1D, and 9.1% for adults with T2D. Based on the selected studies, the following AID-attributable HbA1c reductions were applied: 0.7%, 1.4% and 1.3% respectively.

**Results:**
Quality adjusted life years (QALY) gains were observed in all AID groups: 1.4 for children and youth with T1D, 1.5 for adults with T1D and 0.8 for adults with T2D. Reduced diabetes-related complica- tions were observed in all groups; in T1D pediatrics 34% [SD: 1.9%], in T1D adults 48% [SD: 1.1%], in T2D adults 23% [SD:2.3%]. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is used to assess cost-effectiveness, remained below all the country-specific willingness- to-pay (WTP) thresholds for all groups (Figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
The use of AID systems leads to both short- and long- term clinical benefits alongside with reduced economic impact. In the Nordic region, AID has been shown to be a cost-effective therapy across all analyzed patient groups. These findings highlight the impor- tance of appropriate budget allocation for diabetes technologies, which in turn contribute to reduced healthcare resources utilization. Expand- ing access to AID systems in the Nordics could provide significant benefits for patients, healthcare systems, and society as a whole.

**Background and aims:**
IcoSema (a once-weekly combination therapy of insulin icodec [icodec] and semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue) has been investigated in three 52-week, phase 3a trials (COMBINE 1-3). Here, we assessed the treatment effects of IcoSema vs comparators by pre-trial sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) use in COMBINE 1-3.

**Materials and methods:**
In the COMBINE trials, adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were randomised 1:1 to IcoSema or once-weekly icodec (COMBINE 1), once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg (COMBINE 2), or basal-bolus therapy (insulin glargine U100 + insulin aspart; COM- BINE 3). Participants who were receiving SGLT2is before randomi- sation were recommended to continue their pre-trial SGLT2is at the same dose and dosing frequency throughout the trial. In this post hoc analysis, efficacy and hypoglycaemia outcomes were assessed, by trial, according to pre-trial SGLT2i use.

**Results:**
Of the 2653 participants in COMBINE 1-3, 1063 (40.1%) were treated with an SGLT2i at screening. Across all trials, change in ­HbA from baseline to week 52 with IcoSema vs comparators was consistent regardless of pre-trial SGLT2i use; no statistically signifi- cant treatment by subgroup interaction in change in ­HbA was seen (Figure). Rates of clinically significant or severe hypoglycaemia were lower (COMBINE 1 & 3) or similar (COMBINE 2) with IcoSema vs comparators irrespective of SGLT2i usage, with no statistically signifi- cant treatment by subgroup interaction observed ( >0.05 for all trials). The proportion of participants achieving ­HbA <7% at end of treat- ment without weight gain and without clinically significant or severe hypoglycaemia was consistent irrespective of pre-trial SGLT2i usage ( ≥0.13 for all trials). In COMBINE 1, a statistically significant treat- ment by subgroup interaction was seen for mean weekly total insulin dose at week 50-52 ( =0.0052); overall, the mean insulin dose was lower with IcoSema vs icodec, with a larger difference in insulin dose between arms in SGLT2i users vs non-users. A statistically significant treatment by subgroup interaction for change in body weight from baseline to week 52 was seen in COMBINE 1 ( =0.0030) and COM- BINE 3 ( =0.0116); weight decreased with IcoSema and increased with comparators, with larger differences in weight change between arms in SGLT2i users vs non-users.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, efficacy and hypoglycaemia outcomes were gen- erally consistent with IcoSema vs comparators among adults with T2D, irrespective of pre-trial SGLT2i use.

**Background and aims:**
IcoSema is a once-weekly combination ther- apy of basal insulin icodec (icodec) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue semaglutide. This post hoc analysis assessed continuous glu- cose monitoring (CGM) outcomes with IcoSema vs comparators using blinded CGM data from two 52-week, phase 3a trials (COMBINE 1, 3) in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

**Materials and methods:**
Adults with T2D inadequately controlled on basal insulin were randomised 1:1 to IcoSema or comparator (COM- BINE 1: icodec; COMBINE 3: basal-bolus therapy [BBT], insulin glar- gine U100 + insulin aspart). CGM-based time in tight range (TiTR, 3.9-7.8 mmol/L); achievement of the composite outcome (>70% time in range + <25% time above range + <4% time <3.9 mmol/L); glycae- mic variability (CV%); and duration of overall hypoglycaemic episodes (<3.9 mmol/L for ≥15 consecutive minutes) were assessed between weeks 48-52.

**Results:**
Mean percentage of TiTR was significantly higher with IcoSema vs icodec ( <0.0001), and similar vs BBT ( =0.8912). Sig- nificantly more participants achieved the composite outcome with IcoSema vs icodec ( <0.0001) or BBT ( =0.0031). Across arms, the geometric mean of CV% was <36% and median duration of overall hypoglycaemic episodes was similar.

**Conclusion:**
Between weeks 48-52, TiTR was significantly higher with IcoSema vs icodec and similar vs BBT. More participants on IcoSema vs comparators achieved the CGM composite outcome, CV% was <36% and median overall hypoglycaemia duration was similar between arms.

**Background and aims:**
This post hoc analysis investigated whether IcoSema, a once-weekly (OW) combination therapy of basal insulin icodec and the GLP-1 analogue semaglutide currently in development, offers a postprandial glucose (PPG) control benefit vs other insulin- based regimens.

**Materials and methods:**
COMBINE 1 and 3, two 52-week, phase 3a trials, investigated IcoSema vs OW basal insulin (icodec; COMBINE 1) or basal-bolus therapy (glargine U100 + aspart; COMBINE 3) in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who were inadequately controlled on daily basal insulin. This analysis evaluated continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data (Dexcom G6) collected during weeks 48-52 of both trials. To determine the effect of IcoSema vs comparators on PPG param- eters, an algorithm based on model-derived estimates of meal intake to identify increases in PPG was used (glucose rate increase detector [GRID] algorithm).

**Results:**
Statistically significantly lower increments in PPG peak and 90-minute PPG peak were seen with IcoSema vs OW basal insulin (Table). There were no statistically significant differences in AUC​ ferences were observed in CGM-derived PPG parameters with IcoSema vs basal-bolus therapy.

**Conclusion:**
Based on post hoc modelling using CGM data, IcoSema showed statistically significantly better PPG control vs OW basal insu- lin and similar PPG control vs basal-bolus therapy.

**Background and aims:**
The efficacy and safety of IcoSema, a once- weekly combination therapy of basal insulin icodec and semaglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] analogue), were assessed in three 52-week, phase 3a trials (COMBINE 1-3). This post hoc analysis eval- uated whether gastrointestinal adverse events (GIAEs) in the IcoSema arms of COMBINE 1-3 affected key efficacy outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
In the COMBINE trials, adults with inad- equately controlled type 2 diabetes on daily basal insulin (COMBINE 1 and 3) or a GLP-1 receptor agonist (COMBINE 2) were randomised 1:1 to IcoSema or a comparator. Here, we evaluated changes in ­HbA and body weight from baseline to week 52, and the actual weekly insulin dose over the treatment period in participants receiving IcoSema with or without GIAEs (nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting).

**Results:**
In the IcoSema arms of the COMBINE trials, nausea, diar- rhoea and vomiting were the most commonly reported GIAEs, expe- rienced by 221 (34.3%) and 101 (29.7%) participants in COMBINE 1 and 3, respectively, and by 72 (21.1%) participants in COMBINE 2; most events were mild or moderate in severity and reported as recov- ered or resolved. In all trials, ­HbA levels decreased from baseline to week 52 regardless of experiencing GIAEs (Figure panel A). For each trial, the mean actual weekly insulin doses over time from baseline to week 52 were generally comparable, irrespective of GIAE occurrence (Figure panel B). Mean (SD) changes in body weight from baseline to week 52 were: −4.56 (4.75) kg with and −3.46 (4.91) kg without GIAEs in COMBINE 1; −3.74 (5.13) kg with and −3.63 (4.68) kg without GIAEs in COMBINE 3; and −0.14 (5.01) kg with and 1.22 (4.13) kg without GIAEs in COMBINE 2.

**Conclusion:**
In participants receiving IcoSema, regardless of expe- riencing GIAEs, changes in ­HbA , body weight and actual weekly insulin dose over the treatment period, were broadly consistent with the overall findings reported for the COMBINE trials.

**Improved treatment satisfaction with once-weekly IcoSema vs daily basal-bolus therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on daily basal insulin: COMBINE 3**

**Background and aims:**
COMBINE 3 evaluated the efficacy and safety of IcoSema, a once-weekly combination of basal insulin icodec and the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue semaglutide, vs daily basal-bolus therapy (BBT) in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). At week 52, the increase from baseline in the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Question- naire - status version (DTSQs) total treatment satisfaction score was statistically significantly greater with IcoSema vs daily BBT (estimated change from baseline: +4.47 vs +1.40; estimated treatment difference [95% CI]: 3.06 [2.04; 4.09], <0.0001). Here, we report changes in the individual DTSQs item scores.

**Materials and methods:**
In COMBINE 3, a 52-week, open-label, treat-to-target, phase 3a trial, adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with T2D ­(HbA : 7.0-10.0%) receiving daily basal insulin (20-80 U/day) were randomised 1:1 to once-weekly IcoSema (n=340) or daily BBT (glar- gine U100 + aspart; n=339). Participants completed the DTSQs at baseline and week 52.

**Results:**
At week 52, statistically significantly greater increases from baseline were reported with IcoSema vs daily BBT on the fol- lowing DTSQs items: participants’ satisfaction with current treat- ment, convenience, flexibility, participants’ willingness to recom- mend treatment to others and satisfaction to continue trial treatment ( <0.0001 for all; Figure A). There were statistically significant reductions with IcoSema vs daily BBT in the perception of hav- ing unacceptable hyperglycaemia ( =0.0001) and hypoglycaemia ( <0.0001). The estimated odds of achieving a clinical meaningful improvement (>0.5 SD increase from baseline) in the DTSQs total treatment satisfaction score as well as the following DTSQs items - treatment convenience, flexibility, willingness to recommend treat- ment to others and satisfaction to continue trial treatment- were all statistically significantly greater with IcoSema vs daily BBT ( <0.05 for all; Figure B). For IcoSema vs daily BBT, there were statistically significantly higher estimated odds of achieving a clinically mean- ingful reduction (>0.5 SD decrease from baseline) in the perception of having unacceptable hyperglycaemia ( <0.0001) and hypogly- caemia ( <0.0001).

**Conclusion:**
The statistically significant estimated improvement in the total treatment satisfaction score with once-weekly IcoSema vs daily BBT appeared to be driven by satisfaction with current treatment, con- venience, flexibility, willingness to recommend treatment to others and satisfaction to continue trial treatment.

**Comparative effectiveness of GLP-1 RA-insulin combination vs insulin-only intensive therapy for hospitalised type 2 diabetes patients**

Y. Lu

**Background and aims:**
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Intensive Insulin Therapy (IIT) versus intensive insulin therapy plus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) on glycemic con- trol in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Furthermore, the effects of different initiation time of GLP-1 RA on insulin dose adjustment and blood glucose target time were further explored to optimize the blood glucose management strategy of hos- pitalized patients.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 368 patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to the Department of Endocrinology of our Hospital from January to August 2023 were enrolled. According to the treatment regimen, they were divided into combination group (IIT+GLP-1 RA, n=103) and intensive group (IIT alone, n=265). Baseline data (glyco- sylated hemoglobin A1c, duration of diabetes, height, weight, and age) were comparable between the two groups after adjustment for non- parametric tests. Glycemic control indicators included: ① final dose of intensive insulin regimen; ② The time of glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] < 7.0 mmol/L and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose [PPG] < 10.0 mmol/L); ③ FPG and PPG levels after treatment. Patients in the combination group were further divided into the early (first third of hospitalization time), middle (middle third of hospitaliza- tion time) and late (last third of hospitalization time) according to the time of GLP-1 RA added at the time of hospitalization, and the effect of starting time on the efficacy was analyzed.

**Results:**
Comparison of efficacy: The total insulin dosage [29.0 (24- 44) U vs 32 (23.5-42) U, P=0.035] and the time to reach the target blood glucose [4 (3-6) days vs 5 (4-7) days, P=0.01] in the combined group were significantly lower than those in the intensive group. The 2-hour postprandial blood glucose control was better [8.28 (7.33-9.64) mmol/L vs.9 (7.75-10.60) mmol/L, P < 0.001]. Analysis of the initia- tion time: the medium-term initiation group had a significant reduction in insulin dose (6U less than that of the early group), and the shortest time to reach the blood glucose target (4 days), which may be related to the synergistic effect of GLP-1 RA after the gradual remission of insulin resistance.

**Conclusion:**
Intensive insulin therapy combined with GLP-1 RA can reduce insulin requirement and accelerate blood glucose control in hospitalized patients with T2DM, and the mid-term initiation of GLP-1 RA may be the best time window to maximize the hypoglycemic effect.

**Background and aims:**
The EF-BI study, a nationwide retrospective study in France, compared total care costs of initiating Gla-300 vs. Gla- 100 in T2DM patients. It showed better persistence, fewer acute events, and lower costs with Gla-300 over three years. However, benefits may vary by patient characteristics. This post-hoc analysis assessed out- comes by age group.

**Materials and methods:**
This study was conducted using the national French healthcare claims database (SNDS). Adult living with T2DM who initiated a basal insulin scheme with Gla-300 or Gla-100±other diabetes treatment between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, and without insulin therapy in the previous 6 months were included. A propensity score on initial patient/treatment characteristics was used to perform an adjusted comparison of total costs of patients treated continuously with basal insulin over one to three years after initia- tion. Two age groups were considered with cut-off at 75 years. Costs included all-cause health expenditures (inpatient and outpatient care) either reimbursed or not by the national Sickness fund.

**Results:**
A total of 175,556 patients were included, with 47,228 exposed to Gla-100 and 13,021 to Gla-300 respectively during the three-year period following initiation. Treatment adherence was assessed, showing that patients treated with Gla-300 were 41% (HR 0.587 [0.565-0.610], p<0.0001) and 45% (HR 0.553 [0.537-0.569], p<0.0001) less likely to discontinue treatment than those treated with Gla-100 in the ≥75 years and <75 years subgroups, respectively. Over the study period, overall hospitalized acute events possibly related to insulin therapy were less frequent with Gla-300 in both subgroups (≥75 years: HR 0.90 [0.85-0.95], p=0.0002; <75 years: HR 0.81 [0.74-0.89], p<0.0001). After adjustment, the comparisons of costs per patient over the three-year period showed moderate but statisti- cally significant results in favor of Gla-300 compared to Gla-100 in both subgroups. The cost reduction with Gla-300 was -€2,626 (-6.3%, p<0.0001) in patients ≥75 years, and -€2,554 in patients <75 years (-7.9%, p<0.0001). The cost reduction vs Gla-100 was higher during the first year after initiation in both subgroups: ≥75 years: -€1,928 with Gla-300, (-13.2%, p<0.0001) and <75 years: -€1,980 with Gla-300, (-16.5%, p<0.0001). Similar results were obtained by using other age cut-off at 65 and 80 years.

**Conclusion:**
The results of this EF-BI post-hoc analysis suggests that overall costs, treatment adherence, and hospitalized acute events possi- bly related to insulin therapy favor Gla-300 over Gla-100 in the T2DM population in France, regardless of age.

**A breakthrough in hypoglycaemia management: demonstrating the efficacy and acceptability of FLO23011, a novel ketone glucose combination product in type 1 diabetes**

D. Russell-Jones, F. Shojaee-Moradie

1. University of Surrey, Guildford, UK, Royal Surrey NHS Foundation
3. Trust, Guildford, UK, applied strategic, London, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Hypoglycaemia is a common, potentially dan- gerous complication of diabetes medication. Current treatments raise blood glucose but have limitations: rapid glucose fluctuations ("peak and crash"), suboptimal cognitive recovery and fatigue. The brain can use intermediary metabolites (ketones, lactate, pyruvate) in addition to glucose. This study evaluated effectiveness and acceptability of FLO23011, a novel combination product containing glucose and other brain energy sources, versus standard of care (SoC) glucose gel.

**Materials and methods:**
2 studies were performed: (A) pharmacoki- netics study in healthy subjects; (B) clinical trial in subjects with type 1 diabetes. (A): Six adults (3 M/3 F; mean age 46.5; BMI 24.7) received FLO23011 1-dose (1-FLO), 2-dose (2-FLO) or SoC after overnight fasts. 1-FLO and SoC were dose-matched for glucose. Blood samples were collected for 3 hours. (B): Twelve adults with type 1 diabetes used FLO23011 or SoC in random order over 12 weeks to treat hypogly- caemia at home. , glucose control were assessed via structured questionnaires and CGM data. Ethics approval was obtained.

**Results:**
(A): Glucose peak plasma concentrations were comparable between 1-FLO and SoC (1-FLO: 7.4 ± 0.3 mmol/L vs. SoC: 7.9 ± 0.2 mmol/L, p=0.122) as were total AUCs (1-FLO: 1292.3 ± 62.5 mmol/ L*min vs. SoC 1194.5 ± 48.6 mmol/L*min, p=0.195). FLO23011 provided a more stable energy profile: glucose declined more slowly to baseline (1-FLO: 150 min vs. SoC: <120 min), and levels of alternative energy substrates were elevated for 3 hours (Fig 1). Insulin increased in response to glucose load, with no difference between 1-FLO and SoC. Glucagon responses were similar. (B): Interim results reveal sub- jects averaged 43 episodes of hypoglycaemia over the study period, with additional low-glucose episodes treated before hypoglycaemia thresholds were met. FLO23011 was rated higher across Effective- ness/ Recovery measures (p=0.045) versus SoC, including: (p=<0.001), (p=0.025). Participants reported with FLO23011 (p=0.049). There was a trend toward increased time in tar- get range, reduced time below range with FLO23011.

**Conclusion:**
The novel product FLO23011 raises ketones and other brain energy substrates; it is a more effective, preferred option for treat- ing hypoglycaemia in diabetes, providing fast, complete recovery, and improved user experience. FLO23011 is the first new treatment option for hypoglycaemia in 100 years: its adoption may change the lives of many people with diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
We aim to profile ketone levels in free-living people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the absence of acute illness.

**Materials and methods:**
In addition to demographic, anthropometric, HbA1c and continuous glucose monitor (CGM, Abbott Freestyle Libre 2) data, interstitial ketone profiles were assessed 5-minutely with a subcutaneous continuous ketone monitor (CKM, Abbott) during a two- week run-in for the PARTNER Study where prior SGLT2 inhibitor use was an exclusion.

**Results:**
Participants (n=28) have been studied to date (Table 1). Approximately one-third (n=10, 35.7%) recorded a ketone level of ≥0.6mmol/L during the two weeks. For every 10-year increase in dia- betes duration, there was a 1.82 odd of ketones ≥0.6mmol/L (95% CI 1.06, 3.58; P=0.046). There were no statistically significant differ- ences according to age, sex, type of insulin treatment, BMI, HbA1c and average total daily insulin doses. Of the participants with ketones ≥0.6mmol/L, seven did not exceed 0.9mmol/L. Three participants had ketones 1.0-1.5 mmol/L 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.5% of the time with the high- est level recorded 1.1mmol/L. Two were female and one male, all with T1D ≥10 years and undetectable C-peptide levels. Two used automated insulin delivery and one multiple daily injections, with total daily insu- lin doses 0.38, 0.49 and 0.56 units/kg. Two had HbA1c <53mmol/mol (<7%) and one 72.7mmol/mol (8.8%).

**Conclusion:**
Stable free-living T1D adults not on SGLT2 inhibitor had ketone levels <1.1mmol/L over two weeks. Absent C-peptide and ≥10- year diabetes duration were associated with ketone levels >0.6mmol/L.

**Analysing real world ketone testing behaviours and glucose levels in FreeStyle Libre readers**

F. Quadri

**Background and aims:**
Periodic ketone testing is important for people living with diabetes. This observational analysis investigated the pat- terns of blood ketone testing among users of FreeStyle Libre (FSL). The primary objectives are to evaluate ketone test frequency, relation to glucose levels, and distribution of ketone levels.

**Materials and methods:**
De-identified historical data was col- lected from FSL readers from September 2014 - January 2025. Physical readers with at least one blood ketone test were included and users utilizing an app as their primary device were excluded. The frequency of ketone testing was determined for each reader. Additionally, the distribution of users within ketone ranges (normal [≤0.5 mmol/L], elevated [>0.5 - <1.5 mmol/L], high [≥1.5 - <3.0 mmol/L], DKA-risk [≥3.0 mmol/L]) was examined. The relation- ship between glucose values and ketone test timing was explored by calculating mean glucose levels 24, 3, 2, and 1 hour(s) and last glucose level 20 minutes prior to a test. The percentage of readers with glucose levels ≥250 mg/dL before ketone tests, and their cor- responding glucose levels, was analyzed.

**Results:**
A total of 3,023,587 ketone tests among 165,108 read- ers from 89 countries were analyzed. Across the tests, 82.3% were normal, 8.0% elevated, 2.6% high, and 1.7% DKA-risk for ketones. Across the readers, the proportion of readers with at least one ketone value falling within each range was 60.1% (normal), 10.0% (ele- vated), 8.7% (high), and 4.8% (DKA risk). Most (72.4%) ketone tests had a glucose value within 20 minutes prior to the test. The median glucose within 20 minutes prior to a ketone test was 311 mg/dL (IQR: 260 - 370 mg/dL) with most (78.7%) ketone tests performed when the glucose was ≥ 250 mg/dL (see the top panel of the figure). Median of average glucose at different time points prior to ketone testing are shown in the bottom panel of the figure. The mean and median number of ketone tests per day on a day where ketones were tested was 1.4±1.0 and 1.0 (IQR: 1.0 - 2.0), and 2.4±2.0 and 2.0 (IQR: 1.0 - 3.0) on days with ketone levels > 0.5 mmol/L.

**Conclusion:**
Most ketone tests were performed after the glucose was ≥ 250 mg/dL. This observation aligns with recommendations to perform a ketone test when the glucose is elevated; however, this may lead to people with diabetes missing episodes of ketonemia that can occur at lower glucose levels. When elevated ketone lev- els were detected, ketone testing frequency was higher, which is to be expected in cases where a patient may be trying to troubleshoot the root cause for high ketones. Adherence to ketone monitoring guidelines is known to be poor, which was observed in our data set. Ketone monitoring adherence could improve if measurement was more convenient.

**Continuous protein sensor for sarcopenia management during GLP-1 RA therapy**

R. Gottlieb

1. Biolinq Incorporated, San Diego, CA, USA, Biolinq, San Diego,

**Background and aims:**
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are highly effective in both weight loss and glycemic control for people with Obesity and/or Diabetes but can result in sarcopenia - loss of lean muscle mass (LLMM) (1). LLMM effects (2) can be overcome through exercise and increased protein con- sumption. Phenylalanine (phe) is an essential amino acid released from skeletal muscle breakdown and exogenous protein ingestion. A wearable phenylalanine sensor with activity monitor could track LLMM and protein ingestion for use with these transformative medications. This sensor utilizes a new methodology that relies on an engineered phe bioreceptor using a short nucleic acid sequence (aptamer) labeled with a methylene blue redox probe. This aptamer is attached to an electrode surface where the binding and concentra- tion of the phe is measured through the electrochemical technique square wave voltammetry.

**Materials and methods:**
The aptamer bioreceptor was applied to microneedle electrodes and a calibration (0, 5, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 1500 μM) was performed in phosphate buffer solution (PBS).

**Results:**
The phe sensor showed predictable linear-log calibration on day 1 and 7 (Fig 1), ­R d1: 0.986, d7:0.994, with low limit of detection d1: 3.9 μM/L, d7: 6.4 μM/L.

**Conclusion:**
This work demonstrated performance of a proof-of- concept continuous protein monitor utilizing an engineered biorecep- tor on a microsensor array that could be used in conjunction with GLP-1 RA therapy.

**Glycaemic status of adult patients with phenylketonuria: prelimi- nary data from a pilot study**

M. Kania

**Background and aims:**
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the gene, resulting in decreased metabolism of phenylalanine (Phe). Little is known about the impact of a sugar-rich low-Phe diet supplemented with Phe-free amino acid mixtures recommended in PKU. We aimed to assess the prevalence of disorders of carbohydrate metabolism and investigate glycemic profiles using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in adult patients with PKU.

**Materials and methods:**
Adult patients with PKU were matched with non-PKU controls based on age, sex, and body mass index. Glycemic status was assessed using glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c%) and CGM (Dexcom One+, Freestyle Libre 2). CGM metrics were calculated using the iglu package in ‘R’.

**Results:**
To date, we have included a total of 46 patients, comprising 26 patients with PKU and 20 non-PKU controls. The mean age of the participants was 28.74 ± 7.41 years, and 20 (43.5%) were males. The mean sensor use time was 11.414,98 ± 5.33 days. The mean HbA1c % did not differ between patients with PKU and non-PKU controls (5.02 ± 0.24% vs. 5.23 ± 0.55%; p = 0.215). There were no cases of predia- betes or diabetes in either study group, based on HbA1c Percentage (as defined by the American Diabetes Association). Average glucose values for subjects (1 to 29 - PKU and 30 to 50 - non-PKU group) across days are presented on the lasagne plot (Figure 1). The analy- sis of CGM data revealed no differences in mean glucose (103.08 ± 8.02 mg/dl vs. 105.30 ± 6.98 mg/dl; p = 0.332), time-in-range 63-140 mg/dl (3.5-7.8 mmol/l; 95.03 ± 3.97% vs. 94.19 ± 3.00%, p= 0.443), 70-180 mg/dl (3.9-10.0 mmol/L; 98.26 ± 1.37% vs. 98.98 ± 1.80%; p = 0.694), glucose management indicator (5.78 ± 0.19 vs. 5.83 ± 0.17; p = 0.331), and coefficient of variation (16.36 ± 3.14% vs. 16.73 ± 2.71; p = 0.681) between PKU and non-PKU groups. Personal glycemic state (PGS) and glucose variability percentage (GVP) were higher in patients with PKU than in non-PKU controls (9.93 ± 2.34 vs. 8.51 ± 1.79, p = 0.041, and 4.68 ± 5.97 vs. 1.35 ± 0.08, p = 0.009, respectively).

**Conclusion:**
This is the first study to assess glycemic profiles using HbA1c % and CGM in an adult PKU cohort. The HbA1c level and basic CGM metrics did not differ between individuals with PKU and healthy controls. Additional analyses suggested worse PGS and higher glycemic variability in patients with PKU, indicating discrete abnor- malities in glucose metabolism.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin resistance and features of metabolic syndrome are increasingly recognised in individuals with type 1 diabe- tes mellitus (T1DM), yet practical tools for their identification remain limited. The estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) and serum tri- glycerides are surrogate markers of insulin sensitivity. We explored their distribution across continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived glycaemic phenotypes to identify metabolic heterogeneity in T1DM.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed CGM data from 75 individuals with T1DM and 20 controls using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projec- tion followed by K-means clustering. eGDR was calculated from waist-to- hip ratio, hypertension status, and HbA1c. Serum triglyceride levels were measured via standard enzymatic assays. Comparisons across glycaemic clusters were performed using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post-hoc tests.

**Results:**
Six distinct CGM-based clusters were identified. Significant differences in triglyceride levels were observed across CGM-derived glycaemic clusters (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.04; η² = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01- 0.29). According to Dunn’s post-hoc test, triglycerides were signifi- cantly lower in the Normo-hypoglycaemic cluster compared to both the Hyperglycaemic (p = 0.03) and Normo-hyperglycaemic (p = 0.02) clusters. Unadjusted pairwise comparisons further confirmed consist- ently lower triglycerides in the Normo-hypoglycaemic cluster com- pared to all other diabetes and control groups (all p < 0.05). Similarly, eGDR levels differed significantly between clusters (H(6) = 44.7, p < 0.001), with 44.0% (95% CI: 32%-61%) of eGDR variance explained by cluster membership. The Normo-hypoglycaemic cluster exhibited the highest eGDR among T1DM groups, with significantly greater insu- lin sensitivity compared to the Hyperglycaemic (p = 0.001), Hyper- normoglycaemic (p = 0.02), and Normo-hyperglycaemic (p = 0.04) clusters. A trend toward significance was also observed between the Normo-hypoglycaemic and Hypo-hyperglycaemic clusters (p = 0.06). Compared to the control group, all clusters except the Normo-hypogly- caemic and Normoglycaemic clusters (p = 0.099) showed significantly reduced eGDR (p-values ranging from <0.001 to 0.006).

**Conclusion:**
CGM-derived glycaemic clusters in T1DM reveal sub- stantial differences in insulin sensitivity and triglyceride levels. Iden- tifying metabolically distinct profiles through data-driven glycaemic phenotyping may enable earlier detection of insulin resistance and sup- port personalised treatment strategies in T1DM.

**Comparison of the patterns of hyperglycaemia episodes in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: a secondary analysis of the Hypo- METRICS study**

B.A. Pieri

**Background and aims:**
Routine adoption of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in clinical care has created increased awareness of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia excursions. While much focus has been on the number of hypoglycaemic events, we aimed to describe the patterns of hyperglycaemic events in people with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), using data from the Hypo-METRICS study.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from Hypo-METRICS participants with at least 70% available CGM data over 10 weeks were included. Hyper- glycaemia episodes were defined as a glucose ≥ 10 mmol/L for ≥15 min. Episodes lasting over eight hours were excluded. Differences in the number, duration and maximum glucose value of hyperglycaemia episodes between T1D and insulin treated T2D were tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

**Results:**
The analysis included 566 participants (45% T1D; 45% women; 90% White; 57% using CGM/Flash glucose monitoring). People with T2D were older with a shorter diabetes duration. People with T1D and T2D had similar glycaemic control (HbA1c 7.3(6.7- 7.8) and 7.4(6.8-8.2) %). Percentage TIR was lower in T1D than T2D (61(52-72) vs 67(52-80) %), percentage TAR (>10mmol/L) was similar for T1D and T2D (31(20-45) vs 29(15-46) %). During the 10-week study period, 40,230 hyperglycaemia episodes (>10 mmol/L) were recorded for T1D and 45,713 for T2D. The weekly rates of hypergly- caemia episodes were higher in T1D than T2D (16.2(13.0-19.3) vs. 15.5(11.2-18.9); p=0.05). Median duration of hyperglycemia episodes was similar between T1D and T2D (93(74-112) vs 87(67-110) minutes, p = 0.09). People with T1D had on average a higher maximum glucose value during episodes (12.9(12.3-13.5) vs 12.4(11.9-13.1) mmol/L, p<0.001) than those with T2D.

**Conclusion:**
This analysis describes patterns of hyperglycaemia epi- sodes over a 10-week period in a multi-national study in people with optimal glycaemic control. We identified minimal differences in dura- tion and glucose peaks of hyperglycaemia episodes in people with T1D and insulin treated T2D. Weekly rates of hyperglycaemia episodes were slightly higher in T1D than T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a major com- plication of diabetes. Understanding causes and outcomes of DKA in transition from adolescence to adulthood is essential for targeted interventions and optimization of management.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective study used the Digi- tal Evaluation of Ketosis and Other Diabetes-related Emergencies (DEKODE) model to analyse 1,409 episodes of DKA in patients aged 16-25 years between 2014 and 2024 treated at 26 hospitals across the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), and Uzbeki- stan (Uzb). Clinical and biochemical characteristics, precipitating fac- tors, management, and outcomes were analysed. Statistics was per- formed using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests.

**Results:**
The median age of the cohort was 19.0 years (IQR 17.0-22.0), with 44.1% male patients. Type 1 diabetes accounted for the majority (94%) of cases. The most common precipitating factor was subopti- mal compliance to treatment (49.3%), followed by intercurrent illness (18.1%). Significant differences in pH, bicarbonate and glucose lev- els at presentation were observed between countries (p<0.001). DKA duration was longest in USA and shortest in Uzb (p=0.005). Length of hospital stay was highest in UK and USA compared to Uzb (p<0.001). Intensive treatment unit (ITU) admission rates varied, with 100% of cases in Uzb, compared to 65.7% in USA and 6.6% in UK (p<0.001). Hypokalaemia was most frequent in USA (51%) and UK (37.7%) but lower in Uzb (7%) (p<0.001). Hyperkalaemia was highest in USA (52.9%), followed by Uzb (29.8%) and UK (22.4%) (p<0.001). Hypo- glycaemia was reported in 29.3% of cases in USA, 18.3% in UK, and 3.5% in Uzb (p<0.001). There was only one death reported in USA.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights significant differences in DKA outcomes in transitional period, which may reflect differences in healthcare delivery and severity at presentation. Improved support and healthcare accessibility, and early recognition of precipitating factors are critical to mitigating DKA risks and improving outcomes in this population.

**Evaluating the effects of HCL insulin pumps on weight and HbA control in type 1 diabetes: a retrospective multi-centre study**

E. Carey, ­Mahmood, R. ­Canavan

1. St Vincent’s University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, St Columcille’s

**Background and aims:**
Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) Insulin Pumps are becoming standard care in most advanced health care systems for patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). They regularly improve glucose control even in people with previously high ­HbA c and do so with a reasonable safety profile and high treatment satisfaction. Our aim was to assess the impact of HCL pumps on two important aspects of manag- ing T1D: ­HbA c and weight.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective review of ­HbA c and weight after starting HCL pumps in T1D patients attend- ing two diabetes clinics in the east of Ireland (n=317). Independent variables included age, gender, pump type and prior pump use, while dependent variables were ­HbA c and weight, analysed using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks & Mann Whitney Tests given a non-normal distribution.

**Results:**
In our study population, the median age was 40 years, and the majority were female (53.6%). ­HbA c reduced from 62 mmol/mol (54-72), [7.8% (7.1-8.7%)] before HCL to 54 mmol/mol (50-58), [7.1% (6.7-7.5%)] on HCL, with a large effect size (r = 0.6, p < .001). There was no difference in ­HbA c between pump type (p = 0.66), gender (p = 0.38) or prior pump use (p=0.83). Among those with an initial ­HbA c of ≥55 to <65 mmol/mol (n=91), 49.5% achieved an ­HbA c of ≤53 mmol/mol, and 20.9% saw a ≥20% reduction. In patients with a base- line ­HbA c of ≥65 mmol/mol (n=135), 27.4% reached ≤53 mmol/mol, and 55.6% had a ≥20% reduction. Weight increased from 79.4 kg (69- 90.7) before HCL to 80.8 kg (70.4-92.8) on HCL, with a medium effect (r = 0.3, p < .001). In the population, 30% of patients saw an increase of ≥5% (n=88), whereas 12.7% saw a decrease of ≥5% (n=37).

**Conclusion:**
Use of HCL pumps has shown improvement in glycaemic control amongst patient with T1D, with almost half of patients with a ­HbA c of ≤65 mmol/mol achieving their target. No impact on ­HbA c was seen based on gender, pump type, or prior pump use. An increase in weight was seen, though its clinical significance remains unclear with less than a third of patients appreciating a ≥5% rise in weight.

**Background and aims:**
Depression is the most common mental health comorbidity in type 1 diabetes (T1D) with a prevalence of 20-50%. Hybrid closed loop (HCL) technology improves glycaemic control and quality of life for people with T1D but evidence of using HCL in people with comorbid depression is limited. We performed a retrospective clinical audit to evaluate the outcomes of HCL in people with T1D and depression using HCL systems at a tertiary diabetes centre.

**Materials and methods:**
Electronic patient records (EPR) were used to identify service users with type 1 diabetes mellitus and any variant of depression diagnosis. EPR records were retrospectively analysed by two independent researchers to obtain baseline demographics, pre- post- HCL glycaemic parameters, and psychiatric information. Bio- medical data were obtained for pre and post initiation of HCL via their continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and HCL cloud data sources in conjunction with EPR.

**Results:**
We identified 196 patients with T1D and co-morbid depres- sion (57 males, 139 females; ethnicity- white 61.2%, black 11.2%, mixed 6.1%, other 3.6%; age 41.5±14.1 years; diabetes duration 25.4±13.6 years; BMI 27.7±6.2 kg/m ). Of these, 47 had mixed anxiety and depression, and 30 had another additional mental health diagnosis. HCL was used by 94 (age 40.2±12.1 years; 17 males, 77 females; ethnicity -white 63.8%, black 5.3%, mixed 7.4%, other 1.1%; diabetes duration 27.1±12.6 years; BMI 29.1 ±5.5 kg/m ) and 102 people were on either open-loop insulin pump or multiple daily injec- tions (MDI) (40 males, 62 females; ethnicity - white 58.8%, black 16.7%, mixed 4.9%, other 5.9%; age 42.8±15.6 years; diabetes duration 23.7±14.3 years; BMI 26.5±6.6 kg/m ). HCL users showed a reduc- tion of glycated haemoglobin A1c ­(HbA ) from 68.15±13.64 mmol/ mol to 61.05±12.82 mmol/mol and significant improvement in time in range (TIR; defined as 3.9 - 10 mmol/L (70 - 180mg/dL)) from 41.76±17.86 to 63.79±15.49 % (both p<0.001) after HCL initiation. HCL data compared between people in indices of multiple depriva- tion (IMD) showed no significance. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) epi- sodes occurred in 2.1% of people on HCL and in 14.7% not on HCL, and severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 9.6% of patients on HCL and 15.7% not on HCL in the preceding 12 months. Mean (SD) ­HbA was 13.62 (2.79) mmol/mol lower and TIR was 22.96% (2.84) higher (both p<0.001) in HCL users compared to MDI/open loop.

**Conclusion:**
Use of HCL demonstrated a clear improvement in gly- caemic parameters such as ­HbA and TIR in people with T1D and depression. These benefits were observed when compared to people on MDI/open-loop therapy. Overall, these real-world data support the use of HCL in people with co-morbid depression in a multidisciplinary care setting. Qualitative studies and clinical trials will be needed to provide further evidence of the impact of HCL on mental health and biomedical outcomes.

**Real-world outcomes of the Omnipod 5 hybrid closed-loop system in type 1 diabetes: 6 and 12- month data from a major UK centre**

E. McNally, A. Iqbal

**Background and aims:**
Omnipod 5 (OP5) is a tubeless, automated insulin delivery system, first introduced in the UK in 2023. Clini- cal trials have demonstrated improved glycaemic control with OP5, but real-world data is limited. We measured outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months after initiating OP5 in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We aimed to assess the real-world performance of the OP5 system and provide insights into its clinical effectiveness, safety, and tolerability in uncontrolled settings.

**Materials and methods:**
A single-centre, retrospective analysis of individuals with T1D using OP5 was conducted. Data were extracted at 3, 6 and 12 months (+/- 12 weeks) following OP5 initiation. Electronic case records were reviewed for demographic characteristics, anthro- pometric data, adverse events and hospital admissions. Cloud-based applications were used to obtain glycaemic metrics from continuous glucose monitors. Two-tailed, paired t-tests were used to analyse paired data points. Results are presented as median (IQR) or mean (95% CI).

**Results:**
A total of 100 participants were included (63% female). At baseline, median age was 28 years (23.0-37.8), weight 73.8 kg (62.8- 87.3), BMI 27.0 kg/m2 (22.3-30.0), HbA1c 63.5 mmol/mol (55-78) and diabetes duration 16 years (9.0-24.8). Over half (52%) transitioned from multiple daily injections (MDI) and 15 individuals initiated OP5 along- side long-acting concomitant insulin. Detailed glycaemic metrics are summarised in Table 1. Greatest improvements were seen in the group transitioning from MDI, with % time in range (3.9-10 mmol/L) signifi- cantly increasing 37.7 to 60.3 % (-29.1 to -16.1, p<0.001, n=26) by 12 months. Overall, mean HbA1c significantly reduced from 68.0 to 57.7 mmol/mol (7.7-12.9, p<0.001, n=93) by 6 months and was maintained at 12 months, decreasing from 68.0 to 58.3 mmol/mol (6.6-13.1, p<0.001, n=64). Over 12-months, no clinically significant weight change was observed, 74.1 kg versus 74.7 kg (CI: -2.2 to 0.9 kg, p = 0.385, n = 46). OP5 users spent a median of 97% (87-100) time in automated mode and received a median of 3.7 (2.3-5.5) boluses per day. At 12 months, there was no significant change in total daily insulin dose, 49.9 versus 47.5 units (CI: -2.3 to 7.1 units, p = 0.153, n = 54). A total of 8 individuals discontinued OP5 use. We observed problematic hypoglycaemia (n = 11; three events required third-party assistance), though no hospitalisations occurred due to hypoglycaemia. Skin site reactions (n = 7), difficulties with pod application (n = 5), pump failure (n = 4), alarm fatigue (n = 4), handset failure (n = 4), and sensor failure (n = 1) were also reported. There was one hospital admission due to pump failure, three related to hyperglycaemia and two due to diabetic ketoacidosis.

**Conclusion:**
Real-world use of OP5 is associated with improvements in glycaemic control at 12 months after initiation. Notably, significant improvements in both time in range and HbA1c were observed, without an increase in time below range or significant weight gain.

2. UK, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK, St John’s Hospital, Livingston,
4. UK, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Omnipod 5 (OP5) is a tubeless AID system which was introduced in the United Kingdom in 2023. We sought to assess glycaemic outcomes, including the impact of CGM sensor choice (Libre 2 [L2] or Dexcom G6 [G6]).

**Materials and methods:**
Observational study of 353 adults with type 1 diabetes. Change in CGM metrics was assessed in individuals where paired data were available (n = 268). CGM data in the month prior to AID commencement were compared with the last available CGM data, whilst on OP5 AID. TIR response was defined as >5% and factors associated with response were assessed. Time in full automode was also assessed between those using L2 and G6 sensors. Data on AID settings were available in 298 individuals. Paired HbA1c data were available in 191 individuals (54%).

**Results:**
Median age was 42 years (IQR 32 - 53) and 56% were female. Prior to AID commencement, 29% were on MDI (71% CSII). In those with paired CGM data, 71% were using L2 sensors (29% G6). Median duration of follow up was 27 weeks. Those meeting the TIR consensus target (>70%) rose from 13% to 35% on OP5 (p <0.001) and those meeting the TBR target (<4%) rose from 74% to 85% (p <0.001). Differences in CGM metrics following OP5 are displayed in the figure (panel A). Improvement in TIR was strongly associated with lower baseline TIR (R -0.640, p <0.001) (figure panel B). GMI fell from 61 mmol/mol to 55 mmol/mol (p <0.001). Median reduction in HbA1c was -3 mmol/mol; HbA1c reduction was greatest in those with elevated HbA1c at baseline (-16 mmol/mol in those with baseline HbA1c >75 mmol/mol and -5mmol/mol in those with baseline HbA1c 58 - 75 mmol/mol). Time in full automode was slightly higher with L2 compared to G6 (96% vs. 94%, p < 0.001). TIR improvements were greater in those commencing OP5 directly from MDI (+19% vs. +12%, p = 0.001) however this was not independent of baseline TIR. 61% (183/298) were using the lowest glucose target on OP5 (6.1mM). 75% of users increased TIR >5% after starting OP5 (84% of those where TIR was <70% at baseline). Independent predictors of improved TIR included use of the lowest target glucose (6.1mM) (OR 4.4, p = 0.002), percentage of insulin delivered as bolus (OR 1.15 per %, p <0.001) and lower baseline TIR (1.18 per %, <0.001).

**Conclusion:**
OP5 is associated with clinically important improvements in all CGM metrics. Those with lowest TIR at baseline derived the greatest benefit. Use of the lowest glucose target and greater percentage of insulin delivered as bolus were also independently associated with a greater likelihood of improved TIR.

**Background and aims:**
Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems have reduced the hypoglycaemia burden in randomised controlled trials. We aimed to examine the real-world impact of initiating HCL (Omnipod-5 (OP5)) on sensor detected hypoglycaemia (SDH) in people with T1D (pwT1D) with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH).

**Materials and methods:**
A single-centre, retrospective study of pwT1D starting OP5 was conducted. Individuals with IAH (Gold score ≥4) were compared with age- and sex-matched controls (Gold score ≤2). Baseline demographics were extracted from electronic records. Dexcom Clarity 28-day glycaemic data were collected at baseline and at 12 months. Follow up data was analysed using Independent and Paired Samples t-tests or Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Data are presented as median [IQR] or mean (SD).

**Results:**
Sixty-eight, mostly white ethnicity (95.5%), pwT1D were identified of whom 44.1% were using an insulin pump prior to HCL start. Those with IAH (median Gold score 5 [4-6]) had mean age 38.2 (16) years and mean diabetes duration 21.9 (14.2) years comparable to those with normal awareness (NAH) (median Gold score 2 [1-2]) with mean age 37.9 (15.9) years and mean diabetes duration 20.2 (13.0) years. In both groups 73.5% of people were female. In those with IAH, time in range 3.9-10.0 mmol/L (TIR) (47.8%(12.3) to 58.7%(14.8), p=0.004), time >10.0 mmol/L (49.3%(20.1) to 39.3%(15.3), p=0.006) and glucose management indicator (GMI) (7.97 (1.04) to 7.55 (0.77), p=0.011) improved significantly but change in HbA1c was not sta- tistically significant (64.1 (16.2) to 60.7 (14.9), p=0.130, n=22). A significant decrease in percentage time between 3.0-3.9 mmol/L (2.3%[0.8-3.4] to 1.4%[0.6-2.0], p=0.042) was found. Although differ- ences in time <3.9mmol/L (3.1%[0.8-4.4] to 1.9%[0.8-2.9], p=0.095), <3.0mmol/L (0.7%[0.1-1.0] to 0.4 %[0.1-0.8], p=0.239) and low blood glucose index (LBGI) (0.8 [0.3-1] to 0.5 [0.2-0.7], p=0.053) were not significant. No significant changes in number of episodes <3.0 mmol/L, <3.9 mmol/L or median duration of SDH were determined. At 12 months follow-up, no difference in TIR, time >10.0 mmol/L, GMI or HbA1c was noted between those with IAH (n=28) and NAH (n=31). Significant differences in time <3.9 mmol/L (1.9%[0.7-2.9] vs. 0.6%[0.4-1.2], p=0.009), time <3.0 mmol/L (0.4%[0.1-0.8] vs. 0.1%[0.0-0.3], P=0.024), number of episodes SDH (18.0 [5.5-25.0] vs. 8.0 [3.5-14.0], p=0.024) and LBGI (0.5 [0.2-0.7] vs 0.2 [0.2-0.4], p=0.025) persisted in those with IAH compared to NAH controls despite HCL use.

**Conclusion:**
HCL use in pwT1D and IAH improved TIR, time >10.0mmol/L and GMI, with reduced percentage time between 3.0- 3.9 mmol/L. However, the hypoglycaemia burden remained higher than in those with NAH after 12 months.

**Background and aims:**
Estimating carbohydrate content and adminis- tering pre-meal boluses continue to pose a significant burden for many individuals with type 1 diabetes. Ultra-rapid insulin lispro (URIL) is associated with earlier insulin exposure and action, and earlier offset of exposure, than standard insulin lispro (IL). This study aimed to determine whether a fully closed-loop approach using URIL improves glucose control over an 8-hour period compared to IL under conditions simulating a missed meal bolus.

**Materials and methods:**
In an open-label, randomised crossover trial, 18 adults with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy (12 females, median IQR age 33.0 (29.0, 55.0) years, mean (SD) HbA1c 58.3 (8.8) mmol/mol) completed two 8-hour inpatient sessions (09:00 to 17:00 hours). During these sessions, glucose levels were managed using the CamAPS closed-loop system with either URIL or IL in random order. Participants received a standardised meal without a meal bolus at 11:00 hours. The primary outcome was the percentage of time in range (TIR) (3.9 - 10mmol/l) as recorded by sensor glucose.

**Results:**
Data from 17 participants (94%) were available for analy- sis. TIR was numerically higher but not statistically significant for URIL compared to IL (49.3%; CI 41.3-57.3% vs. 39.9%; CI 30.2- 49.7%, p=0.072). Similarly, Level 1 (>10mM) (50.7%; CI 42.7- 58.7% vs. 59.5%; CI 49.7-69.3%, p=0.098) and Level 2 hypergly- caemia (>13.9) (18.7%; CI 9.9-27.5% vs. 27.9%; CI 17.7-38.0%, p=0.136) were numerically lower for URIL. For the 4 hours after the meal a similar trend of increased TIR (23.4%; CI 16.8-30.0% vs.18.9%; CI 9.4-28.3%, p=0.356) and lower time spent in Level 1 (76.6%; CI 70.0-83.2% vs.80.3%; CI 70.0-90.6%, p=0.491) and Level 2 hyperglycaemia (33.4%; CI 19.2-47.5% vs. 45.3%; CI 29.5- 61.1%, p=0.224) were noted with URIL. Time spent in Level 1 and 2 hypoglycaemia were overall low and not significantly different (p>0.05 for all).

**Conclusion:**
Missed meal bolus during closed-loop with URIL dem- onstrated a clinically meaningful trend of increased time in range and reduced hyperglycaemia compared to IL, without any associated increase in hypoglycemia. Larger and longer-duration studies are war- ranted. Further developments in faster-acting insulins are needed to alleviate the burden of premeal bolusing and to enhance the potential of fully closed-loop systems in the future.

**Background and aims:**
Hybrid closed loop systems have revolution- ized insulin delivery in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), with the MiniMed 780G (780G) system demonstrating significant improve- ments in glycemic control. Current protocols recommend premeal bolusing, requiring carbohydrate estimation before consumption. However, approximately 34% of T1DM patients regularly administer meal boluses during or after meals, which has been associated with poorer glycemic outcomes. Ultra rapid insulin lispro (URLi) offers faster absorption kinetics than traditional insulin analogs. This pilot study aims to investigate whether the rapid absorption profile of URLi combined with the autocorrection features of the MiniMed 780G sys- tem could enable effective postmeal dosing without affecting param- eters of glycemic control.

**Materials and methods:**
Adult patients with T1DM who have been using the 780G with URLi for ≥2 months were included. Before par- ticipating in this study, all patients were routinely instructed during clinic visits to administer meal bolus doses before consuming meals. After informed consent, baseline data was collected from the Medtronic Carelink platform and subjects entered a 4-week intervention period, during which they were instructed to administer meal-bolus doses only at the end of meals.

**Results:**
We present here preliminary results from 12 patients (7/56.3% female; age 40.9 ± 16.3 years; diabetes duration 15.5 ± 11.4 years; use of the MiniMed 780G with URLi for 16.9 ± 6.8 months; HbA1c - 6.7% ± 1.0; BMI= 25.1 ± 6.0 ). Smart guard and sensor use were high and similar before and during the intervention (90.1% vs 93.9% and 88.3% vs 91.3% respectively). Comparing baseline/pre-meal bolus dosing to postmeal URLi dosing, we observed no significant differences in time in range (70-180 mg/dL) (70.0 ± 11.9% vs. 71.4 ± 10.8%, p=0.48), time in tight range (70-140 mg/dL) (45.0 ± 11.0 vs. 45.7 ± 11.3, p=0.74), glucose management indicator (GMI) (7.0 ± 0.3 % vs 7.0 ± 0.4%, p=0.29) and glycemic variability (coefficient of variation 33.8 ± 5.2% vs 32.7 ± 4.7%, p=0.41). Total daily insulin dose increased slightly (57.1 ± 36.8 vs 60.2 ± 36.7 units, p=0.03) as did basal insulin delivery (23.5 ±19.0 vs. 26.5 ± 20.6, p= 0.005).

**Conclusion:**
Postmeal dosing of URLi in the 780G system pro- vides glycemic control comparable to conventional premeal dosing in patients with T1DM. Combining ultra-rapid insulin and advanced hybrid closed loop technology may offer greater flexibility in bolus tim- ing without compromising outcomes, particularly benefiting patients who struggle with pre-meal carbohydrate estimation or prefer the con- venience of postmeal dosing.

**Background and aims:**
Women living with type 1 diabetes face a number of unique sex hormone related challenges that complicate their glycaemic management. Historically, this has caused women with diabetes to have an overall lower likelihood to achieve the gly- caemic targets throughout the lifecycle. This real-world analysis aims to investigate if the sex difference in glycaemic outcomes also exists when using automated insulin delivery, more specifically in MM780G users from pre-puberty to menopause age.

**Materials and methods:**
MiniMed™ 780G real world data, collected from CareLink™ Personal from 1 September 2023 to 31 August 2024, were analyzed according to self-reported sex. Time in glycaemic ranges, 70-140mg/dL (TING) and 70-180 mg/dL (TIR), <70 mg/dL (TBR70), <54mg/dL (TBR54), >180mg/dL (TAR180) and >250mg/ dL (TAR250) were assessed. In addition, insulin delivery, carbohydrate intake, number of user-initiated boluses per day, and total daily insulin dose (IU) were collected. Age groups are defined per self-reported age categories available in CareLink™. Users who did not report their sex were excluded from this analysis.

**Results:**
258,647 users were included in this analysis, of which 134,497 females, and 124,150 males with type 1 diabetes. Overall, mean (±SD) TIR was equal with 72.3% (± 11.2) in women, and 72.3% (± 11.5) in men. No clinical significant differences are found in all age groups, with TIR Female vs Male ranging from 71.7% (± 11.2) vs 71.8% (± 11.5) in (pre-)puberty (≤15 years), 69.3% (± 11.8) vs. 67.9% (± 12.4) in adolescents and young adults (16-28 years), 72.5% (± 11.2) vs. 71.7% (± 11.1) in childbearing age (29-42 years), 73.4% (± 10.3) vs. 73.7% (± 10.6) in the peri-menopausal age (43-55 years) and 75.9% (± 9.3) vs. 77.0% (± 9.9) in the post-menopause age (>55 years). In line with expectations, older users achieve greater TIR in both sexes, compared to younger users. Carbohydrate announcement and TDD was higher in men than in women in all age groups. The number of user- initiated boluses was on average only slightly lower in females than in males in all groups, ranging from 4.4 to 5.0 per day.

**Conclusion:**
Current real-world analysis shows that despite differences in TDD and carb announcements, males and females achieve equal outcomes using the MiniMed™ 780G system in all age groups. The automation of the MiniMed™ 780G addressed the challenges in glyce- mic control, throughout various age periods of female life.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin sudelidec (INS068) is a once-daily novel soluble long-acting insulin analog developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Efficacy and safety of INS068 and insulin glargine (IGlar) in Chinese adults with T2D inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) were compared in INS068-302, a 52-week randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled phase 3 trial.

**Materials and methods:**
Adult T2D patients with HbA1c of 7.0-11.0% who had received ≥8 weeks of OADs at stable doses were enrolled. Eli- gible patients were randomized (2:1) to receive subcutaneous INS068 QD or IGlar QD for 26 weeks, at a dose starting at 10 U daily and titrated during the treatment period, followed by a 26-week extension for long-term safety. OADs were required to be maintained at a stable dose during the study. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26, tested for non-inferiority (0.4% margin).

**Results:**
513 patients were randomized to receive INS068 (n = 341) or IGlar (n = 172) with balanced baseline characteristics. At Week 26, HbA1c decreased by 1.34% and 1.36% in the INS068 and IGlar group with baseline HbA1c of 8.44% and 8.47%, respectively. The differ- ence was 0.02% (95% CI: -0.14%, 0.18%), confirming non-inferiority in HbA1c reduction of INS068 to IGlar. Reduction of fasting plasma glucose was comparable (3.35 mmol/L vs 3.21 mmol/L) after 26-week treatment with daily dose at 0.36 U/kg and 0.38 U/kg at week 26. The effect of glycemic control was endured to Week 52, with comparable efficacy in the INS068 and IGlar groups. The incidences of overall hypoglycemia and overall nocturnal hypoglycemia were numerically lower with INS068 vs IGlar in the 26-week period. Notably, INS068 presented significantly lower risk of overall hypoglycemia and overall nocturnal hypoglycemia compared to IGlar (Table) after 52-week treat- ment. No unexpected safety findings were observed, and incidences of adverse events were similar between the two groups.

**Conclusion:**
INS068 demonstrated similar efficacy as IGlar, with sig- nificantly lower incidence of overall hypoglycemia and overall noctur- nal hypoglycemia after 52-week treatment, in uncontrolled T2D with OADs in China.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin sudelidec (INS068) is a once-daily novel soluble long-acting insulin analog developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This 26-week randomized, open-label, parallel- controlled phase 3 trial (INS068-301) compared the efficacy and safety of INS068 and insulin glargine (IGlar) in Chinese T2D patients inad- equately controlled with basal insulin.

**Materials and methods:**
Adult T2D patients with HbA1c of 7.0-10.0% who had received ≥8 weeks of basal insulin were enrolled. Oral anti- diabetic drugs were allowed if maintained at a stable dose. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive subcutaneous injection of INS068 QD or IGlar QD for 26 weeks. Insulin dose was converted from prior basal insulin and titrated during the treatment period. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26, tested for non-inferiority (0.4% margin).

**Results:**
423 patients were randomized to receive INS068 (n = 211) or IGlar (n = 212). At Week 26, HbA1c decreased by 0.70% and 0.83% in the INS068 and IGlar groups, with a difference of 0.13% (95% CI: -0.05, 0.31), confirming non-inferiority of INS068 to IGlar. Pre-breakfast plasma glucose before visits stabilized after 12-week treatment and was comparable between the two groups but numeri- cally lower in INS068. INS068 resulted in greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose compared to IGlar at Week 26 (mean change: -2.40 mmol/L vs -1.96 mmol/L; difference: -0.45 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.74, -0.16). At Week 26, daily dose of INS068 and IGlar was 0.46 and 0.48 U/kg, respectively. Compared with IGlar, INS068 demonstrated numerically lower incidence of overall hypoglycemia, with a signifi- cant reduction in overall nocturnal hypoglycemia risk (Table). No new safety signals were identified, and incidences of adverse events were similar in the two groups.

**Conclusion:**
INS068 demonstrated similar efficacy as IGlar, with a sig- nificantly lower risk of overall nocturnal hypoglycemia, in T2D patients inadequately controlled with basal insulin.

**Background and aims:**
Efsitora, a once-weekly basal insulin, has the potential to simplify therapy and reduce the treatment burden for patients with T2D. This Ph3 study assessed the efficacy and safety of efsitora vs glargine in adults with T2D treated with basal and bolus insulin.

**Materials and methods:**
The 26-wk, parallel-design, open-label trial randomised 730 adults with T2D 1:1 efsitora:glargine. Doses were titrated to FBG 4.4-6.7 mmol/L based on previous basal dose, FBG, and hypoglycaemia. The primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline to wk 26 (noninferiority margin 0.4%).

**Results:**
Mean HbA1c at baseline was 65.9 mmol/mol in both groups. Mean HbA1c change from baseline to wk 26 was noninfe- rior for efsitora (−11.1 mmol/mol) vs glargine (−11.0 mmol/mol; estimated treatment difference −0.13 mmol/mol; 95% CI −1.53 to 1.27; Figure). Percent time in range (3.9-10 mmol/L) was similar for efsitora (60.7%) and glargine (58.8%) at wk 26. Weekly basal insulin dose was lower for efsitora at wk 26 (392 U) vs glargine (427 U; p<0.001). Rates of overall combined clinically significant (<54 mg/dL [3·0 mmol/L]) or severe hypoglycaemia were similar for efsitora and glargine (6.6 vs 5.9 events per patient-year of exposure, p=0.442). Similar serious adverse events incidence was observed for both groups (p=0.881).

**Conclusion:**
In adults with T2D treated with basal and bolus insulin, efsitora demonstrated noninferior HbA1c reductions and similar rates of hypoglycaemia vs glargine.

**Background and aims:**
This post hoc analysis assessed efficacy and hypoglycaemia outcomes with once-weekly insulin icodec (ico- dec) vs once-daily (OD) basal insulin comparators in insulin-naive (ONWARDS 1, 3, 5) and insulin-experienced (ONWARDS 2, 4) adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) by diabetes duration at baseline.

**Materials and methods:**
Treatment outcomes were analysed, by trial, across baseline T2D duration subgroups (<5, 5-<10, 10-<15, ≥15 years).

**Results:**
Overall, a numerically greater reduction in ­HbA was seen with icodec vs OD comparators across T2D duration subgroups in all trials, except for certain subgroups in ONWARDS 3 and 4 ( ). There was no statistically significant treatment by T2D duration subgroup interaction in any trial for change in ­HbA from baseline to planned end of treatment (EOT). Rates of clinically significant or severe hypoglycaemia were low across arms except in ONWARDS 4 (basal-bolus trial), where rates were numerically higher in both arms across subgroups. There was no statistically significant treatment by T2D duration subgroup interaction in any trial for the achievement of ­HbA <7% at EOT without clinically significant or severe hypo- glycaemia in the prior 12 weeks.

**Conclusion:**
Efficacy and hypoglycaemia outcomes for icodec vs OD comparators were overall similar across T2D duration subgroups.

**Background and aims:**
Once-weekly basal insulins were reported to be similarly or more effective than once-daily compounds for HbA1c reduction in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, con- cerns about hypoglycemia persist in individuals on multiple daily injections. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of once-weekly basal insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL up to March 1, 2025. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing insulin icodec and efsitora against once-daily basal insulins in people with type 1 diabetes. Three reviewers independently evaluated the retrieved citations. Disagreements were settled by discussion or by a third party. Meta-analysis was performed using fixed-effect or random-effects mod- els based on heterogeneity levels. The primary outcome of the study was the change from baseline in HbA1c (estimated treatment differ- ence [ETD], 95% CI). Secondary endpoints included changes in body weight (BW), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics such as time in range (TIR) and time above range (TAR), rates of hypoglycemic events, bolus insulin doses, and patients reported outcomes (PROMS).

**Results:**
Five RCTs were included. The efficacy of once-weekly basal insulins and once-daily compounds was similar in terms of HbA1c (Fig. 1a: ETD 0.083% (95% CI -0.009 to 0.175, I2=0%; high certainty), BW (ETD -0.037 kg, 95% CI -0.998 to 0.923, I2=43.8%; moderate certainty), TIR (ETD -1.306%, 95% CI -2.705 to 0.093, I2=0%; moderate certainty), and TAR (ETD 0.978%, 95% CI -2.686 to 4.641, I2 = 19%), albeit with increased level 3 (Fig. 1b: IRR 2.532, 95% CI 1.758 to 3.645; moderate certainty) hypoglycemia rates. Once-weekly basal insulins may also increase the risk of level 2 hypoglycemia (IRR 2.532, 95% CI 1.758 to 3.645; very low cer- tainty). A significantly lower weekly bolus insulin dose was observed with once-weekly basal insulin therapy (ETR 0.837, 95% CI 0.794 to 0.882, I2 = 0%; high certainty). Treatment satisfaction was expressed as change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) status version scores in the ONWARDS 6 trial, and as mean DTSQ change version score in the QWINT-5 trial, and therefore a meta- analysis of such results could not be performed.

**Conclusion:**
This meta-analysis for the first time evaluated efficacy and safety of once-weekly basal insulins in the treatment of adults with type 1 diabetes, showing similar glucose-lowering effect with increased hypoglycemia occurrence and divergent findings on treat- ment satisfaction compared to once-daily compounds.

**Background and aims:**
The increasing prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance has created a need for highly concentrated insu- lin formulations that are suitable for prandial use. AT278 is a new ultra-rapid formulation of concentrated insulin aspart (500 IU/mL). In this study, we compared the pharmacokinetics (PK) and phar- macodynamics (PD) of AT278 with standard concentration insulin aspart (IAsp, 100 IU/mL) and concentrated human insulin (HumIns, 500 IU/mL) across a wide BMI range in people with type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a randomised, double-blind, crossover, euglycaemic clamp study in 41 adults with type 2 diabetes (37 males/4 females; BMI 25.0 to 38.7 kg/m [median BMI 29.7 kg/ m ], HbA1c 39 to 80 mmol/mol, diabetes duration 6 to 32 years). The study compared a single subcutaneous injection (0.5 IU/kg) of AT278 with IAsp, with an additional open comparison with HumIns.

**Results:**
AT278 demonstrated a significantly higher glucose-lowering effect within the first 60 min (AUC​ ) compared with both IAsp (treatment ratio 2.02 [95% CI 1.64; 2.50]) and HumIns (3.91 [2.89; 5.27]). With AT278, onset of appearance and action was 5 min earlier and and were 24 min and 25 min shorter, respectively, compared with IAsp. The significant difference in onset PK/PD parameters remained when analysed by BMI subgroups (population divided into two BMI subgroups by median split). How- ever, only IAsp showed a BMI-related response: AUC​ was significantly lower (P <0.0001) while the time to was sig- nificantly increased (P = 0.0300) with IAsp in participants with BMI >29.7 kg/m . Linear regression analysis showed a negative relation of BMI vs. AUC​ (P <0.0001) and a positive relation of BMI vs. (P = 0.0040) for IAsp. With HumIns, onset PK/PD parameters were significantly delayed. Overall insulin exposure was similar for AT278 compared with IAsp and overall glucose-lowering effects were similar across all insulin preparations.

**Conclusion:**
AT278 exhibited significantly accelerated early PK/PD properties compared with IAsp in overweight and obese people with type 2 diabetes. Whilst IAsp showed slower early glucose-lowering action with increasing BMI, AT278 maintained its ultra-fast properties regardless of BMI, potentially improving quality of life for people with diabetes on high-dose insulin therapy.

**Background and aims:**
Optimal glycaemic control with minimal hypoglycaemia is vital for people with type 2 diabetes (PWT2D) with advancing age. BRIGHT study compared the efficacy and safety of insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300) vs insulin degludec 100 U/ mL (IDeg-100) in insulin-naïve PWT2D. This post-hoc analysis assessed derived time-in-range (dTIR; calculated using capillary 8-point self-monitored blood glucose profiles) in PWT2D compar- ing Gla-300 vs IDeg-100 in participants aged <70 and ≥70 years.

**Materials and methods:**
BRIGHT was a multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, 24-week trial. This analysis assessed changes in dTIR (70-180 mg/dL), derived time-below-range (dTBR <70 mg/ dL), derived time-above-range (dTAR >180 mg/dL) from baseline to Week 24 and number of participants (%) achieving dTIR >70%, ≥5% improvement in dTIR and triple target (dTIR >70%, dTBR <4%, dTAR <25%) at Week 24.

**Results:**
Overall, 768 participants (Gla-300, n=392; IDeg, n=376) were <70 years and 161 participants (Gla-300, n=74; IDeg, n=87) were ≥70 years old. LS Mean±SE dTIR change in participants <70 years was 29.8±1.33% (Gla-300) and 28.8±1.39% (IDeg-100) while 33.2±2.91% (Gla-300) and 27.8±2.62% (IDeg-100) for par- ticipants ≥70 years at Week 24 (Table 1). At week 24, the proportion of participants achieving triple target were 42.2% (<70 years) and 38.4% (≥70 years) with Gla-300 while 39.7% (<70 years) and 33.3% (≥70 years) with IDeg-100. Additionally, the proportion of partici- pants achieving dTIR >70% was 58.6% (<70 years) and 60.3% (≥70 years) with Gla-300, compared to 56.0% (<70 years) and 52.9% (≥70 years) with IDeg-100, while the proportion achieving ≥5% improve- ment in dTIR was 58.4% (<70 years) and 57.5% (≥70 years) with Gla-300, compared to 55.7% (<70 years) and 54.0% (≥70 years) with IDeg-100. At Week 24, proportion of glucose values in dTIR for participants receiving Gla-300 were 77.2% (<70 years) and 79.8% (≥70 years) and for IDeg-100 were 77.4% (<70 years) and 74.9% (≥70 years). dTBR was low and at target for all groups.

**Conclusion:**
In PWT2D, Gla-300 and IDeg-100 improved dTIR, reduced dTAR, without increasing dTBR in older participants (≥70 years).

**Background and aims:**
Automated insulin delivery systems (AID) are becoming increasingly important and improve glycaemic control. This study investigates the use, satisfaction and, challenges of AID from the perspective of both healthcare professionals (HCPs) and people with diabetes (PwD).

**Materials and methods:**
In 11/12 2024, a total of 1,255 HCPs (dia- betologists, diabetes educators; mean age 50.8 years; female: 82.2 %; endos = 402; diabetes educator = 853) and 2,515 PwD (female 50 %; type 1 diabetes 72.8 %, AID 46 %, age (children) 10 years, adults 52 years; type 2 diabetes 18.1 %, age 64 years) in Germany (GER), Austria (A), Switzerland (CH) and Spain (ES) were surveyed using a question- naire about their experiences and views on the use of AID.

**Results:**
The proportion of AID users with TD1 ranges from 40% (A), 36% (CH), 30% (GER) to 15% (ES) and, according to the HCPs, increased by approximately 10% between 2023 and 2024. For the next five years, an increase of AID to 75% (A), 72% (CH), 71% (GER) and 56% (ES) is expected, also for PwD and TD2 with an MDI (36% (A), 34% (A), 26% (GER), 22% (ES)). Regarding the medical indication for AIDs the HCPs were in strong agreement in their assessment for 91% (88-93%) for children with TD1 and 88% for adults with TD1 (85%- 90%). The indication of AID for TD2 and MDI (78% (ES), 70% (A), 65% (CH), 55% (GER)) and TD2 and basal only (57% (ES), 45% (A), 40% (CH), 29% (GER)) is seen significantly different. Approximately 23% of all PwD TD1 who are offered an AID refuse it, with the main barrier cited being the need to wear a device on the body (44%) and satisfaction with previous MDI therapy (43%). Approximately 8% of users discontinue AID and 1 in 5 users (18%) have difficulties with its use. The main cause of problems is seen by 57% of the HCPs and 52% of PwD as being technical difficulties, particularly in connection problems between the sensor and the insulin pump. For PwD (46%), the large number of alarms is also stressful. The biggest challenges for HCPs are keeping step with rapid technological development (66%), lack of human resources (57%) and the effort involved in submitting a request (57%). For PwD, the main reasons for choosing an AID are the user-friendliness of the AID system (49%), the quality of the algorithm (44%) and the size and weight of the insulin pump, while data protec- tion plays only a very minor role (4%).

**Conclusion:**
AID systems will soon become the standard therapy for type 1 diabetes in the countries studied, and also offer the potential for people with type 2 diabetes and insulin therapy. The relatively high discontinuation rates and the difficulties in implementing therapy show that there are still challenges to be met in the further implementation of AID systems in clinical practice.

**Effect of automated insulin delivery systems initiation on reduc- tion of hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes: retrospective single-centre study**

P. Novodvorsky, Cechova, F. Hruby, P. Girman, M. Dubsky, M. Haluzík

**Background and aims:**
Automated Insulin Delivery systems (AID) improve glycaemic outcomes and reduce time spent in hypoglycae- mia in people with type 1 diabetes (PwT1D). We assessed the effect of AID initiation (MiniMed 780G, Tandem t:slim X2, CamAPS FX hybrid closed-loop system) in PwT1D on reduction of hypoglycaemia in real-world settings.

**Materials and methods:**
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from our local registry (entered once yearly at the last clinic visit of the corresponding year) were used for the analysis. All PwT1D who were initiated on any AID in our centre throughout the year 2023 were included in the study. CGM data the year before and after AID initia- tion were compared.

**Results:**
Altogether 219 PwT1D (121/219, 55% women) with mean (SD) age 42 (15) years, diabetes duration 24 (12) years were analysed. Of these, 168/219 (77%) were previously on non-AID pumps and 51/219 (33%) were on multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) regi- men. Following AID initiation, time below range (TBR) reduced (mean paired difference [95%CI]) (-2.6 [-3.4, -1.8] %), level 1 hypoglycaemia reduced (-1.7 [-2.4, -1.1] %), and level 2 hypoglycaemia (-0.9 [-1.2, -0.6] %) reduced (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Time in Range (TIR) increased (13.2 [10.8, 15.5] %), time above range (TAR) decreased (-10.5 [-12.9, -8.2] %), mean sensor glucose decreased (-0.72 [-0.93, -0.52] mmol/L), glycaemic variability (%CV) improved (-3.6 [-4.7, -2.6] %) and glycaemia risk index (GRI) improved (-19.9 [-23.2, -16.5]) (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Reductions in TBR, level 1 and level 2 hypoglycaemia were observed with all 3 AIDs: for MiniMed 780G (n = 86): (-3.6 [-5.1, -2.1] %,), (-2.5 [-3.9, -1.2] %), and (-1.0 [-1.6, -0.5] % (p < 0.001 for all comparisons); for Tandem t:slim X2 (n = 94): (-2.1 [-3.2, -1.0] %, p < 0.001), (-1.3 [-2.0, -0.5] %, p < 0.001), and (-0.8 [-1.4, -0.3] %, p = 0.005), and for CamAPS FX system (n = 39): (-1.9 [-3.6, -0.3] %, p < 0.001), (-1.2 [-2.3, -0.1] %, p = 0.016) and (-0.7 [-1.4, -0.1] %, p = 0.033). The difference in reductions between MiniMed 780G and CamAPS FX were statistically significant for TBR (-1.7 [-3.1, -0.2] %, p = 0.016) and for level 2 hypoglycaemia (-0.5 [-0.9, -0.1] %, p = 0.006), both in favour of MiniMed 780G.

**Conclusion:**
Initiation of all three AIDs in PwT1D statistically signifi- cantly and clinically meaningfully reduced time spent in hypoglycae- mia in our cohort. Highest reductions were observed with the MiniMed 780G.

**Background and aims:**
Fasted morning exercise is considered safe for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. However, most studies have only focused on the immediate post-exercise period under laboratory-controlled condi- tions. Recently, the use of exogenous glucagon has gained interest to minimize exercise-induced hypoglycemia, but it’s legacy effects post- exercise remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to study 24-hour glucose levels after exercise with and without subcutaneous glucagon given pre-exercise and to compare glucose levels on trial days with days where exercise was avoided.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a post-hoc analysis of a two-period, cross-over study which included 10 adults with T1D (age 42-67 years; diabetes duration 14-44 years; HbA1c 47-69 mmol/mol) using the MiniMed 780G AID. On two separate occasions, participants attended the laboratory and cycled for 45-minutes at a fixed workload (60% VO ) having avoided physical activity the day before. The two trial days differed by giving participants 150ug of subcutaneous glucagon before exercise (Glucagon) or not (Control). Sensor glucose metrics taken during the 24-hour trial days were split into the following time periods and compared against each other as well as those from the day before: end of trial (1-hour post-excercise) to midnight and overnight (00:00-06:00). Paired Student’s t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used as appropriate.

**Results:**
Results are shown in table 1. In comparing trial days, there were no differences in any glycemic metrics at any of the time peri- ods between Glucagon vs Control. When comparing the exercise days to their respective day before, there was no increased risk of hypoglycemia nor was there any evidence of glycemic discrepancies at any time period regardless of whether glucagon was given or not.

**Conclusion:**
In adults with T1D using MiniMed 780G AID, per- forming fasted morning exercise carries no increased risk of post- exercise or nocturnal hypoglycemia regardless of whether exogenous glucagon was administered beforehand. These data may be useful for clinical decision making when prescribing exercise to adults with T1D using AIDs.

**Glycaemia risk index before and 12 months after hybrid closed loop (HCL) initiation in the CIRDIA, an out-of-hospital French HCL initiation centre**

S. Picard

3. ble, France, Besancon University Hospital, Besancon, France.

**Background and aims:**
Glycemia Risk Index (GRI) accounts for hypo- glycemia and hyperglycemia risk with a single number ranging from 0 (minimal risk) to 100 (maximal risk). We have previously shown that a GRI threshold <26 identifies with a very good specificity (92%) and negative predictive value (93%) persons living with type 1 diabetes (PwT1D) who reach glucose combined Efficacy and Safety Targets (EST) = Time In Range ­(TIR ) >70% and Glucose Manage- ment Indicator (GMI) <7% and Time Below Range (TBR) <4% and ­TBR <1%. We aimed to determine if the GRI value at hybrid closed loop (HCL) initiation ­(M GRI) can predict who is going or not to reach EST 12 months later ­(M EST+ or ­M EST-).

**Materials and methods:**
This was a rolling retrospective study that did not required ethics committee approval. Consecutive non-pregnant PwT1D who had HCL initiation in a CIRDIA (Inter-Regional Center for Automized Insulin in Diabetes) out-of-hospital center were included after they had signed a consent form. Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) parameters were manually extracted from HCL platforms and GRI was calculated using an online calculator with GRI zone allocation (zone A: 0-20 to zone E: 81-100).

**Results:**
Data was available at 12 months ­(M ) for 128 PwT1D (52% women, mean age 42.9±14.0 years, type 1 diabetes for 23.7±12.1 years, BMI: 27.5±5.0 kg/m ). HCL systems were Medtronic 780G (78.1%), Control IQ (12.5%) and CamAPS (9.4%). GRI decreased from 56.4±21.0 at initiation ­(M ) to 30.1±14.1 at ­M (p<0.0001). The Figure shows GRI grids at ­M and ­M . The GRI hyperglycemic component improved in 91% of the participants whereas the hypoglycemic component improved in 49%. ­M EST+ patients (44%) had a lower ­M GRI (45.9±18.5) than ­M EST- patients (64.5±19.4) (p<0.0001). ROC analyses showed that a ­M GRI value <41 (GRI zones AB) had a good specificity to predict ­M EST+ since 90% of ­M EST- patients had a ­M GRI value ≥ 41, but a low sensitivity since only 41% of ­M EST+ patients had a ­M GRI value <41. Conversely, a ­M GRI value <61 (GRI zones ABC) had an 80% sensitivity to detect ­M EST+ patients. Interestingly, for ­M GRI <41 or ­M GRI <61, the same specificity and sensitivity were observed to predict either ­M EST+ or a ­M GRI value <26.

**Conclusion:**
Calculating the GRI value at HCL initiation can help focusing intensive training in PwT1D with a high level of GRI, starting at values at or above 41 (GRI zones CDE). But even PwT1D with very high ­M GRI values (61-100, GRI zones DE) can reach glucose efficacy and safety targets at ­M .

**Background and aims:**
Achieving glycemic targets in type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains challenging despite automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. It would be, therefore, suitable to identify additional indicators linking the algorithm performance to the patient’s metabolic achieve- ments, in order to guide users and their healthcare givers towards an optimal AID performance. This study aimed to correlate the parameters of advanced hybrid closed loop (AHCL) function to the glycometa- bolic outcomes in a cohort of patients with T1D using different AHCL systems.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a retrospective cross-sectional study on 124 adult (n=87) and pediatric (n=37) T1D consecutive patients recruited between January and November 2024 at our hospital. We cor- related the total daily insulin dose (TDD), the total daily basal (TDBa) and bolus (TDBo) insulin doses, the percentage of auto-bolus out of total daily bolus (Automated Correction Index - ACI) to the ­HbA and the sensor-derived metrics.

**Results:**
The ACI was the only AHCL-derived parameter directly associated to HbA1c (p=0.03) and time above range (TAR​ range ­(TIR , p<0.01). An optimal ACI cut-off point of 30% was detected at the Youden test. Patients with ACI <30% showed reduced HbA1c levels (6.21% ± 0.5 vs. 6.95% ± 0.8, p=0.02) and a higher probability of having TIR >70% (OR 3.18, CI 1.19-8.46, p=0.02) and coefficient of variation (CV) <36% (OR 2.86, CI 1.07- 8.27, p=0.03) compared to those with ACI ≥30%. These findings were confirmed both in adult and in pediatric patients. No correlations have been found between TDD, TDBa, TDBo and the different parameters of glucose control/variability Figure shows Time in range (TIR), Time below range (TBR), and Time above range (TAR) distribution according to the ACI threshold of 30 %; * Indicates a statistically significant difference (p<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
The ACI could represent a useful and easy-to-assess metric for AHCL-treated individuals with T1D. In our cohort an ACI <30% was associated to better glucose control and variability.

3. Egypt, Diabetes Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine,

**Background and aims:**
Ramadan Iftar meal typically causes glucose excursions. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors increase glucagon-like peptide-1 and thus, decrease blood glucose levels with low risk of hypoglycemia. To investigate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin as an add-on therapy among adolescents and young adults with type 1 dia- betes mellitus (T1DM) on glucose excursions of Iftar Ramadan meals and glycemic metrics during advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
Fifty T1DM patients on MiniMed™ 780G AHCL were randomly assigned either to receive vildagliptin (50 mg tablet) with iftar meal or not. All participants received pre- meal insulin bolus based on insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) for each meal constitution.

**Results:**
Vildagliptin offered exceptional euglycemia with time in range (TIR) significantly increased at end of Ramadan in intervention group from 77.8 ± 9.6% to 84.7 ± 8.3% (p=0.016) and time above range (180-250 mg/dL) decreased from 13.6 ± 5.1% to 9.7 ± 3.6% (p=0.003) without an increase in hypoglycemia. This is together with concomitant blunting of post-meal glucose surges (207.5 ± 51.3 mg/ dL versus 177.2 ± 45.7 mg/dL; p=0.033) and a significant reduction in automated daily correction boluses and total bolus dose by 23.9% and 16.3% (p=0.015 and p<0.023, respectively) with less aggressive ICR settings within intervention group at end of Ramadan. Coefficient of variation was improved from 37.0 ± 9.4% to 31.8 ± 7.1%; p=0.035). No severe hypoglycemic or diabetic ketoacidosis were reported.

**Conclusion:**
Adjunctive vildagliptin treatment mitigated postprandial hyperglycemia compared with pre-meal bolus alone. Vildagliptin sig- nificantly increased TIR while reducing glycemic variability without compromising safety.

**Background and aims:**
Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems are recognised as the optimal treatment for managing type 1 diabe- tes. Evaluation of user experience with AID systems is crucial. The continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system is an essential compo- nent of AID systems, and user satisfaction with the CGM system can profoundly impact the overall satisfaction with the AID system. The aim of the study was to evaluate the change in user satisfaction after upgrading to a new CGM system as part of the same AID system.

**Materials and methods:**
A prospective evaluation was performed. Subjects with type 1 diabetes, 15 years old or older, simultaneously upgraded from the Medtronic ­MiniMed 780G with Guardian Sen- sor® 4 to the Medtronic ­MiniMed 780G with Simplera ­Sync . Both sensors are calibration-free and share a 7-day sensor life, but Simplera ­Sync is a disposable all-in-one sensor, while Guardian Sensor® 4 has a reusable transmitter that requires charging. The Glucose Monitoring Experience Questionnaire (GME-Q), a vali- dated questionnaire designed to specifically assess satisfaction with a glucose monitoring system in its linguistically validated version, was completed by all the participants before the upgrade and after 3 months of use of the new sensor. The GME-Q includes 23 items with a 5-point Likert scale, from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Total satisfaction and three subscales, convenience, intrusiveness, and effectiveness, were computed. For this calculation, the sum of scores divided by the number of items completed was used. Negatively worded items were reversed before the calculation. The total satisfac- tion score and each subscale score range from 1 to 5, with higher scores meaning a higher satisfaction level, except for the intrusiveness domain, where higher scores reflect a lower satisfaction level. A final open-ended question was included, asking for the differences between the two sensors.

**Results:**
Ninety-one subjects with type 1 diabetes were included; base- line characteristics were as follows: age: 38 ± 15 years old, < 18 years old: 17% (n = 15), sex: 59% (n = 54) females, diabetes duration: 20 ± 13 years. Differences in GME-Q scores before initiating the new Simplera ­Sync sensor and after 3 months of use are summarised in Table 1. The percentage of participants reporting a high global satisfaction (score ≥ 4) increased from 36% (n = 33) with Guardian Sensor® 4 to 82% (n = 75) with Simplera ­Sync . Greater ease of use with the new sensor was the most frequent comment in the open- ended question.

**Conclusion:**
The first user experience evaluation with the new sensor Simplera ­Sync shows higher satisfaction than with Guardian Sen- sor® 4, integrated into the Medtronic ­MiniMed 780G AID system. This satisfaction was evaluated by the validated and linguistically adapted questionnaire GME-Q, which includes global satisfaction, effectiveness, convenience, and intrusiveness.

**Background and aims:**
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) adds to the complexity of insulin dosing and glycaemic instability in those with diabetes. We aimed to compare feasibility, safety, and efficacy of automated insulin delivery (AID) with multiple daily injections (MDI) in people with diabetes and advanced CKD.

**Materials and methods:**
In a multicentre cross-over trial adults with T1D or T2D who were receiving multiple daily insulin therapy (MDI) with >Stage 3b CKD in random order were assigned 8 weeks continuous glucose monitoring (CGM [Medtronic Guardian™ 4]) with MDI or AID (Minimed™ 780G) and then crossed over to the other therapy. When assigned AID, insulin action time (IAT) was initially set at 4 hours with a target of 6.7mmol/L which at the inves- tigator’s discretion which could subsequently be reduced and the automated bolus function which was initially turned off could be activated. Comparisons were made between the final 3 weeks of each arm.

**Results:**
Seventeen T1D and 13 T2D participants (Median [IQR] age 61 [56,69] Y; HbA1c 8.6 [7.5, 9.1] % / 70 [58.76] mmol/mol; total daily insulin 0.6 [0.45, 0.82] Units/kg/Day; eGFR 31[24.36]) mL/min/1.73 ­m ) were recruited of which 27 were not on dialysis, 1 on peritoneal dialysis, and 2 on haemodialysis. Nineteen (63%) had retinopathy, 13 (43%) neuropathy, and 11 (37%) had coronary artery disease. Four (13%) were robust, 20 (67%) were pre-frail, and 6 (20%) were frail. As shown in Table 1, AID significantly improved almost all CGM metrics compared to MDI. Those on dialy- sis achieved similar CGM outcomes to the overall cohort. There were no device attributable serious adverse events.

**Conclusion:**
AID is feasible, safe, and compared with MDI provides superior glucose control in predominantly non-robust people with diabetes complicated by advanced CKD. The Automated Insulin Delivery in Diabetes and Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease Study Group

**Improved glycaemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes using**

**Background and aims:**
Insulin pump therapy is increasingly used in type 1 diabetes, but real-world data on its impact on glycemic con- trol at the population level remains limited. We evaluated glycemic outcomes among Finnish adults with type 1 diabetes with a focus on insulin pump users.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a nationwide register-based cohort study using Finnish health care registers between 2014 and 2021. Adults with type 1 diabetes were identified based on diagnosis codes and continuous insulin use. Insulin pump users were defined as individuals whose insulin purchases consisted predominantly of rapid-acting insulin, reflecting pump therapy use. HbA1c values were obtained from hospital data lakes and from a national laboratory data- base. The proportion of individuals using insulin pumps and changes in HbA1c levels were analyzed over time.

**Results:**
The proportion of adults with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps increased from 10.0% in 2014 (total number of adults with T1D 31843) to 16.7% in 2021 (total number of adults with T1D 35574). During the same period, the mean HbA1c of adults with Type 1 diabe- tes in Finland decreased from 66.8 mmol/mol (8.3%) to 65.1 mmol/mol (8.1%). While the proportion of individuals with HbA1c > 75 mmol/ mol (> 9.0%) decreased slightly in the overall population, this reduc- tion was more pronounced among insulin pump users. Conclusions

**Conclusion:**
In this large national cohort, insulin pump therapy was associated with better glycemic control as well as greater improvements in glycemic control than conventional therapy. These findings support the continued adoption of insulin pump technology in clinical practice to improve long-term outcomes in type 1 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Adolescence and young adulthood have tra- ditionally been associated with significant deteriorations in glycaemic outcomes, and decreased engagement for young people (YP) with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Data published in 2023 from the National Diabetes Audit in the UK has shown an increase in median HbA1c from 60 to 73 mmmol/mol from the age of 9 to 19 years. In addition, engage- ment, defined as at least one HbA1c reading within a 12 month period is reduced to ~80%. In our city paediatric and adult diabetes teams have held combined transition clinics for 16 to 25 year olds for over a decade. These multidisciplinary clinics comprise of doctors and nurses from both paediatric and adult services, a dietician, and clini- cal psychology. We have prioritised engagement alongside biomedical outcomes and audited outcomes. For example, we never discharge anyone unless we know they are receiving specialist secondary care elsewhere. We have targeted those with the poorest glycaemic out- comes, encouraging them to trial the latest technologies. In this study we aim to compare outcomes, and hybrid closed loop usage (HCL), across all ages.

**Materials and methods:**
Data up to the end of December 2024, of 256 children attending a paediatric hospital, and 2,882 adults attending the corresponding secondary care hospital were combined in order to compare outcomes. The latest mean + SD and median values HbA1c were calculated. Rates of use of HCL were also examined.

**Results:**
The mean age (years)  +  SD, and duration of T1D (years) + SD of children 0-14 years (n=180) was 10.1 + 3.4 and 4.4 + 3.3, in YP 15-25 years (n=486) 20.7 + 3.0 and 10.2 + 5.6, and in adults >26 years (n=2472) 50.5 + 15.6 and 25.6 + 15.7. Engagement was high in all 3 groups, with 99.9%, 95.5% and 92.8% of children, YP and adults respectively, having an HbA1c recorded in 2024. Children were more likely to be on HCL, 85.6%, and more YP were on HCL than adults, 56.9% versus 20.1%, p<0.05. In children aged <14 years, the HbA1c mean + SD was 54.2 + 8.6, compared to 62.0 + 18.5 in YP aged 15 to 25, and 64.1 + 16.5 in adults aged >26 years. The corresponding medians for children, YP and adults were 53, 57 and 61 respectively. HbA1c outcomes for children are stable until the age of 12, then increase, before plateauing from the age of 15 to 26, see Figure 1.

**Conclusion:**
Engaging YP with T1D in specialist diabetes care is of paramount importance. By designing a service according to their needs, YP know they are always welcome, attendance rates are high, and the service can offer the latest technological advances. In the era of hybrid closed loop, we have reduced the magnitude and the number of years over which glycaemic deterioration is usually observed in adolescence and young adulthood, meaning more YP can expect to live more normal lives, with lower risks of microvascular complica- tions in the future.

**Background and aims:**
Ethnicity and socioeconomic factors contrib- ute to enhanced morbidity and mortality in people with type 1 diabetes. This greater burden can be influenced by reduced opportunity to access specialised healthcare and diabetes technologies. Objective identifica- tion and prioritisation of people at highest clinical in resource stretched healthcare systems can be challenging. Data-led prioritization (DLP) uses digital health data and informatics to objectively identify and risk- stratify people with type 1 diabetes based on new onset risk factors since their last clinic review. This approach may address implicit bias, structural racism, and other barriers to care. However, there is limited data on using such systems in people with type 1 diabetes. We aimed to assess the impact digital health tool using DLP in people with type 1 diabetes attending outpatient clinics in a university hospital serving ethnically diverse population.

**Materials and methods:**
We implemented our digital DLP tool in a pilot study for 3 months in 2023 to identify, risk-stratify and establish follow-up intervals tailored to individual clinical needs. The modifiable risk factors that could be addressed were derived from routine clinical data collected from hospital electronic health care records. The risk criteria were new clinical events/results (occurring after their last dia- betes clinic attendance): 1. A diabetes related emergency department visit/ hospitalisation 2. HbA1c >86 mmol/mol 3. Concerning HbA1c trend (HbA1c rise >20 mmol/mol) 4. estimated GFR <30 ml/min 5. Concerning eGFR trend (eGFR fall >15 ml/min), or 6. Treatment for advanced diabetic eye disease (e.g. photocoagulation). People with high risk defined as one or more of the six red flag criteria are flagged on a dashboard system. Using this approach clinical and demographic data were collected from electronic health records of 697 adults pwT1D ( 50.5% female, 23.5% non-white ethnicity and 37% were from a poor socioeconomic background) were evaluated.

**Results:**
Using this method of the 697 people with type 1 diabetes assessed 76 people (10.9%) were identified as being in the highest- risk group with new risk events since their last clinic review. It was noted that non-white patients were more likely to be in the high- est-risk group (30/164, 18.3%) than white patients (35/372, 9.4%), p=0.004 and those with the greatest socioeconomic deprivation more likely to be in the highest-risk group (40/256, 15.7%) than the rest of the cohort (36/433, 8.3%), p=0.008. Our digital approach helped proactively identify people with diabetes at highest need for clinical prioritisation and guide clinical decision making.

**Conclusion:**
Our results suggest that a digital health informatics based tool could be effective in objective stratification based on clini- cal risk in people with type 1 diabetes while minimising bias based on ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Digital health informatics approaches such as ours are an important tool to enhance care and improve efficiency of clinical service delivery for people with dia- betes at highest need and can help address inequity in diabetes care.

**Background and aims:**
The DiaMonT trial compared glycaemic out- comes seen with a telemonitoring intervention (Fig) vs standard of care in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with insulin. This post hoc analysis of the DiaMonT trial explored insulin injection patterns.

**Materials and methods:**
Participants (n=331) were randomised 1:1 to telemonitoring (treatment arm) or standard of care (control arm) for 13 weeks. Injection adherence (defined as number of missed doses) and number of bolus correction doses were assessed using linear mixed models with patient as a random effect.

**Results:**
Both basal and bolus adherence was significantly higher in the treatment arm vs the control arm (p<0.001 and p=0.015, respectively). Estimated least-squares mean [95% CI] probability of skipping a basal dose was 1.3% [1.0; 1.7] in the treatment arm and 3.0% [2.4; 3.8] in the control arm. Mean [95% CI] probability of a day with ≥1 missing bolus dose was lower in the treatment arm (43.6% [38.6; 48.7]) than the control arm (56.5% [48.0; 64.7]). Correction doses were more fre- quently administered in the treatment arm (3.5% [95% CI 2.7; 4.7] of days) than in the control arm (1.3% [95% CI 0.8; 2.1] of days).

**Conclusion:**
Telemonitoring was associated with better injection adherence and higher frequency of correction doses than standard of care. These data suggest that telemonitoring using connected devices could help support adults with T2D optimise insulin treatment.

**Greater decline in fasting C-peptide predicts better glycaemic remission after short-term intensive insulin therapy in newly diag- nosed type 2 diabetes**

Q. Chen

**Background and aims:**
Short-term intensive insulin therapy has been demonstrated to induce long-term glycemic remission in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. However, the predictors of remis- sion remain uncertain. This study aims to investigate the relationship between fasting C-peptide levels, as well as their changes before and after intensive therapy, and glycemic remission.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 222 newly diagnosed type 2 dia- betes patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups: Group A (n = 110) and Group B (n = 112). After baseline assessments, all Participants underwent continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) until normoglycemia was achieved. Following the attainment of glycemic targets, Group A continued CSII for an additional 1 week before transitioning to a 4-week regimen of basal insulin combined with metformin as maintenance therapy, while Group B continued CSII for 2 weeks. Participants were subsequently followed up for 16 weeks. Based on blood glucose levels at 16 weeks, participants were categorized into a glycemic remission group and a non-remission group. Fasting C-peptide levels were measured both before and after intensive treatment.

**Results:**
After CSII, substantial reductions in blood glucose param- eters, improvements in lipid profiles, and recovery of both β-cell func- tion and insulin sensitivity were observed. Fasting C-peptide levels decreased significantly after intensive therapy (2.50 ± 0.86 vs. 2.11 ± 0.67 nmol/L, P = 0.000). Before CSII, fasting C-peptide levels were significantly higher in the remission group compared to the non-remis- sion group (2.59 ± 0.89 vs. 2.27 ± 0.73 nmol/L, P = 0.013). After CSII, no significant difference in fasting C-peptide levels was found between the remission and non-remission groups (2.12 ± 0.67 vs. 1.98 [1.69, 2.55] nmol/L, P = 0.785). However, the change in fasting C-peptide (ΔC-peptide) was significantly greater in the remission group (-14.32 ± 27.34 vs. -4.40 ± 29.98%, P = 0.018), particularly in patients with baseline fasting C-peptide levels between 1.4 and 2.5 nmol/L (-13.85 [-28.12, 1.43] vs. 7.64 ± 33.62%, P = 0.001).Subgroup analysis con- firmed this trend across Group A (-10.34 ± 20.76 vs. 9.92 ± 40.23%, P = 0.042) and Group B (-18.65 [-28.12, 2.63] vs. 5.43 [-8.37, 13.41]%, P = 0.007), patients aged over 55 years (-12.50 [-28.29, 4.91] vs. 7.88 ± 37.84%, P = 0.021) or under 55 years (-15.32 [-22.49, -2.58] vs. 7.36 [-12.07, 17.24]%, P = 0.014), males (-16.13 [-28.29, 2.22] vs. 15.40 ± 37.24%, P = 0.001), and those with fasting glucose >11.1 mmol/L at baseline (-8.87 [-26.63, 3.57] vs. 12.17 ± 36.28%, P = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis revealed that ΔC-peptide was an independent predictor of glycemic remission (odds ratio 0.988, 95% CI 0.978-0.999, P = 0.045), with a stronger association in patients with baseline C-peptide levels between 1.4 and 2.5 nmol/L (odds ratio 0.969, 95% CI 0.951-0.988, P = 0.003). Receiver operating character- istic (ROC) analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.695 (95% CI 0.587-0.804, P = 0.001), with an optimal cutoff for fasting C-peptide reduction of 0.8% (specificity 75.2%, sensitivity 61.1%).

**Conclusion:**
Greater reduction in fasting C-peptide levels after CSII is strongly associated with a higher likelihood of glycemic remission in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients, particularly those with baseline levels between 1.4 and 2.5 nmol/L.

**Background and aims:**
Fasting plasma C-peptide levels provide insight into endogenous insulin secretion and have been used to strat- ify insulin therapy requirements in type 2 diabetes. A fasting plasma C-peptide <0.08 nmol/L indicates near-absolute insulin deficiency, while levels between 0.08 and 0.25 nmol/L are associated with insulin dependence for optimal glycaemic control. However, the predictive value of fasting plasma C-peptide for future insulin therapy remains unclear in individuals with preserved insulin secretion. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of clinical characteris- tics and fasting beta-cell function markers for insulin therapy initia- tion in Chinese individuals with non-insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes and assess whether these markers provide additional predictive value beyond clinical characteristics.

**Materials and methods:**
A prospective cohort of 2,535 non-insulin- deficient (fasting plasma C-peptide ≥0.25 nmol/L) individuals with type 2 diabetes, enrolled between 1996 and 2012, was followed for insulin therapy initiation until 2019. Data were randomly split into training (n = 1,774) and test (n = 761) datasets. Cox regression with stepwise model selection guided by the Bayesian Information Criterion was used to select predictors and develop risk scores for future insulin therapy in the training dataset. Model calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and discrimination was evaluated using the C-index and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) at 1-year and 5-year follow-ups in the test dataset.

**Results:**
Over a median follow-up of 13.2 years among 2,535 indi- viduals with non-insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes (mean [SD] age 57.9 [13.0] years, median [IQR] diabetes duration 3 [1-9] years), 43.7% (n = 1,107) initiated insulin therapy. Independent predictors of future insulin initiation included younger age at diabetes diagnosis, longer diabetes duration, higher HbA1c, higher urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, lower estimated GFR and baseline use of oral glucose-lower- ing drugs. The clinical risk score demonstrated better discrimination (C-index: 0.729, AUC at 1-year: 0.873, AUC at 5-year: 0.817) than fasting plasma C-peptide (C-index: 0.531, AUC at 1-year: 0.521, AUC at 5-year: 0.531), fasting plasma C-peptide-to-glucose ratio (C-index: 0.560, AUC at 1-year: 0.666, AUC at 5-year: 0.586) and HOMA2- %B (C-index: 0.623, AUC at 1-year: 0.748, AUC at 5-year: 0.664) (all <0.001). The addition of fasting beta-cell function markers to the clinical model did not significantly enhance calibration and dis- criminatory power.

**Conclusion:**
Clinical characteristics outperformed fasting beta-cell function markers in predicting insulin therapy initiation in non-insulin- deficient type 2 diabetes. Routine clinical parameters identified early insulin requirement and modulation of glycaemic control and kidney function might delay insulin initiation.

**Background and aims:**
One-third of people with diabetes develop diabetic retinopathy. Considering the alarming prevalence of diabetes, efficient diabetic retinopathy screening programs are needed. Current reliance on doctor-based screening poses economic and time-related challenges. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based image recognition sys- tems could reduce the burden by enabling autonomous and accurate ret- inal assessments. We evaluated AI-based diabetic retinopathy screening in a real-world setting across different ethnic groups in a tertiary care hospital, using human grading as reference, and explored risk factors associated with diabetic retinopathy.

**Materials and methods:**
MONA.health software was previously trained and tested to screen for diabetic retinopathy and macular edema on a multicenter US dataset and a public dataset with images from US and France. We enrolled adults with diabetes at a single academic hospital in Brussels to have retinal images taken without dilation by MONA.health. Referable diabetic retinopathy is defined as moderate non-proliferative or worse, or ungradable images. The system identi- fies patients for referral if the highest predicted value for either eye exceeds the algorithm’s threshold (90% sensitivity). The images were also reviewed by a human grader. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between diabetic retin- opathy and risk factors.

**Results:**
A total of 405 patients, mainly European and North-African Caucasian, were recruited. 52 patients (12.8%) were excluded from the primary analysis due to ungradable images according to the human grader, missing images from small pupils, insufficient quality, technical issues or poor fixation. Referable diabetic retinopathy was identified in 54 patients (15.3%) by human grading and in 59 patients by AI (15.8%). Human grading identified 31 discrepancies with AI, includ- ing 6 false negatives, 4 false positives and 21 ungradable cases. Area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity of AI for referable diabetic retinopathy were 96.5% [91.8-99.7], 88.9% [77.4-95.8] and 98.7% [96.7-99.7], respectively, with no difference between the 2 main eth- nicities. In multivariate analysis, elevated HbA1c at diabetes diagnosis and longer diabetes duration were associated with referable diabetic retinopathy in both AI and human gradings. 83 patients (23.5%) were referred by the human grader for abnormal ocular findings unrelated to diabetic retinopathy, mostly for retinal vascular tortuosity, asymmetric or atrophic optic discs, possible age-related macular degeneration, optic disc hemorrhage or other retinal lesions. Among them, 13 were referred for diabetic retinopathy by AI.

**Conclusion:**
AI-based diabetic retinopathy screening was robust in this cohort, exceeding Food and Drug Administration thresholds for sensitivity and specificity. It showed consistent performance across different ethnic backgrounds and revealed promising generalizability in real-world settings. Additional system training and economic evalu- ation are crucial for establishing effective referral pathways to fully realize its advantages in clinical practice.

**What are the modifiable and unmodifiable hypoglycaemia risk fac- tors for type 2 diabetes patients? Implications for clinical practice**

M.M. Teh

**Background and aims:**
Hypoglycaemia is a significant side effect of treatment of diabetes. It carries significant morbidity and potential mortality. It is possible to study exposure to different levels of hypo- glycaemia robustly with the advent of continuous glucose monitoring system. It is not clear whether there are any differences in factors driv- ing different levels of hypoglycaemia. We aim to elucidate the fac- tors driving different levels of hypoglycaemia among type 2 diabetes patients, using continuous glucose monitoring system.

**Materials and methods:**
Type 2 diabetes patients from a tertiary hospital diabetes clinic were recruited to wear Freestyle Libre Pro IQ sensors (blinded continuous glucose monitoring) for two weeks. Hypoglycaemic events were defined as episodes lasting more than 15 minutes and were categorised using downloaded sensor data. Level 1 hypoglycaemia was defined as glucose levels ≤4.0 mmol/L, while level 2 hypoglycaemia was defined as ≤3.0 mmol/L. Comprehensive clinical data were collected through questionnaire and medical his- tory, including demographics, diabetes duration, treatment regimens, comorbidities, and laboratory parameters such as ­HbA and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Negative binomial regression analy- sis was employed to identify factors associated with both levels of hypoglycaemia, accounting for the potential overdispersion in the data.

**Results:**
We recruited 134 (80 males:54 females, mean age 63.4±11.1 years, mean ­HbA 8.1+1.7%. , mean eGFR 60.3 ± 32.5 mL/min/1.73m² ) . Distribution of subjects according to eGFR is as follows: 58(43.3%) had eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73m², 23(17.2%) had eGFR 45-59 mL/ min/1.73m², 24(17.9%) had eGFR 30-44 mL/min/1.73m², and 29(21.6%) had eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m². Treatment regimens included insulin alone 47(35.1%), sulphonylureas 35 (26.1%), combined insulin and sul- phonylureas 20 (14.9%), and other medications 32 (23.9%).For level 1 hypoglycaemia, univariate analysis identified lower Hba1c (Rate Ratio (RR)0.74, 95% Confidence Interval (CI):0.65-0.83), lower mean glucose (RR 0.69 , 95% CI:0.63-0.74), and retinopathy (RR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36- 0.92) as significant predictors (all p<0.05) while multivariate analysis retained only ­HbA (Adjusted Rate Ratio (ARR) 0.69, 95% CI:0.60- 0.79) and eGFR (ARR 0.99, 95% CI:0.99-1.00) as significant factors. For level 2 hypoglycaemia , longer diabetes duration (RR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.06), lower eGFR (RR 0.99, 95% CI:0.98-1.00), lower ­HbA (RR 0.75, 95% CI:0.65-0.88), lower mean glucose (RR 0.68, 95%CI: 0.61- 0.75), and stroke history (RR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.18-0.97) were significant in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis retained diabetes duration (ARR 1.04, 95% CI:1.02-1.06), eGFR (ARR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-1.00), and ­HbA (ARR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.57-0.78) as significant predictors.

**Conclusion:**
Both modifiable and unmodifiable risk factors play sig- nificant roles in driving level 1 and 2 hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes patients. Among the risk factors involved, the only modifiable risk fac- tor is the degree of glycaemic control. Hence, individualise glycaemic targets in type 2 diabetes patients at high risk of hypoglycaemia such as those with chronic kidney disease or long duration of diabetes is of paramount importance.

**Individuals with higher HbA experience a greater proportion of symptomatic patient reported hypoglycaemia at sensor glucose levels above 4mmol/L: analysis of the Hypo-METRICS study**

J.J.C. Thomas

1. University of Leicester, Leicester, UK, Diabetes Research Centre,

**Background and aims:**
Glycaemic control may impact the threshold at which counter regulatory symptom and hormone responses are generated. Those with elevated HbA1c frequently report symptoms of hypoglycaemia above the glucose threshold for hypoglycaemia (sometimes referred to as pseudo-hypoglycaemia). This analysis aimed to explore the relationship between HbA1c, and the propor- tion of symptomatic patient reported hypoglycaemic episodes that occurred above a sensor glucose threshold of 4.0mmol/L in people with type 1 (PwT1D) and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (PwT2D).

**Materials and methods:**
Data from the Hypo-METRICS study were analysed. HbA1c was measured at baseline and a blinded continu- ous glucose monitor (CGM) was worn for the 10-week study dura- tion. Participants used the HypoMETRICS app to record episodes of symptomatic patient reported hypoglycaemia (PRH), defined as when they experienced symptoms they associated with hypoglycaemia. For each participant, we calculated the proportion of the total number of symptomatic PRH events experienced that were not associated with sensor detected hypoglycaemia (sensor <4mmol/L for at least 15 minutes).

**Results:**
Data were analysed from 513 participants (258 PwT1D). PwT2D were older (63 (14) vs 47 (27)), more likely to be male (62% vs 45%), with similar overall glycaemic control (7.5% (1.5%) vs 7.3% (1.1%)) compared with PwT1D. Using unadjusted linear modelling, in PwT2D, there is a positive association between HbA1c and propor- tion of symptomatic hypoglycaemic without concomitant low sensor glucose values (β = 0.598; P = 0.049). This relationship was not sig- nificant in PwT1D (β= 0.241; P = 0.368). When modelling the effect of diabetes type on HbA1c, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and duration of diabetes, HbA1c and living with T2D was positively associated with the rate of symptomatic PRH experienced without a low glucose value (β = 0.02 and 0.16 respectively, P < 0.01).

**Conclusion:**
These data support the clinical observation that PwD and elevated HbA1c can experience symptoms they associate with hypo- glycaemia at higher hypoglycaemia thresholds compared to PwD with lower levels of HbA1c and that this is more common in PwT2D.

**Background and aims:**
In addition to analog insulin preparations, newly developed technical aids are also part of the modern treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The aim of our study was to compare the neuropathic status and CGM parameters of T1DM patients treated with basal-bolus insulin and using real-time sensors and the Medtronic MiniMed 780G insulin pump with those of patients not using sensors. We also examine the relationship between neuropathy assessments and carbohydrate metabolism parameters in all patients.

**Materials and methods:**
Our study included 58 T1DM patients (22 780G, 19 CGM, 17 control, mean ± SD; age: 34.8±1.74 years; disease duration: 17.1±1.44 years, HbA1c 7.5±0.16%). Autonomic function was assessed using four cardiovascular reflex tests according to Ewing. Comprehensive peripheral neuropathy examinations were conducted using Neurometer (MSB-MET Kft. Balatonfüred), Monofilament, and Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork tests. Control patients used the Medtronic iPro 2 sensor for 6 days, while the 780G and CGM groups used the Medtronic Guardian sensor for 7 days.

**Results:**
In the 780G group, HbA1c was significantly lower com- pared to the control group (780G vs. control: 7.0±0.17 vs. 8.2±0.28%, p<0.001). The heart rate response to deep breathing was significantly more favorable in the 780G group (780G vs. control: 30.4±3.4 vs. 17.9±1.9, p=0.014). Using the Neurometer, the sensory perception threshold (CPT) at 2000 Hz frequency was lower in the 780G group for both the median nerve and peroneal nerve (780G vs. control 2000 Hz median nerve: 204.8±14.6 vs. 298.9±31.4, p=0.005; 2000 Hz peroneal nerve: 324.9±18.2 vs. 492.1±41.7, p=0.002) and in the CGM group (CGM vs. control 2000 Hz median nerve: 206.4±19.2 vs. 298.9±31.4, p=0.017; 2000 Hz peroneal nerve: 301.7±31.6 vs. 492.1±41.7, p=0.002). Across all patients, a positive correlation was found between autonomic neuropathy (AN) and HbA1c (r=0.370, p<0.005). Glucose variability (GV) was significantly associated with lower time in range (TIR) (r=-0.446, p<0.001) and higher HbA1c (r=0.279, p<0.05). Orthostatic blood pressure drop showed a negative correlation with TIR (r=-0.280, p<0.05) and a positive correlation with time above range (TAR) (r=0.318, p<0.05). Increased time below range (TBR) resulted in a higher CPT at 2000 Hz for both the peroneal nerve (r=0.455, p<0.001) and the median nerve (r=0.406, p=0.002). Higher GV was also associated with higher CPT values at 2000 Hz in both the lower (r=0.324, p=0.013) and upper limbs (r=0.278, p=0.035).

**Conclusion:**
Higher GV is associated with more frequent hypoglyce- mia and worsened metabolic control, as reflected by increased HbA1c values. Increased glucose variability and more frequent hypoglycemia also have a negative impact on sensory nervous system function. The severity of AN is more pronounced with higher HbA1c levels and longer time spent outside the target range.

**Background and aims:**
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition has beneficial effects on various metabolic indicators in diabetes. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is expressed in diverse organs including kidneys which is cleaved and inactivated by DPP-4 enzyme.Objectives: This randomized-controlled trial was performed to assess the effect of sitagliptin on diabetic nephropathy when used as an add-on therapy to advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) system in adolescents with T1DM and nephropathy.

**Materials and methods:**
Forty-six adolescents on MiniMed™ 780G system were randomly assigned into two groups; intervention group who received oral sitagliptin 50 mg for three months. The other group used AHCL only and served as a control group.

**Results:**
Both groups were well-matched as regards baseline clini- cal and laboratory characteristics as well as AHCL system settings (p>0.05). Serum SDF-1 levels were higher in all T1DM patients versus healthy controls (p<0.001). After three months, sitagliptin resulted in a significant decrease of SDF-1 levels from 3.58 ± 0.73 to 1.99 ± 0.76 ng/mL (p<0.001), together with improvement of UACR from 7.27 ± 2.41 to 1.32 ± 0.31 mg/mmol (p<0.001). In addition, sitagliptin reduced postprandial glucose, sensor glucose, coefficient of variation and total daily dose of insulin while time in range (TIR) 70-180 mg/ dL and insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio were significantly increased. Sit- agliptin was safe and well-tolerated without severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.

**Conclusion:**
Sitagliptin as an add on therapy to AHCL had a reno- protective effect for T1DM patients with diabetic nephropathy, in addi- tion to the improvement of TIR while reducing glycemic variability without compromising safety.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus is closely associated with cognitive decline, potentially mediated by hippocampal microcircula- tory dysfunction. Recent evidence suggests that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived glycaemic variability exacerbates cognitive impairment in diabetes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate hippocampal haemodynamic and structural alterations using quantitative super- resolution ultrasound imaging and determine their correlation with CGM-quantified glycaemic fluctuations in type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 32 male Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled from the Shanghai Diabetes Institute Inpatient Database. Super-resolution ultrasound imaging was employed to visu- alize the hippocampal microvasculature transcranially. The key param- eters, including mean blood flow velocity, peak blood flow velocity, fractal dimension, vascular density, and vascular tortuosity index, were systematically evaluated using quantitative analytical methods. CGM data were collected retrospectively over 72 hours using a subcutane- ous interstitial glucose sensor. The complexity of glucose time series index (CGI) was measured with refined composite multiscale entropy. Time in range (TIR) was defined as the percentage of time spent within the glucose range of 3.9-10.0 mmol/L over a 24-h period. Moreover, glycaemic variability metrics, including coefficient of variation (CV) and standard deviation (SD) were also calculated.

**Results:**
Comparative analysis between older (≥65 years; n=16) and younger (<65 years; n=16) participants revealed significant differ- ences in hippocampal vascular density ( = 0.029) and peak blood flow velocity ( = 0.009). Linear regression models demonstrated a significant negative association between age and vascular density (β±SE: -0.686±0.243, = 0.008), whereas peak blood flow velocity exhibited a borderline significant decreasing trend with advancing age (β±SE: -0.067±0.036, = 0.068). After adjusting for age, HbA1c, diabetes duration, triglycerides, CV, and SD, mean blood flow veloc- ity exhibited a significant positive correlation with the TIR (β±SE: 0.070±0.021, = 0.004). Furthermore, after adjusting for age, HbA1c, diabetes duration, triglycerides, CV, SD, and TIR, fractal dimension of vascular networks demonstrated a positive correlation with the CGI (β±SE: -0.056±0.024, = 0.037).

**Conclusion:**
This study reveals that CGI and TIR, both assessed by CGM, are associated with hippocampal microvascular haemodynamic and structural alterations in type 2 diabetes, as quantified by super- resolution ultrasound imaging. This technique uncovers capillary-level perturbations linked to glycaemic fluctuations, highlighting the dual roles of glucose stability and dynamic complexity. Longitudinal studies are warranted to validate the prognostic utility of these biomarkers and to advance targeted interventions for mitigating cerebral microvascular deterioration and cognitive decline in diabetes.

**Personalised postprandial glycaemic responses to daily meals and their implications for diabetes prevention: effects of macronutri- ent composition and gut microbiota in a real-world Korean cohort**

S. Ryang

**Background and aims:**
Postprandial glycemic variability plays a criti- cal role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Per- sonalized nutrition based on individual glycemic responses may offer effective strategies for future diabetes prevention and management. However, real-world data on meal-induced glycemic responses and gut microbiota profiles in Korean populations are limited. This study aimed to evaluate personalized glycemic responses to daily meals in individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), prediabetes (PD), and newly diagnosed, drug-naïve T2DM, and further to develop a prac- tical platform for T2DM prevention and self-management.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 525 participants with NGT, PD, or newly diagnosed drug-naïve T2DM (HbA1c 5.0-7.0%) were enrolled. 14-day continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was applied, and daily meals were recorded using a self-developed mobile application. Among them, 348 participants additionally underwent biochemical assess- ments, including a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, lipid profiles, and gut microbiota analysis via stool samples. Incremental area under the curve (iAUC), slope, and peak glucose levels of postprandial glycemic responses were analyzed according to the absolute amounts and proportions of macronutrients from CGM data. Spline curves (df=4) were used to visualize the rela- tionships between nutrient composition and glycemic responses.

**Results:**
In total, 10,689 meals were analyzed. Participants exhibited highly heterogeneous postprandial glycemic responses depending on the macronutrient composition of individual meals, supporting the importance of personalized nutritional strategies. In the sub-group microbiome analysis (n=130), the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila was approximately four-fold higher in the non-diabetes group compared to the diabetes group (1.96% vs. 0.39%, p=0.012). Moreover, CGM-based self-monitoring increased participants’ aware- ness of glycemic control and diabetes prevention.

**Conclusion:**
This study provides real-world evidence of individual- ized glycemic responses and gut microbiota profiles and supports the development of a personalized nutrition platform for T2DM prevention and glycemic control in Korean individuals.

3. USA, Hirsch Consulting, Wyckoff, NJ, USA, Neodyne Biosciences

**Background and aims:**
Besides injection site avoidance, there is no treatment for lipohypertrophy (LH), a common complication of insulin therapy associated with variable, impaired insulin absorption and sub- optimal glycemic control. We investigated whether a tension offloading patch (embrace®, approved to reduce post-incisional scarring) could remodel LH in adults with T1DM.

**Materials and methods:**
Participants with T1DM ≥3 years, aged 18-65, and with ≥2 palpable abdominal LH lesions ≥3 cm in long- est axis as confirmed by ultrasound were recruited in an exploratory single-arm intervention study. Participants self-applied the thin trans- parent adhesive patch (4.7 x 12 cm) every ~10 days over the target lesion for 16 weeks. Volumes of the target and a non-treated compara- tor lesion were assessed by ultrasound at baseline and weeks 8 and 16. Biopsies of target and comparator lesions were taken at week 16 for histological analysis in a blinded fashion. Biopsy sections were stained with Oil Red O (lipids) or picrosirius red (connective tissue/collagen). Picrosirius images had 147 extracellular matrix (ECM) ultrastructural features quantified using an established MATLAB algorithm, and rela- tive fibrosis severity scores were assigned to each specimen based on pseudotime analysis of quantified ECM features.

**Results:**
Of 29 enrolled participants (mean±SD age 46±11 years, dia- betes duration 27±10 years, HbA1c 7.3±0.6%, 4 female, 27 on multiple daily injection, 2 on pump), 27 completed the study. Participant esti- mated average age of both LH lesions was >5 years. Mean target lesion volume decreased from 14.88 mL at baseline to 12.39 mL at 16 weeks (p<0.001), while comparator lesion volume significantly increased by 0.336 mL (p=0.01)(Figure 1A). Histology showed significantly reduced fat content (Oil Red O staining, 6.97 average fold reduction, p=0.001) (Figure 1B) in target lesions, as well as significantly less fibrosis (lower scar grade based on morphology, p=0.023). Out of 332 applications, 13 participants reported a total of 33 site reactions (9.9%), all graded as mild and quickly resolving with no resulting discontinuations.

**Conclusion:**
A tension offloading patch applied for 16 weeks was asso- ciated with a significant 17% decrease in volume of long-standing LH lesions and significantly reduced fibrosis and fat on histology. This easy-to-use, low-risk patch seems promising for use in LH, given the lack of other treatment options. Further research into LH pathobiol- ogy is needed.

2. Australia, Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of
3. Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, Department of Diabetes, Monash

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, resulting in insulin deficiency and lifelong dependence on exog- enous insulin for glucose regulation. Poor glycemic control accelerates vascular complications and unpredicted severe hypoglycaemic episodes, highlighting the need for glucose-responsive insulin therapy. Conventional multiple daily insulin injections pose adherence challenges, necessitat- ing innovative drug delivery strategies. To address this, we developed a biocompatible, glucose-responsive insulin nanopolymer designed for sustained glycemic control and potential kidney protection in diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
A glucose-responsive insulin nanopolymer was synthesized and tested and . For evalua- tion, two diabetic mouse models—STZ-induced T1D (C57BL/6) and Akita (C57BL/6-Ins2-Akita/J)—were used. Diabetic mice (n=4) were administered insulin nanocomplexes, naked insulin, or control nano- particles. Blood glucose levels were monitored post-injection, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed to assess glucose-triggered insulin release. Safety evaluations included histo- logical analysis of the injection site and renal clearance assessment via urine excretion

**Results:**
and studies confirmed the glucose-responsive behavior of the particle. experiments with diabetic animals receiving either naked insulin or insulin nanocomplexes demonstrated that both formulations swiftly lowered blood glucose levels (BGLs) below 200 mg dL ¹. However, unlike naked insulin, the nanocomplex sustained normoglycemia (70-200 mg dL ¹) for several days post- injection, reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. The IPGTT confirmed glucose-triggered insulin release from the nanopolymer. Safety evalu- ations showed no inflammation at the injection site and efficient renal clearance of the particles through urine excretion.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that the developed glucose- responsive nanocomplex holds promise for extended insulin delivery, enhancing glucose control while offering potential kidney protection in diabetes.

4. suu, Finland, The Wellbeing Services County of Ostrobothnia, Vaasa,

**Background and aims:**
Recent pharmaceutical advancements have significantly impacted type 2 diabetes (T2D) treatment guidelines; however, insulin remains essential for managing hyperglycemia. Typi- cally, insulin is added when glycemic targets are unmet with other therapies. In Finland, about 20% of people living with T2D (PwT2D) are on insulin. The Finnish Diabetes Register shows those on insu- lin are overrepresented among people in poor glycemic control. We explored reasons for poor glycemic control among PwT2D on insulin treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from various national health care registries. ICD-9, ICD-10, and ICPC-2 codes and drug purchases were used to identify PwT2D during 2014-2021. Laboratory data were gathered from national patient data repository and university hospital data lakes.

**Results:**
The number of PwT2D increased by 17.5% from 360,563 in 2014 to 423,672 in 2021, while the number of those on insulin increased by only 2.2% from 75,258 to 76,905. In 2021, mean age of PwT2D on insulin was 70 vs. 69 years in the full T2D cohort, whereas insulin users had significantly longer diabetes duration (15 vs. 9 years, p<0.001 for equality). The use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 recep- tor agonists increased and was 1.5 and 2.7 times more common among insulin users than in the full cohort in 2021, respectively. Basal and premix insulin initiations among insulin-naïve declined from 8,209 to 6,631 in 2015-2021. The age at insulin initiation was steady at 69 years in females and 65 in males during the whole study period, but alongside diabetes duration at insulin initiation increased from 6.7 to 7.7 years in females and from 7.5 to 9.0 years in males. Mean HbA1c before insulin initiation increased from 72.5 to 77.0 mmol/ mol (p<0.001 for equality) in females and from 73.7 to 80.6 mmol/ mol (p<0.001 for equality) in males. Increasing trend was seen across age groups, with higher HbA1c levels in younger individuals. Males aged ≤50 years had higher HbA1c than females at insulin initiation, while older groups showed no significant sex differences. Higher pre- initiation HbA1c was linked to higher HbA1c one year later initiation. HbA1c level started to increase within one year after initiation among both sexes.

**Conclusion:**
PwT2D on insulin have longer diabetes duration and use more novel therapeutic agents than PwT2D on average. Insulin treat- ment is initiated at a later stage, potentially due to the increased use of new therapeutic agents. However, this study also highlights growing clinical inertia in insulin initiations, particularly among males ≤50 years of age. More aggressive focus on timely insulin initiation could lead to better long term glycemic control. Sustaining good glycemic control after insulin initiation seems challenging and may require new strategies and therapeutic tools.

3. Denmark, Gistrup, Denmark, Novo Nordisk, Søborg, Denmark, Aal-

**Background and aims:**
The effectiveness of insulin therapy depends on adherence to prescribed regimens. Insulin non-adherence is a major reason why >60% of people with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes do not reach glycemic control. Connected insulin pens enable real-time tracking of insulin administration, offering more precise insights into deviations. This study leveraged data from connected insulin pens to systematically assess and categorize reasons for dose deviations.

**Materials and methods:**
This post-hoc analysis used data from a 12-week multicenter randomized controlled trial involving 331 partici- pants with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin alone or in com- bination with bolus insulin. Participants were telemonitored using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a connected insulin pen, and an activity watch. Insulin dosing data, including timing and dosing size, were recorded via connected insulin pens. Healthcare professionals moni- tored insulin use and reported reasons for deviation from the prescribed dose. Reported reasons were categorized and quantified, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize the findings.

**Results:**
A total of 260 reasons for insulin dose deviations were reported, falling into three categories: (1) actual deviations (n = 101), where par- ticipants intentionally or unintentionally deviated from the prescribed dose (e.g., forgetting to administer insulin or fear of needles); (2) justified deviations (n = 103), where deviations were justified (e.g., adjusting insu- lin due to illness or using a different pen than the connected pen); and (3) device-related deviations (n = 56), where the deviations that resulted from technical issues with the connected pen (e.g., incorrect dose registration or device testing). See Figure 1 for an overview of all reasons.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the complexity of insulin dose devia- tions and underscores the need for a nuanced approach to interpreting adherence data. While some deviations reflect actual deviations, others result from clinical adjustments or device-related factors. Understanding these distinctions and reasons for the deviations is crucial for accurately interpreting insulin dosing data, improving telemonitoring interventions, and optimizing clinical decision-making.

4. mark, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.

**Background and aims:**
Adherence to basal insulin in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is poorly understood. Yet, a comprehensive understanding is prerequisite for tailoring support strategies. This study assessed adherence to basal insulin in people with T2D using insulin injection data from connected insulin pens.

**Materials and methods:**
Basal insulin data was provided from 165 participants in the 12-week randomized controlled DiaMonT-trial. Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of T2D and were treated with insulin. Insulin administration was recorded using connected insulin pens, which automatically logged injection timing and dosage. Daily basal insulin injections for each participant were compared to the dose recommended by healthcare providers. Data were aggregated over 14-day periods. Adherence was quantified through (1) overall adherence, defined as the percentage of doses administered as rec- ommended; (2) the distribution of correct, increased, reduced, and omitted doses; and (3) dose deviation, measured as the percentage deviation from the recommended dose.

**Results:**
Overall adherence levels ranged from 74.1% to 78.3%. Throughout all 14-day periods, increased doses followed by reduced doses were the predominant types of deviations. Additionally, between 2.2% and 4.1% of doses were omitted. See Figure 1 for the distribution of correct, reduced, increased, and omitted doses in each 14-day period. For increased and reduced doses, the average extent of deviation from the recommended dose was 3.9% (standard deviation: 23.7%), with most deviations within ±25% of the recom- mended dose. Notably, 14.5% of participants (n = 24) made daily adjustments to their basal insulin dose without prior recommendation from a healthcare provider.

**Conclusion:**
Leveraging data from connected insulin pens, this study provided detailed insights into basal insulin adherence behavior in people with type 2 diabetes. These insights are necessary for enhanc- ing adherence and health outcomes, including glycemic control.

**Background and aims:**
Soli-CGM was a 16-week, single-arm, open- label study that utilised continuous glucose monitoring to assess the efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi (insulin glargine 100 U/mL + lixi- senatide), in adults with T2D (HbA1c ≥9-<13%), receiving ≥2 oral antihyperglycemic drugs ± a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. This post hoc analysis of Soli-CGM evaluated outcomes with iGlarLixi by baseline HbA1c (<9%, ≥9%-<10%, ≥10%) and diabetes duration (<10 years, ≥10 years).

**Materials and methods:**
For each subgroup, the mean change in per- centage of time in range (TIR; 70-180 mg/dL), time below range (TBR; <70 mg/dL) and time above range (TAR; >180 mg/dL) from baseline to Week 16 (α=0.05) was assessed. The percentage of people with TIR >70% at Week 16, and American Diabetes Association (ADA) Level 1, 2 and 3 hypoglycemia events during follow-up were also assessed.

**Results:**
Overall, 124 adults were enrolled (mean age: 55.6 years; male: 58.9%). iGlarLixi demonstrated statistically significant (P<0.05) improvement in TIR across all subgroups, except for baseline HbA1c <9% (P=0.1094); however, the size of this subgroup was small (n=17). No ADA Level 3 hypoglycemia events were reported; the incidence of Level 1 and 2 varied by subgroup. The results are presented in Table 1.

**Conclusion:**
In adults with T2D, iGlarLixi improved the TIR without ADA Level 3 hypoglycemia, regardless of baseline HbA1c or diabetes duration.

IDegLira, a fixed-ratio combination of insu- lin degludec and liraglutide, is indicated for type 2 diabetes (T2D) treatment. This study aimed to investigate glycemic control in Chinese adults with T2D receiving IDegLira in real-world clinical practice.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective, single-arm, cohort study used data from a regional electronic health record. Adult T2D patients who were prescribed IDegLira between March 5, 2022, and June 30, 2024, were included (N=12,103). Changes in clinical parameters from baseline after 180 days of continuous IDegLira treatment were ana- lyzed. The primary endpoint was the change in ­HbA , while secondary endpoints included changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postpran- dial glucose (PPG), and daily insulin dose. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on prior therapy, ­HbA levels, age, fasting C-peptide, and daily insulin dose to assess ­HbA change in different subgroups.

**Results:**
Among 1,159 patients with continuous IDegLira treat- ment, ­HbA decreased from 8.45% at baseline to 7.38% at day 180, a reduction of 1.08% (p<0.001). The proportion of patients achieving ­HbA <7% increased from 17.3% to 41.2% (p<0.001). FPG decreased by 2.34 mmol/L (p<0.001) from 9.90 mmol/L to 7.56 mmol/L, and PPG decreased by 2.10 mmol/L (p<0.001) from 11.91 mmol/L to 9.81 mmol/L. Daily insulin dose was reduced by 4.00 U (p<0.001), from 32.71 U to 28.71 U. Based on baseline characteristics, signifi- cant ­HbA reductions were observed across subgroups (Figure). Higher baseline ­HbA levels were associated with greater reductions in ­HbA (p for trend<0.001). The incidence of hypoglycemia during IDegLira treatment did not differ significantly from baseline (p=0.643).

**Conclusion:**
In real-world clinical practice in China, T2D patients on IDegLira showed significant improvements in glycemic control. Reductions in ­HbA were observed across subgroups, with greater reductions in patients who had higher baseline ­HbA levels.

**Background and aims:**
Maintaining glycaemic control when de-inten- sifying insulin therapy is key to prevent the need for rescue therapy and long-term complications in adults with T2D. This post hoc analysis of Soli-SWITCH assessed glycaemic parameters up to Week 12 after switching from premixed insulin (PI) to iGlarLixi (insulin glargine 100 U/mL + lixisenatide).

**Materials and methods:**
Soli-SWITCH was a Phase 4, 24-week, sin- gle-arm study. Participants included adults with T2D switched from once- or twice-daily PI to once-daily iGlarLixi at baseline. The mean change in HbA1c, mean 7-point self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) from baseline to Week 12, weekly mean fasting SMPG and mean daily insulin dose to Week 12 were assessed.

**Results:**
A total of 162 participants received iGlarLixi. Least squares mean change (LSMC) in HbA1c from baseline (8.5%) to Week 12 was -1.2% (95% CI, -1.3, -1.1). From baseline (184.0 mg/dL) to Week 12, LSMC in mean 7-point SMPG was -44.5 mg/dL (95% CI -48.9, -40.0). A mean fasting SMPG target of 80-130 mg/dL, recommended by the American Diabetes Association, was met at Week 3 and continued to improve to Week 12 (Figure 1). Mean daily insulin doses from screen- ing to Week 12 are shown in Figure 1.

**Conclusion:**
In adults with T2D who switched from PI to iGlarLixi, glycaemic control improved in the first weeks of transitioning (Weeks 0-3) and continued to improve to Week 12.

**Background and aims:**
Soli-SWITCH was a single-arm study that assessed the efficacy and safety of once-daily iGlarLixi (insulin glar- gine 100 U/mL + lixisenatide) in adults with T2D switching from once- or twice-daily PI. Two iGlarLixi pens were available, the 2:1 pen and 3:1 pen, to allow titration up to 60 dose-steps. The aim of this post hoc analysis of Soli-SWITCH was to assess glycaemic outcomes by iGlarLixi pen subgroup.

**Materials and methods:**
Data were analysed by iGlarLixi pen sub- group, defined by the pen participants used most during the study. At baseline (BL), participants initiated either the 2:1 pen or 3:1 pen depending on their previous total PI dose (dose adjustable dur- ing study). Mean change in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial glucose (PPG) and percentage of participants without glycaemic control deterioration from BL to Week 24 were assessed.

**Results:**
The study evaluated glycaemic outcomes for 2:1 and 3:1 pen formulations over 24 weeks. A total of 162 participants from the Czech Republic, Korea, Poland, and Turkey were included. Base- line characteristics differed between pen subgroups, including BMI (Table 1). The LS mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 was identical for both groups −1.2% (95% CI: −1.4 to −1.0). However, the LS mean change in FPG from baseline to Week 24 was greater for the 3:1 pen formulation −49.2 mg/dL (95% CI: −57.4 to −41.1) compared to the 2:1 pen formulation −40.5 mg/dL (95% CI: −48.6 to −32.4). The LS mean change in PPG from baseline to Week 24 was similar for both pens: −67.0 mg/dL (95% CI: −78.9 to −55.1) for the 2:1 pen and −68.6 mg/dL (95% CI: −76.2 to −61.0) for the 3:1 pen. A higher proportion of participants in the 2:1 group (86.2%, 95% CI: 74.6 to 93.9) maintained glycaemic control without dete- rioration compared to the 3:1 group (79.8%, 95% CI: 70.5 to 87.2).

**Conclusion:**
In people with T2D switching from PI, glycaemic improvements were similar across iGlarLixi pen subgroups, despite differences in BL characteristics. This highlights the flexibility of iGlarLixi to adapt to insulin dose needs and optimise Lixi dosage.

**Background and aims:**
The Soli-D study demonstrated better gly- caemic control and body weight (BW) benefits with iGlarLixi, a fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine 100 U/mL + lixisenatide, vs a fixed-ratio of insulin degludec + insulin aspart (IDegAsp) at 24 weeks in Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) suboptimally controlled with glucose-lowering oral agents (OADs). This partic- ipant-level exploratory analysis investigated the impact of the time of injection on clinical outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
The efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi vs IDe- gAsp were analysed by injection time of iGlarLixi (before breakfast; n=291) vs. IDegAsp subgroups (before breakfast [BB]; n=139, lunch [BL]; n=54 or dinner [BD]; n=98) in the Soli-D study. Mean change in glycaemic endpoints, BW and total insulin dose from baseline to Week 24 (W24) and hypoglycaemia event rates were assessed.

**Results:**
Mean ­HbA reductions from baseline were significantly greater with iGlarLixi (least squares mean [LSM] ± SEM change at W24: −1.88 ± 0.05%) vs. IDegAsp at BL (−1.64 ± 0.11%) and at BD (−1.59 ± 0.08%) and numerically better with iGlarLixi vs IDegAsp at BB (−1.76 ± 0.07%) at W24 (Table). At W24, iGlarLixi provided higher rates of ­HbA <53 mmol/mol (<7%) achievement (72.5% vs. 61.2% [IDegAsp BB], vs. 59.3% [IDegAsp BL] and vs. 58.2% [IDeg- Asp BD]). iGlarLixi had BW benefits and lower insulin doses vs. all IDegAsp subgroups. Further, the 2-h postprandial glucose (2-h PPG) after each meal, assessed using seven-point self-monitored plasma glu- cose, achieved the target of <10 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL) and the average 2-h PPG reduction were greater with iGlarLixi vs. all IDegAsp sub- groups. Event rates of any hypoglycaemia (ADA Level 1, 2, or 3) were numerically lower with iGlarLixi vs. IDegAsp across all subgroups (iGlarLixi: 1.90 events per participant-year [PY]; IDegAsp BB: 2.82 per PY [RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.47, 1.04]; IDegAsp BL: 2.01 per PY [RR 0.89; 0.50, 1.58]); IDegAsp BD 2.96 per PY [RR 0.66; 0.43, 1.03]).

**Conclusion:**
iGlarLixi injected before breakfast demonstrated bet- ter ­HbA and average 2-h PPG control compared with IDegAsp in T2D Chinese adults suboptimally controlled with OADs, regardless of IDegAsp injection time, while also providing better overall glycaemic control and BW benefits with lower insulin doses and less hypogly- caemia risk.

2. ven, Leuven, Belgium, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Boston,

**Background and aims:**
Despite using continuous glucose monitor- ing (CGM), people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) may still experience impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) and severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs). Glycemic management and persistence of SHEs in peo- ple with IAH and recurrent SHEs using CGM are not well described. This study assessed elimination of SHEs and proportion of people meeting glycemic targets in individuals with T1D who have IAH + ≥2 annualized SHEs who had been using CGM for at least 12 months.

**Materials and methods:**
Data of participants were pooled from 3 CGM trials: RESCUE (real-time CGM [rtCGM] in insulin pump users), FUTURE (intermittently scanned CGM [isCGM]), and ALERTT1 (rtCGM) trials. Adults living with T1D for at least 1 year who had a history of IAH, and who had HbA1c value of 6.0% to 9.5% and ≥2 annualized SHEs in the first 12 months of CGM use in the trial were included in this analysis. The index date was defined as 12 months after start of CGM in the respective trial. SHEs were self-reported and required third party assistance for recovery. IAH was assessed based on self-report, physician medical record review, or Clarke score ≥4. The primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of participants who did not have SHEs and had HbA1c <7.0% at 12 months of follow- up from the index date. Only individuals with data at the index date were included in this analysis. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or proportion for individuals with evaluable data for each respective outcome.

**Results:**
Forty-nine individuals met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 54.2% were male, with a mean age of 46.9 ± 13.9 years, and 53.1% had a post-secondary education. The duration of T1D was 29.3 ± 14.1 years. At 12 months after index, 13.8% (4/29) achieved the pri- mary endpoint of no SHEs and HbA1c value <7.0%. HbA1c values did not change from index (7.5 ± 0.8%; n=49) to 12 months after index (7.5 ± 0.7%; n=30). Total daily insulin use remained consist- ent between index and 12 months after index (0.54 ± 0.18 U/kg [n=39] and 0.52 ± 0.18 U/kg [n=33], respectively). CGM metrics (time spent in specified range) at index (n = 45) and 12 months after index (n=35) were similar: time in range (TIR; 70 to 180 mg/dL) 55.1 ± 13.1% and 57.1 ± 12.8%, time above range (>180 mg/dL) 36.6 ± 14.0% and 35.9 ± 12.0%, and time below range (<70 mg/ dL) 8.0 ± 6.9% and 6.7 ± 5.5%, respectively. Hospitalizations due to SHEs or diabetic ketoacidosis were rare and comparable at index and 12 months after index.

**Conclusion:**
In this study, the vast majority of people with T1D who had recurrent SHEs with IAH using CGM continued to experience SHEs and did not meet glycemic targets (TIR or HbA1c), highlight- ing the need for novel therapeutic approaches in T1D.

**Exploring factors that affect the proportion of sensor hypoglycae- mic events <3.9mmol/l that become level 2, in type 1 and insulin- treated type 2 diabetes: Hypo-METRICS study**

**Background and aims:**
Level 2 (L2<3.0mmol/L) hypoglycaemia is associated with adverse clinical outcomes if not treated promptly. We investigated the proportion of L2 sensor-detected hypoglycaemic (SDH) episodes over the total number of events in type 1 (T1D) and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (T2D), adjusting for effect factors.

**Materials and methods:**
Using data from Hypo-METRICS, where participants wore blinded continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGM) for 10 weeks, we defined SDH as ≥15min below threshold. Potential effects of age, sex, ethnicity, mean SDH duration per partici- pant, impaired hypoglycaemic awareness (IAH) Gold ≥4, mean number of weekly SDH episodes, mean glucose, CV%, and CGM usage were assessed via purposeful variable selection. The association between L2 ratio and the selected effect factors was analysed with beta regression.

**Results:**
We analysed data from 247 people with T1D (PwT1D) and 224 PwT2D: median age=48yr vs. 62yr, median HbA1c=56mmol/ mol vs. 58mmol/mol, CGM use=39% vs. 19%, IAH=11% for both groups. We only included participants with ≥70% active data from ≥14 days of blinded CGM wear and ≥1 L2 hypoglycaemic episode during the aforementioned period. Across T1D and T2D, we recorded 27,072 SDH events; of these 4,308/19,003=23% became L2 in T1D and 1,311/8069=16% became L2 in T2D. Mean glucose (OR=1.15, p<0.001), mean SDH duration (OR=1.01, p<0.001) and mean weekly SDH rate (OR=1.07, p<0.001) had a significant effect on the pro- portion of SDH<3.9mmol/L that became L2. Mean glucose and mean SDH duration were important effect factors in T1D vs. T2D: mean glucose OR=1.16 vs. OR=1.11, p<0.001; mean SDH duration OR=1.02 vs. OR=1.01, p<0.001. Mean weekly number of SDH events (OR=1.08, p<0.001) affected the L2 SDH proportion only in T1D, and age (OR=0.99, p<0.001) only in T2D.

**Conclusion:**
A third of hypoglycaemic events became L2 in both T1D and T2D. Mean glucose and mean SDH duration slightly increased the proportion of L2 SDH events in both T1D and T2D. Mean weekly number of SDH episodes was associated with more L2 events in T1D, whilst age was marginally associated with L2 episodes in T2D. Inter- estingly, awareness status, CGM usage, or CV% had no association with sensor hypoglycaemia events becoming L2 in either T1D or T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Interstitial glucose concentrations are gaining clinical relevance with advances in real-time continuous glucose moni- tors (CGM), as they more closely reflect glucopaenia in cerebral and cardiac tissues. We therefore studied interstitial vs. arterialised-venous (AV) glucose differences during experimental hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

**Materials and methods:**
All participants in study underwent hyperin- sulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamps to achieve AV glucose of 2.5 ± 0.5 mmol/L for 60 minutes as measured with YSI 2500 glucose analyser (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Interstitial glucose measured with Dexcom G6 (Dexcom, CA) [CGM] was compared with time-matched AV whole blood glucose measured using YSI [YSI] and CareSens glucometer (Spirit Healthcare, UK) [GM] during pre-hypo, hypogly- caemia, and post-hypo. Capillary blood glucose (CBG) measured with CareSens glucometer, was also compared post-hypo with CGM.

**Results:**
Data from n=22 adults (14 males; mean [SD] HbA1c 64.1[12] mmol/mol) were included in the analysis. Mean differences (95% CI) between CGM vs. YSI were 1.1 (0.5, 1.8; p<0.001), 0.9 (0.5, 1.3; p<0.001), and -0.2 mmol/L (-0.8, 0.5; p=0.636) during pre-hypo, hypoglycaemia, and post-hypo periods, respectively (figure 1). For GM vs. YSI, the mean differences were 0.7 (0.3, 1.0; p=0.001), 0.4 (0.2, 0.5; p<0.001), and 0.7 mmol/L (0.3, 1.1; p<0.001) during pre- hypo, hypoglycaemia, and post-hypo, respectively. During the post- hypo period, mean difference for CGM vs. CBG was 0.2 mmol/L (-0.4, 0.8; p=0.5).

**Conclusion:**
CGM and GM readings exceeded YSI during hypoglyce- mia, while CGM matched CBG post-hypo. We need further research to establish clinical implications of this difference between readings. There was also a physiological lag of CGM values post-hypo.

**Background and aims:**
Increased glycemic variability is a recognized independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. However, most pub- lications on this topic focus on patients with diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs) provide much more precise data on daily glycemic variability than self-moni- toring with glucometers. In this interventional study using oral sema- glutide, we assess glycemic variability parameters recorded by CGM in patients with prediabetes and obesity and evaluate the impact of this intervention on glycemic stability. The study aimed to determine the effect of oral semaglutide on glycemic variability using continuous glucose monitoring system data.

**Materials and methods:**
The study analyzed CGM records from before and at the end of treatment for the first 100 patients with com- plete CGM data (more than 7 days of activity) from the GAROS project (Genetics of Acute Response to Oral Semaglutide study). Among the participants, 36 had isolated impaired fasting glucose (iIFG), 14 had both impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance (IFG+IGT), 8 had isolated impaired glucose tolerance (iIGT), and 42 were normoglycemic. Patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30/kg/m2) or BMI > 27 kg/m2 with coexisting prediabetes were included. A 3-month intervention with gradually increasing doses of oral semaglutide (from 3 mg to 42 mg/day) was implemented. CGM sensors were applied at four time points during the study: before treatment, after one month, after three months of treatment, and three months after treatment dis- continuation. Freestyle Libre CGM sensors (Abbott) were used in the study. Parameters (CV, MODD, MAGE, eHbA1c) from CGM records before and after treatment were compared using paired t-tests and Wil- coxon tests (JASP and R-studio software).

**Results:**
Significant reductions in glycemic variability parameters (CV, MODD, MAGE) were observed following the pharmacological intervention (p < 0.001). Most significant CV reductions were found in the iIGT group, from 17.43 (± 3.90)% to 13.87 (± 4.13)%.Most con- siderable reductions in MODD, MAGE, and eHbA1c were found in the IFG+IGT group. The mean eHbA1c in the study group decreased from 5.32 (± 0.32)% to 4.98 (± 0.29)%. The time spent below the tar- get range (<70 mg/dL) increased from 1.16% to 2.34%, but without a significant increase in the risk of clinically relevant hypoglycemia (<54mg/dl; p=0.13).

**Conclusion:**
The use of oral semaglutide in patients with prediabetes and/or obesity is associated with improved glycemic control indicators and reduced daily glycemic variability. Notably, the risk of clinically relevant hypoglycemia did not significantly increase. CGMs are a good tool for monitoring glycemia in patients with prediabetes or obesity.

4. ver, CO, USA, NA HEOR, Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA.

**Background and aims:**
Many studies have found that CGM can improve glycemic control and is associated with lower risk of acute dia- betic events (ADEs; hypoglycemia and DKA) among people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) not on insulin therapies, compared to SMBG. Hos- pitalizations and emergency room (ER) visits are major contributors of diabetes-related healthcare costs, which constitute a substantial portion of overall healthcare expenditure in the United States (US). Currently, Medicaid reimbursements for CGM comprise those limited to patients only on intensive insulin therapies in some states to reimbursement for patients on any insulin therapies in other states. This budget impact analysis explored the financial impact of CGM reimbursement for all adults living with T2DM including insulin and non-insulin therapies who are beneficiaries of Medicaid across all states in the US.

**Materials and methods:**
This analysis explored the financial impact over a three-year timespan from a Medicaid perspective covering approximately 72 million lives. It compared the budget difference in annual total costs between a reference scenario where only peo- ple using any insulin therapies are covered and a reimbursed scenario where CGM coverage is expanded to include people on non-insulin therapies. Prevalence estimates of T2DM in the Medicaid population were adjusted for people under age 65 years. Direct costs associated with glucose monitoring, all-cause inpatient hospital (ACH) visits, and acute, diabetic events requiring emergency room (ER) visits were included. Difference in event rates reduction of ACH associated with CGM when compared to SMBG is 1.5 events for multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) users, 0.6 events for basal insulin users, and 0.4 events in non-insulin users. For acute, diabetes-related ER visits, the differ- ence in event rates reduction associated with CGM when compared to SMBG is 2.4 events in MDI users, 1.1 events for basal insulin users, and 0.7 events in non-insulin users. Market shares of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and CGM in the reference and reimbursed scenarios were assumed. Healthcare resource utilization rates for CGM and SMBG users were based on analysis of a large, real-world, com- mercial database published in 2024. All costs were adjusted to 2025 $USD.

**Results:**
From a Medicaid perspective, expansion of CGM reimburse- ment to all patients with T2DM including non-insulin therapy, when projected at a 15% increase in CGM users from the previous year, was associated with a net savings of $366 million in year 1, $542 million in year 2, $761 million in year 3, with a cumulative cost savings of $1.7 billion with 143,000 hospitalizations avoided over 3 years. These net savings are largely due to inpatient hospitalizations avoided when a patient switches from SMBG to CGM use. One-way sensitivity analysis identified ACH in patients not using insulin with SMBG as the major cost driver.

**Conclusion:**
At $12,880 per ACH stay among patients with T2DM, all-cause hospitalization was the major cost-driver on Medicaid’s budget. CGM coverage for beneficiaries with T2DM including those on non-insulin therapy resulted in cost savings from the perspective of Medicaid in the US.

1. Dexcom, San Diego, CA, USA, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.

**Background and aims:**
Clinical studies show that real-time continu- ous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) improves glycemic outcomes in people with T2D who are on insulin therapy (T2D IT). We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing RT-CGM with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) from the Japanese public payor perspective.

**Materials and methods:**
Using the IQVIA Core Diabetes Model ver- sion 10.0, we projected lifetime clinical outcomes and direct medical costs from the perspective of the Japanese public healthcare payer. Cohort characteristics were obtained from a clinical trial that included Japanese patients with T2D. Clinical parameters included a HbA1c reduction of 0.9% favoring RT-CGM, severe hypoglycemic events rates of 0.04 and 0 Per Person-Year (PPY) for SMBG and RT-CGM, respec- tively, and DKA rates of 0.025 and 0 PPY, respectively. Cardiovascular events were modeled using the Japan Public Health Center-based pro- spective (JPHC) Study Cohort II risk equations. Complication costs were sourced from the published literature, and RT-CGM and SMBG costs (average 1.6 tests/day) were based on the reimbursement tables of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour. Utilities for avoidance of finger sticks (0.03) and fear of hypoglycemia reduction (0.025) were applied to RT-CGM. Sensitivity analyses included vary- ing age at RT-CGM initiation and the use of alternative cardiovascular risk equations.

**Results:**
The model projected RT-CGM users to have higher quality- adjusted life years (QALY) by 1.501, incremental costs of JPY 500,192, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of JPY 333,150, which is below the willingness to pay threshold (WTP) of JPY 5,000,000/QALY. The relative reduction in the total number of events due to RT-CGM use for diabetes eye, renal, neuropathy, and cardiovascular complications was 24%, 31%, 10%, and 6% respec- tively. Using the UKPDS 82 cardiovascular risk equation yielded lower incremental QALYs (1.346) and costs (JPY 440,413), with an ICER of JPY 326,644/QALY. Age at initiation significantly influenced cost-effectiveness: initiating RT-CGM at age 35 led to 2.285 QALYs gained and lower incremental costs (JPY 280,747), with an ICER of JPY 122,849/QALY. In contrast, initiation at age 75 yielded 0.816 QALYs and incremental costs of JPY 350,202, resulting in an ICER of JPY 429,274/QALY. All sensitivity analyses remained well below the WTP threshold for Japan.

**Conclusion:**
Our analysis suggests that RT-CGM is more cost-effective than SMBG in individuals with T2D IT in Japan and it may reduce acute and chronic complications of diabetes. These findings could inform decision makers regarding the economic value of rt-CGM for this population.

**Early experiences with Stelo: real-world behavioural and glycaemic outcomes in users with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, or no diabetes**

M. Crawford

**Background and aims:**
The Stelo Glucose Biosensor offers real-time glucose data and insights to individuals not on insulin, with or without diabetes. This study assessed early user experiences to evaluate the impact of real-time glucose monitoring on glycemic outcomes and behavior in users with no diabetes (ND), prediabetes (PreD), or Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) during the first 30 days of Stelo use.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed real-world data from users dur- ing their first 30 days using Stelo, along with survey responses on behavioral intentions, reflections, and changes. Demographics, glyce- mic metrics, and engagement data including behavior logging (BL) to contextualize spike notifications were analyzed over 30 days by user subgroups and stratified by median BL engagement. Changes were compared between the first and last 10 days.

**Results:**
Sample included 481 users (38% aged 65+ years; 49% female; BMI 29 ± 6 kg/m ; 29% ND, 26% PreD, 45% T2D). Mean glucose increased progressively from ND to T2D (30-day mean ± SD mg/dL: 108 ± 15, 116 ± 17, 145 ± 28), while TIR 70-120 mg/ dL declined (80 ± 19, 67 ± 23, 30 ± 26) (all p<0.001). TIR was high across user groups; PreD and T2D users showed the most improve- ments over time, with TIR increases over wear period, trends that, while not statistically significant, are noteworthy. TIR was signifi- cantly higher among users with above-median BL engagement than those with below-median engagement (88 ± 18 vs 93 ± 14; p<0.05). While all users prioritized glucose monitoring and diet, ND and PreD users more often pursued sleep, stress, and activity goals (p<0.05). Users reported increased knowledge and confidence around health management, and positive changes in diet, activity, and weight management.

**Conclusion:**
Stelo supported behavior change and improved physical health and psychological well-being across populations with diverse glycemic patterns. These findings support its broader use in lifestyle and metabolic health management.

**Background and aims:**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have the potential to improve risk prediction by iden- tifying complex patterns in clinical and laboratory data, surpassing traditional approaches. ML has already shown success in detecting metabolic diseases, including Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). How- ever, the ability to accurately forecast T2DM incidence is even more beneficial, enabling earlier interventions and treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
This observational study aimed to leverage ML to predict the 4-year risk of developing T2DM. A cohort of 904 cardiovascular risk patients, initially free of T2DM, was analyzed at baseline, with data including anthropometric measurements, clinical and laboratory parameters, and recent metabolic biomarkers. Over four years of follow-up, 10.2% of the patients developed T2DM.

**Results:**
The ML approach, utilizing the Caret package in R, applied 50 variables. Patients were randomly split into training and test cohorts (75:25), with oversampling used to address class imbalance in T2DM incidence. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was employed to iden- tify the most relevant variables. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel demonstrated the most promising predictive performance, achieving a balanced accuracy of 73%, a sensitivity of 74%, a specificity of 71%, and an AUC of 0.727. The top-ranked pre- dictors for T2DM were glucose measurements (2- hour OGTT glucose, fasting glucose, and HbA1c), HDL-cholesterol, and the triglyceride- glucose (TyG) index.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, ML proves to be a valuable tool for iden- tifying individuals at risk of T2DM, paving the way for personalized medicine through earlier diagnosis and tailored interventions.

**Background and aims:**
The rise of Big Data necessitates artificial intelligence-driven analyses to extract valuable insights, particularly for risk prediction in high-risk patient populations. This observational study applied machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict 5-year overall mortality in heart failure patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or prediabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
A cohort of 290 heart failure patients with T2DM or prediabetes was followed for 5 years, during which 54% of participants died. The dataset comprised 470 variables, e.g. anthropo- metric, clinical, social, family history, and lifestyle factors. After pre- processing, the data were analyzed using ML techniques implemented in R’s caret package. The dataset was split into training (75%) and test (25%) subsets.

**Results:**
Among the ML models tested, the Random Forest algorithm demonstrated the best predictive performance, with a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 89%, and overall accuracy of 85%. Clinical param- eters were the most significant predictors, with the multimorbidity marker Glypican-4, hemoglobin, and glomerular filtration rate identi- fied as the top three contributors.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, ML-based Big Data analysis holds great potential for predicting mortality risk in pre-/diabetic heart failure patients, paving the way for personalized and timely interventions.

4. Denmark, Novo Nordisk, Søborg, Denmark.

**Background and aims:**
Telemonitoring in diabetes care has evolved significantly over the past few decades, showing positive trends in terms of glycaemic control. Despite this evolution, there is limited knowledge about the effect of telemonitoring on patient-reported out- comes such as general and diabetes-specific quality of life (QoL) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In particular, the population of insulin-dependent T2D remains underexplored in relation to the impact of telemonitoring on QoL. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of telemonitoring on diabetes-specific QoL com- pared with usual care in people with insulin-dependent T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Data for this study was provided from a Dan- ish multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial with a duration of three months (DiaMonT). People with insulin-dependent T2D were randomized (1:1) to either telemonitoring or usual care. The telem- onitoring group tracked their health data at home using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a connected insulin pen, an activity tracker and smartphone applications throughout the study period. Hospital staff monitored the telemonitoring group to support insulin dosing deci- sions and provided regular phone contact. The usual care group used a blinded connected insulin pen throughout the trial and a blinded CGM during the first and final 20 days of the trial, but their data was not monitored by hospital staff. Change from baseline in diabetes-specific QoL was measured using the 6-item DAWN2 Impact of Diabetes Pro- file (DIDP), with lower scores indicating better QoL. Normality of data was determined with Anderson-Darling-test. Mann Whitney U-test was conducted to assess differences between groups and Wilcoxon Signed Rank-test was performed to assess within-group differences.

**Results:**
From the total of 331 participants in the trial, 315 participants (159 in the telemonitoring group and 156 in the usual care group) were included in the analyses. Reasons for exclusion were drop out (n = 11) or missing valid DIDP scores (n = 5). The telemonitoring group showed a statistically significant reduction in DIDP scores compared with the usual care group (median change: -0.03 [IQR: -0.60 to 0.33] vs. 0.00 [IQR: -0.35 to 0.50], p = 0.015) (Figure 1). Within-group analysis showed a significant improvement in the telemonitoring group (p = 0.027, r = 0.19, 95% CI [-0.36; -0.02], but no significant change in the usual care group (p = 0.36, r = 0.08, 95% CI [-0.25; 0.09].

**Conclusion:**
The results indicate a small but significant effect of telem- onitoring over usual care in improving diabetes-specific QoL in people with insulin-dependent T2D. The magnitude of the difference suggests that the effect may not be clinically meaningful but a minimal clinically important difference for DIDP has not been establish, which limits the interpretation of clinical relevance.

**Background and aims:**
Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven digital health is revolutionizing endocrinology by enhancing patient outcomes, reducing the burden of managing chronic disease, and ultimately improving patients’ quality of care. This work leverages novel technol- ogy for automatic, accurate meal detection and carbohydrate quantity estimation using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, enabling a reliable and comprehensive view of carbohydrate intake, glucose levels, and insulin injection data. A novel AI-based algorithm analyzes bolus injection events and missed bolus opportunities while identifying bolus injection patterns. This work evaluated the level of agreement on insulin dose, timing adjustments, and missed bolus opportunities between experienced endocrinologists and the AI-based tool.

**Materials and methods:**
This non-interventional retrospective data analysis assessed CGM and bolus records for 25 participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Three experienced endocrinologists analyzed the insulin dose and timing of each bolus and identified missed bolus opportunities and recurring patterns. Results were compared with an AI-based tool. A 1-tailed, noninferiority test was used to assess whether the agreement between experts and the AI algorithm was non-inferior to the agreement between pairs of experts. The IQR of the level of agreement between experts was used as the noninferiority margin. The null hypothesis was that the agreement between AI and experts was inferior to the agree- ment between pairs of experts. Data are shown as mean ± SD.

**Results:**
For analysis of bolus events, the level of agreement on the direction of insulin bolus dose and timing adjustments among experts was 81% ± 12% and 79% ± 17%, respectively, while the agreement between the AI algorithm and the experts was 73% ± 13% and 83% ± 15%, respectively (Fig. 1A). When analyzing missed bolus opportuni- ties, the level of agreement among experts was 44% ± 20%, while the agreement between the AI algorithm and the experts was 48% ± 18% (Fig. 1B). For insulin injection pattern analysis, the level of agreement on the direction of the insulin dose and timing pattern among experts was 95% ± 4% and 91% ± 11%, respectively, while the agreement between the AI algorithm and the experts was 95% ± 4% and 92% ± 12%, respectively (both <0.05).

**Conclusion:**
This study found that the level of agreement between experts and the AI algorithm was comparable to the agreement among the physicians themselves, demonstrating the potential of the AI tool in everyday practice. The AI tool’s recommendations for insulin dose and timing adjustments were non-inferior to those given by experienced physicians, suggesting its utility as a decision-support tool for manag- ing patients with T1D on MDI therapy.

2. Türkiye, Endocrinology Department, Bilkent City Hospital, Ankara,

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes is a complex chronic condition requir- ing personalized treatment. Standard guidelines commonly used often fail to adequately address individual variations. This study aims to develop DiabetAid, an AI-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) pro- viding personalized diabetes treatment recommendations based on com- prehensive patient data, including laboratory results and demographics.

**Materials and methods:**
The DiabetAid system predicts personalized treatment combinations represented as binary strings of length 16, cor- responding to 16 distinct drug types: Metformin, Sulfonylurea, Glinide, Thiazolidinedione (TZD), Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitor, GLP-1 Recep- tor Agonist, DPP-4 Inhibitor, SGLT-2 Inhibitor, Short/Rapid-Acting Insulin, Long-Acting Insulin, Mixed Insulin, Metformin + TZD, Met- formin + DPP-4 Inhibitor, Metformin + SGLT-2 Inhibitor, Short-Act- ing Insulin + Long-Acting Insulin, and Long-Acting Insulin + GLP-1 Receptor Agonist. Treatments are generated by selecting appropriate combinations among these drugs. The dataset used for model develop- ment and evaluation consists of 16,655 patient records. To evaluate prediction accuracy, a Custom Jaccard Score was utilized, measuring the similarity between true and predicted treatment combinations. For each position in the binary strings, a matching bit adds 1 to both intersection and union, whereas a differing bit adds 0 to the intersection and 2 to the union. The Jaccard score for each prediction is calculated as the ratio of intersection to union, with the final score being the average of all predictions. Additionally, predictions were reviewed by endocrinolo- gists for clinical applicability, identifying 67 correct and 33 incorrect predictions among 100 evaluated cases. We tested 10 different machine learning models, and the random forest model was identified as the best- performing model based on the Jaccard Score.

**Results:**
The DiabetAid system achieved a high Custom Jaccard Score of 84%, reflecting substantial consistency in recommended treatment combinations. Among various predictive models tested, the random forest model demonstrated superior performance based on the Jaccard Score, indicating its efficacy in accurately predicting personalized treat- ments. Expert evaluation provided further insights: among the 100 evaluated predictions, 67 were correct with accurate explanations, 19 were incorrect but clinically applicable with correct explanations, and 14 were incorrect, clinically inapplicable, and had incorrect explana- tions. The model’s clinical applicability accuracy based on expert vali- dation was thus determined to be 86%. Furthermore, the incorporation of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) facilitated healthcare professionals’ understanding of the rationale behind each AI-generated treatment recommendation.

**Conclusion:**
DiabetAid significantly advances personalized diabetes management, utilizing AI to enhance clinical decision-making. The impressive Jaccard Score and validation by expert endocrinologists under- score the system’s capability in providing consistent, clinically relevant recommendations. Future work will focus on model optimization via advanced feature engineering and integrating real-time patient feedback.

**Explainable AI for personalised prediction of adherence to drug therapy in people with type 2 diabetes: a nationwide retrospective cohort**

M. Kasher Meron, R. ­Taher, A. ­Berliner, E. ­Bachmat, D., ­Levinson

**Background and aims:**
Poor adherence to anti-diabetic therapy is a major barrier to effective disease management, leading to poorer outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Reasons for poor adherence may differ, and may relate to characteristics of patient, disease, therapy and health care system. We present a novel approach for predicting medication non-adherence in people with type 2 diabetes that combines domain expertise with advanced machine learning to enhance interpret- ability and explainability.

**Materials and methods:**
We retrospectively analyzed data from Israel’s largest healthcare organization. Included were people with type 2 diabetes, who were prescribed at least one oral anti-diabetic medication and had at least two drug purchases between January 2021 and December 2022. Medication adherence was assessed using the prescription-based Medication Possession Ratio (pMPR), with poor adherence defined as pMPR <0.8. Clinical and administrative features were extracted at baseline. Feature grouping - informed by domain expertise - classified features as reflecting patient general health, healthcare utilization, service accessibility, therapy complexity, and self-care, among others. A light gradient boosting machine model was developed to predict poor adherence, and SHapley Additive exPlana- tions (SHAP) were used to derive feature importance scores within clinically relevant categories. Clustering methods revealed distinct patient profiles based on SHAP-derived adherence patterns.

**Results:**
The study cohort included 207,062 people with type 2 dia- betes. Overall, 49.3% were female, 70.7% were Jewish, with a mean age of 67.2 ± 11.3 years and a mean pMPR of 0.74 ± 0.29. The machine learning model achieved an area under curve receiver opera- tion characteristics (AUROC) of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.85-0.86). Clustering revealed nine distinct clusters, with three clusters (Clusters 0, 1, and 2) showing high rates of poor adherence (90.4%, 90.2%, and 81%, respectively). In Cluster 0, the feature with the most dominant nega- tive SHAP effect on adherence was the presence of diabetes-related complications and uncontrolled glucose levels. In Cluster 1, negative SHAP values were primarily driven by socioeconomic factors and treatment complexity, while in Cluster 2, system-level factors and limited healthcare accessibility had the strongest negative impact on patient adherence.

**Conclusion:**
This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that integrating feature grouping with SHAP-derived clustering can identify distinct adherence profiles. This approach may offer valuable insights into the barriers to medication adherence at both the individual and population levels and may inform personalized interventions to improve adherence in people with diabetes.

1. Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton,
2. AB, Canada, MedicineX, Toronto, ON, Canada, Department of Medi-

**Background and aims:**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for personalised medical treatment. When integrated with real-time electronic medical records (EMR), AI can enhance in- hospital diabetes management by accurately predicting blood glucose (BG). In this study, we evaluate the performance of predictive models trained on EMR data from hospitalised patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) to forecast BG levels at mealtimes and bedtime.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective observational study uti- lised EMR data from 1282 T2D patients admitted for cardiovascu- lar surgery between November 2019 and April 2024, during which 66,876 point-of-care BG measurements were recorded. Key predic- tors included meal types, patient demographics, clinical diagnoses, pre-admission HbA1c levels, procedures, medications, activity and nutrition orders, and laboratory test results. The dataset was charac- terised by mixed, high-dimensional data with unaligned and irregularly sampled measurements - factors that present a significant challenge for long-range BG forecasting. To address this, we propose a model- ling approach that (1) effectively processes irregularly timed data, (2) facilitates generalised BG prediction across patients without requir- ing individualised model customisation, and (3) provides accurate BG forecasts suitable for clinical decision support. We evaluated various predictive models, including statistical methods such as Ridge regres- sion and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), ensemble techniques such as AdaBoost, and deep learning models such as the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). These models were trained to forecast BG levels at three daily mealtimes and bedtime. As a naïve baseline, we included a forward-fill method that propagates the most recent BG value. For evaluation, we used mean absolute error (MAE) as our primary met- ric, along with root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). We also report their glucose-specific vari- ants - gMAE, gRMSE and gMAPE - which incorporate penalties based on the Clarke Error Grid (CEGA). Additionally, Clarke Error (CE) is reported as the percentage of predictions that fall within clinically acceptable zones defined by the CEGA framework.

**Results:**
Comparative experiments demonstrate that our best model, AdaBoost, outperforms the baseline by 31.4% with an average loss of 1.51 mmol/L (27.2 mg/dL). CEGA revealed that 99% of the model’s predictions fall within clinically safe zones A and B.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrate the potential of AI models, par- ticularly AdaBoost, to provide accurate, clinically safe BG predictions for hospitalised T2D patients. This approach can enable more proactive in-hospital diabetes management using routinely collected EMR data.

2. Athens, Greece, Novo Nordisk A/S, Søborg, Denmark, Diabetes

**Background and aims:**
This analysis assessed the association between use of a semaglutide patient support solution (PSS; a phone app ena- bling users to track their doses, weight, and ­HbA [in selected regions; data not reported]) and treatment outcomes in adults with type 2 dia- betes (T2D) receiving semaglutide.

**Materials and methods:**
This real-world, multinational analysis assessed stay time (time spent actively using the PSS), user engage- ment, association between using the PSS reminder features (notifi- cations prompting users to log dose/weight) and engagement, dose escalation over time, and change in weight from baseline (estimated using a linear mixed model with user as a random effect). Start date was defined as first use of the PSS to log dose and/or weight.

**Results:**
At week 1, 52 239 users logged a dose and 33 724 users logged weight data; at 52 weeks, 10 877 and 6 026 users were still actively logging dose and/or weight, respectively. Median stay time was 13 weeks for dose and 12 weeks for weight. Of 41 508 users who logged >1 dose, 33 755 (81.3%) logged dose and/or weight data in >50% of the weeks that they actively used the PSS. Enabling PSS reminder features was associated with a higher probability of logging dose or weight. Of those who started PSS use, 36 495 (69.9%) users began app use while receiving semaglutide at the starting dose of 0.25 mg. After 12 weeks, 92% of these had increased their dose, with 46.9% on 0.5 mg and 45.1% on 1.0 mg. At 52 weeks, 60.9% of users who began PSS use on 0.25 mg semaglutide had reached the maintenance dose of 1.0 mg. In 20 638 users who logged >1 dose and had baseline weight data available (mean baseline weight: 104 kg), the estimated mean (95% CI) change in weight from baseline was −4.94% (−5.08%; −4.80%) after 12 weeks and −9.46% (−9.61%; −9.31%) after 52 weeks. Users with a higher weight at baseline, or who began PSS use while on a 0.25 mg dose, were estimated to lose more weight compared with other users.

**Conclusion:**
The PSS can be used by people with T2D to effectively track treatment outcomes and semaglutide dose titration.

6. India, DoctorAssist.Ai, Bangalore, India.

**Background and aims:**
Despite intensive insulin therapy and techno- logical advancements, optimal glycemic control remains elusive for many patients with diabetes. We hypothesized that individual patients exhibit consistent time-dependent patterns of glycemic vulnerability that could inform precision diabetes management. This study aimed to identify and characterize these temporal glycemic fingerprints and evaluate their clinical utility.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted prospective analysis of CGM data from 134 patients with diabetes (83 T2D, 51 T1D) over 14 consecu- tive days. Each patient’s 24-hour cycle was divided into 8 time blocks with comprehensive glycemic metrics calculated for each block. Using unsupervised machine learning algorithms, we identified distinct tem- poral vulnerability patterns. Patients underwent standardized meal and activity protocols on days 1-7, followed by personalized time-based interventions on days 8-14 targeting their specific vulnerability patterns.

**Results:**
Cluster analysis revealed four distinct temporal vulnerability patterns we termed "chronotypes": (1) Dawn Hyperglycemia (22% of patients) with >20% glucose rise between 04:00-08:00; (2) Noctur- nal Hypoglycemia (31%) with nadir glucose between 02:00-04:00; (3) Postprandial Volatility (34%) with peak-to-trough excursions >80 mg/dL following meals; and (4) Evening Hyperglycemia (13%) with sustained elevations between 20:00-22:00. Chronotype-guided inter- ventions during days 8-14 resulted in significant improvements com- pared to standard therapy: Time in Range increased by 2.8 hours/day (p<0.001), hypoglycemic events decreased by 62% (p<0.001), and gly- cemic variability (CV%) reduced from 36% to 29% (p<0.01). Notably, 87% of patients maintained consistent chronotype patterns regardless of diet or activity variations.

**Conclusion:**
This study introduces the novel concept of glycemic chrono- types—consistent temporal vulnerability patterns that can guide precision diabetes management. The significant improvements achieved through chronotype-guided interventions demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach. Time-based risk stratification represents a paradigm shift from reactive to preventative diabetes management, enabling targeted interven- tions at periods of highest vulnerability for individual patients.

**Background and aims:**
There is a lack of high-quality RCT evidence demonstrating the utility of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) treated with basal-only insulin regimens. Data are limited when basal insulin therapy is combined with sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), which are increasingly pre- scribed. The FreeDM2 study aims to evaluate the impact of the FreeStyle Libre 3 (FSL3) rtCGM system in T2DM treated with basal-only insulin regimens plus SGLT-2i and/or GLP-1RA and understand the factors responsible for modulating glycaemia.

**Materials and methods:**
FreeDM2 is an open label, multicentre, parallel design RCT conducted in the UK. Adults with T2DM prescribed basal- only insulin plus SGLT-2i and/or GLP-1RA or dual GIP/GLP-1RA, with screening HbA1c levels between 59 and 97 mmol/mol (7.5-11.0%), were included. Participants were randomised to FSL3 (intervention) for 32 weeks or continuation of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). The study is split into two 16-week phases: phase 1 (self-management including basal-insulin self-titration) and phase 2 (where additional therapies may be initiated by clinicians). The primary endpoint is the difference between treatment groups in mean change from baseline in HbA1c at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes include CGM-based metrics, therapy changes, accel- erometer physical activity and patient-reported outcome measures.

**Results:**
A total of 303 participants were randomised (2:1), with 198 assigned to the intervention arm and 105 to the SMBG arm. Key baseline data are summarised in Table 1. Results pertaining to the primary end- point at 16 weeks will be available during the presentation.

**Conclusion:**
The FreeDM2 study will add to a growing body of evidence assessing the impact of CGM on glycaemia in T2DM whilst understand- ing the factors responsible for changes in glycaemic outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
There is limited real-world evidence evaluat- ing the impact of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rt-CGM) devices on the clinical outcomes and healthcare resource use (HRU) for insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients. Assessing the impact of rt- CGM device use on acute diabetes events and HRU for these patients can provide valuable reference for clinical practice. The objective of this study was to assess changes acute diabetes events and HRU one- year prior to rt-CGM initiation and one-year post-rt-CGM initiation.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective observational study ana- lysed SNDS data from 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2022. The SNDS is a national healthcare claims database covering 99% of the population in France, including pseudonymized patient-level claims data with diagnosis, procedure, and reimbursement information from nationwide insurers. Analyses among 1,456 rt-CGM users with Type 2 diabetes taking insulin compared clinical outcomes, healthcare resource utilisation, and costs between two time periods: one year before rt-CGM initiation versus one year after rt-CGM initiation.

**Results:**
The occurrence of acute diabetes events were reduced one year after rt-CGM initiation compared to the year preceding rt-CGM initiation (incidence rate ratio (IRR) (95% confidence internal (CI)): 0.677 (0.486; 0.937), P value = 0.0146), leading to reduced use of inpatient resources (IRR (95%CI) = 0.937 (0.890; 0.986), P value = 0.0119) driven by reduced overnight hospitalisation stays (IRR (95%CI) = 0.827 (0.760; 0.900), P value < 0.0001).

**Conclusion:**
This retrospective study indicates that rt-CGM use was associated with reduced occurrence of acute diabetes events and reduced inpatient resource utilisation among insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients. These findings imply that as observed for people with type 1 diabetes, rt-CGM may contribute to improving patient out- comes, reducing HRU, in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
The UK, Ireland and Austria certify commer- cial pilots with insulin-treated diabetes to fly under the ARA.MED.330 diabetes protocol that requires safety-validated finger-stick blood glu- cose monitoring (SMBG) while on duty and frequent clinical review. The use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) compared to SMBG in pilots operating within the pressurised cabin environment within the diabetes protocol is evaluated.

**Materials and methods:**
This prospective, multicentred, observational study enrolled pilots aged 18-75 years, on insulin therapy, with an HbA1c <75.0 mmol/mol (<9.0%), who hold an EU Class 1 medical certificate and are currently participating in the ARA.MED.330 dia- betes protocol. CGM values recorded using the Dexcom ­G6 during pre- and in-flight periods were compared to simultaneously recorded SMBG values over a 12-month follow-up period.

**Results:**
Seventeen male, class 1 pilots, with either type 1 (94%) or type 3c diabetes (6%) participated. Median age of participants was 42.0 years (IQR 36.0-49.0), median diabetes duration was 7.7 years (IQR 5.2-12.7) and mean HbA1c at enrolment was 50.2 ±9.7 mmol/mol (6.7 ±0.9%). A total of 11,918 paired SMBG and CGM values were analysed. The mean glucose concentration was 8.3 ±2.0 mmol/L (149 mg/dL) measured using SMBG and 8.4 ±2.0 mmol/L (151 mg/dL) using CGM. The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between methods was 9.61 (SEM ±3.3) and coefficient of variation 0.86. There were 186 (1.6%) SMBG values and 221 (1.9%) CGM values recorded <5.0 mmol/L (<90 mg/dL) or >15.0 mmol/L (>270 mg/dL). On only 86 occasions did both SMBG and CGM simultaneously record a value <5.0 mmol/L or >15.0 mmol/L. However, CGM correlated very closely with SMBG over time, even at the extremes of glucose concentration (figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
CGM can provide a safe, accurate and reliable alterna- tive to finger-stick SMBG for commercial pilots with insulin-treated diabetes while flying, even at the extremes of glucose concentration. CGM systems may offer additional safety benefits due to data trend lines, predictive glucose change arrows and alarms which can reduce values <5.0 and >15.0 mmol/L.

4. NingBo University, NingBo, China, The HuNan Provincial Children’s

**Background and aims:**
The iCan CGM system features ­3 generation sensor technology based on GDH-FAD. After receiving CE approval for a 15-day wear time in adults, the next step was to conduct a study in a pediatric population (ages 2-17) to support its approval for use in children and adolescents with diabetes. This abstract presents user feedback and alert performance in this population.

**Materials and methods:**
This prospective, multicenter, single-arm study included 76 participants aged 2-17 years, with 16 subjects in the 2-5 year age group. The majority (86.8%) had type 1 diabetes. The study duration was 16 days. Device performance was assessed on days 1-2, 7-9, and 15-16 by comparison with a laboratory reference device. On day 16, participants completed a feedback questionnaire. Data were analyzed using generally accepted statistical methods.

**Results:**
Regarding sensor insertion, 86.7% of the subjects reported no pain, 13.3% reported moderate pain, and none reported severe pain. The insertion process was considered convenient by 97.3% of par- ticipants, while 2.7% found it generally acceptable, and none found it inconvenient. Similarly, 97.3% rated the assembly of the inserter as very convenient, 2.7% as generally acceptable, and none as inconven- ient. When evaluating the overall comfort of use during the 16-day period, 93.3% of the participants reported the device as comfortable, 6.7% as average, and none as unacceptable.The system’s ability to detect hypo and hyperglycemic events was assessed as a key safety feature. The true detection rate for hypoglycemia was 99.2%, while for hyperglycemia, the true detection rate was 97.5%. These findings align with the analytical performance data, which showed an overall MARD of 8.30% and a 20/20% performance of 96.40%. The MARD across the 15-day wear period was estimated at 8.46% for days 1-2, 7.52% for days 7-9, and 8.98% for days 15-16. The Consensus Error Grid analysis indicated that 100.0% (95% CI: 99.8%-100.0%) of paired readings fell within Zones A+B. No device-related or skin-related adverse events were reported.

**Conclusion:**
This regulatory study of the iCan CGM System in a pedi- atric population (ages 2-17) demonstrates a high level of user satisfac- tion, with most subjects reporting no pain during sensor insertion, an easy insertion process, and high comfort over the 15-day wear time. The system also showed strong safety performance, with a true detec- tion rate of over 95% for hypo and hyperglycemia. The overall accuracy remained high, with a MARD of 8.30% and single-digit MARD values below 9.0% at each accuracy assessment, consistently surpassing the 95% threshold for 20/20% performance. These results are consistent with the system’s previously reported performance in adults.

**Background and aims:**
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)- derived glucose management indicator (GMI) intends to reflect HbA1c, but it can be skewed at clinically relevant low and high HbA1c. On the other hand, HbA1c can fail to accurately reflect average glucose due to personal variations in red blood cell physiology, which has implica- tions for diabetes populations in whom HbA1c is the main glycemic assessment tool. To help optimize glycemic management in diabetes, our aim was to improve GMI consistency and address variations in HbA1c accuracy.

**Materials and methods:**
A 26-week study of adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D, respectively) collected CGM data throughout and HbA1c every 2 weeks. The first 12 weeks of the study were used for training and weeks 20-26 for testing. To correct for red blood cell factors, we used a population mean of personal gly- cation ratio (PGR) at 65ml/g to enable HbA1c adjustments by cal- culating personalized A1c (pA1C) through the formula: = 100/ [1+ (1.536/ - 0.01536)]GMI was determined using an established formula (GMI=3.31 + 0.02392 [mean glucose in mg/dL] ), while the updated GMI (uGMI) employed the formula: (%) = [(15.36/mean glucose(mg/dL) + 0.0425)] Deming regression was used to evaluate HbA1c-GMI, HbA1c-uGMI, and pA1C-uGMI relationships at weeks 20-26 for all study participants and separately for those with type 2 diabetes.

**Results:**
Of 257 participants with complete CGM and HbA1c datasets, mean age (±SD) was 53+14 years (45% females), with 19% having T1D and 81% T2D. The racial background comprised 35% Asian, 30% White, 22% Black and 14% other/mixed. HbA1c-GMI regression slope was 25% above unity, which improved with uGMI to within 3% of unity. However, GMI-HbA1c and uGMI-HbA1c correlations demon- strating modest agreement (R2=0.81 both) and large spread as shown by wide prediction intervals in Figure 1. Use of pA1c reduced data spread with pA1C-uGMI showing improved correlations ­(R =0.93) while maintaining near unity slope. These findings were consistent in those with T2D, who would particularly benefit from using pA1c rather than HbA1c, as uninterrupted CGM is not routinely used in this population.

**Conclusion:**
The updated GMI improves the alignment with HbA1c and alleviates concerns in relation to over- and under-estimating HbA1c in cohort level, while personalized A1C improves the correlation with this CGM-derived metric by adjusting for variability in red blood cell physiology.

2. jing Medical University, Suzhou, China, Department of Endocrinol-

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is frequently characterized by subtle symptoms, thereby complicating the early detection and progress prediction of this disease. Regenerating protein Iα (REG Iα), a secretory protein predominantly produced by pancreatic cells, demonstrates elevated serum concentrations in T2DM patients with renal impairment, showing significant correlation with renal func- tion.This prospective study aimed to investigate the clinical value of serum REG Iα protein in predicting DKD progression, providing new insights and methods for early intervention and disease progression assessment.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 855 patients with DKD enrolled from August 2022 to December 2024 were followed up. The assess- ments included glycemic and lipid, renal function markers, acute/ chronic diabetic complications, and other conditions (such as infec- tions, malignancies and mental status). The endpoint was a >30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which defined as progression of DKD. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was used to examine the relationship between serum levels of REG Iα and the endpoint. Cox regression analyzed risk factors for disease progres- sion. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis evaluated the predictive ability of high REG Iα levels. A support vector machine (SVM) regres- sion model incorporating serum REG Iα and clinical risk factors was developed, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessed model performance.

**Results:**
There were 172 (20.12%) DKD patients experienced renal function decline, with a 65.03% rate of multiple hospitalizations and a median follow-up of 14 [8-20] months. RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between baseline serum REG Iα levels and the endpoint (Nonlinear = 0.037), with a cutoff value of 93.52 ng/mL. Below this threshold, the risk of disease progression increased rapidly with rising REG Iα levels ( < 0.001). When over this threshold, the progression risk increased slower. Multivariate Cox regression identi- fied baseline serum REG Iα as an independent predictor of renal func- tion decline (HR = 1.777 [1.051-3.004], = 0.032), after adjusting confunding factors. K-M survival analysis demonstrated significantly increased risk in patients with elevated baseline REG Iα levels (>93.52 ng/mL) compared to those with lower levels (≤93.52 ng/mL) (Log- rank ² = 13.30, < 0.001). The SVM model incorporating serum REG Iα combined with clinical parameters (age, sex, hypertension history, FBG, Scr, and BUN) demonstrated better predictive perfor- mance compared to individual biomarkers alone (such as Scr andv BUN), as evidenced by significantly higher AUC values in both train- ing groups(0.874 vs 0.615 vs 0.561, < 0.001) and validation groups (0.919 vs 0.727 vs 0.603, < 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
The study demonstrate a significant association between serum REG Iα and renal function decline in patients with DKD. Ele- vated baseline serum REG Iα levels independently predict DKD pro- gression. The combined prediction model incorporating serum REG Iα and clinical risk factors demonstrates good performance in forecast- ing DKD progression, suggesting its potential as an auxiliary tool for disease assessment.

**Background and aims:**
Individuals with 1 diabetes and a rapid eGFR decline are at high risk of kidney failure. Identifying these individuals at risk is crucial for preventing or delaying kidney function loss. Impor- tantly, geographical location and ethnicity influence the risk profile e.g., African Caribbean ethnicity was previously associated with rapid eGFR decline. In this study, we compare the clinical profile of adults with type 1 diabetes from a Finnish, ethnically homogeneous cohort to an ethnically diverse cohort from London, UK.

**Materials and methods:**
We included 3,068 adults from the FinnDiane study (mean age 37.3 ± 11.7 years, 49.7% female) and 2,878 adults from southeast London (mean age 35.1 ± 12.0, 51.5% female; 2,507 had Caucasian and 371 African-Caribbean heritage). Inclusion criteria were baseline eGFR ≥45 ml/min/1.73 ­m , ≥3 eGFR measurements, and minimum of 2-year follow-up. Rapid eGFR decline was defined as eGFR decline ≥ 3ml/min/1.73 ­m /year. Multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis with standardized covariates was performed.

**Results:**
Of the FinnDiane cohort, 13.7% experienced rapid eGFR decline during a median of 12.6 (7.6-17.2) years, while the percentages in London were 11.6% in the Caucasians and 20.8% in the African- Caribbeans (median follow-up 9.0 [5.3-12.0] years). In the FinnDiane cohort, the most influential predictors were severe (OR 8.29 [95% CI 5.90,11.66], <0.0001) and moderate (2.65 [1.95, 3.62], <0.0001) albuminuria and ­HbA (1.79 [1.75, 2.01], P <0.0001). Similarly, in the Caucasian London cohort, severe (3.56 [2.16, 6.18], <0.0001) and moderate (2.17 [1.33, 3.76], =0.003) albuminuria, followed by higher eGFR (2.03 [1.75, 2.36], <0.0001), and systolic BP (1.59 [1.39, 1.81], <0.0001) had the strongest impact. In African Caribbean peo- ple higher eGFR (2.04 [1.47, 2.88], <0.0001) and diastolic BP (1.72 [1.29, 2.33], =0.0003) were associated with rapid eGFR decline. In this group, albuminuria was a significant predictor, but only as a con- tinuous variable (1.57 [1.18, 2.13], =0.003), probably reflecting the lower numbers of people with normal AER. In addition, ­HbA was a significant predictor in both London cohorts, but with slightly lower effect sizes than in the FinnDiane cohort.

**Conclusion:**
Although the effect sizes varied, the key factors for rapid eGFR decline remained largely similar across cohorts. In the African Caribbean cohort, diastolic BP emerged as a strong predictor. Nota- bly, in both London cohorts, higher baseline eGFR associated strongly with rapid eGFR decline, which might reflect a hyperfiltration phase, potentially leading to faster decline. More studies are needed to better understand the role of ethnicity in the complex interplay of risk factors for kidney function decline in people with type 1 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
With increasing rates of diabetes in youth, understanding modifiable factors predicting kidney (DKD) and car- diovascular disease in early life is key as well as how these evolve over time. In type 1 diabetes, early risk factors are less well characterised in younger cohorts potentially limiting the utility of novel renoprotec- tive agents.

**Materials and methods:**
All youth with type 1 diabetes presenting at a single centre (N=548, M 49% : F 51%, aged 12-27yrs, median diabetes duration 5.5(3.5)) with >2 eGFR measurements at least ~5.8(2.7) yrs apart ­(CKiD and CKD-EPI ) were retrospectively assessed between 2011-2020.

**Results:**
During follow up, 14.4% were diagnosed with DKD (2.5% ESKD, ISPAD criteria) and had significantly greater rates of acute diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (p<0.001), DKA with acute kidney injury (AKI) (6.2 vs 17.7%; p<0.001) and chronic complications (retinopathy, 10.4 vs 22.8% and peripheral neuropathy 2.1 vs 8.9%; both p<0.006) in the DKD group despite the use of RASi and/or SGLT2i/GLP-RA therapy in ~33%. Baseline eGFR, median of repeated ­HbA , lipids, logUACR, SBP and DBP were each higher in subjects with DKD. For longitudinal assessment of the same subject, using the mean of CKiD and CKD-EPI showed slower eGFR decline initially followed by a more rapid decrease from ~25 years of age in those diagnosed with DKD at any stage (Figure 1). In a whole of cohort analysis, eGFR decreased ~ -2.11 ml/min/1.73m annually (-2.11, 95% CI -2.78 to -1.44). Baseline eGFR was an independent predictor of rate of eGFR loss with a decline of 0.17 units/yr observed for each unit increase in baseline eGFR (-0.17, 95% CI -0.20 - -0.13, p<0.001) in multivariable linear regression analysis with adjustment for sex (male), logUACR, SBP, DKD diagnosis and years between visits. These models also showed that the rate of eGFR loss was greater in males (-1.41 units/ year, 95% CI: -2.63 - - 0.18, p=0.025) but less for individuals with higher mean ­HbA (0.78, 95% CI: 0.35 - 1.21, p<0.001) and loguACR (0.89, 95% CI: 0.25 - 1.52, p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Youth with T1DM in this Australian cohort showed sig- nificant acute and chronic complication rates including DKD. This highlights that despite advances in diabetes care, residual risk of DKD remains high in this population where targeted research and therapeutic options are more limited. Longitudinal follow-up and active surveil- lance remains key to the early detection and management of this vul- nerable group.

1. Folkhälsan Research Center, Helsinki, Finland, Department of
3. tal, Helsinki, Finland, Research Program for Clinical and Molecular
4. Finland, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia.

**Background and aims:**
Adults with type 1 diabetes have a high burden of kidney disease. Traditional biomarkers such as albuminu- ria and eGFR may not detect individuals at risk at early stages. This study investigates how proteomic panels might improve the detection, and compares them to panels built from known risk factors and their combination.

**Materials and methods:**
This FinnDiane Study measured 5,420 serum proteins and 12 clinical factors including eGFR at baseline, and fol- lowed up 3 subsets of adults with type 1 diabetes for a mean 9.5 years (± 5.3 years): 449 with normal AER of whom 37% experienced onset of albuminuria, 149 adults with moderate albuminuria of whom 40% progressed to severe albuminuria, and 232 adults with severe albuminu- ria of whom 45% progressed to kidney failure (KF). Outcome measure was the C-index derived from Cox regression models. Minimal panels from proteomics data only, clinical data only, and their combination were derived by feature selection through Lasso regression, and were built by randomly splitting participants into a training (70%) and test (30%) cohort. Parameters were optimized during training by cross- validation and bootstrapping. The models were externally validated on 32 adults with moderate albuminuria (13% progressors) and 75 adults with severe albuminuria (16% progressing to KF).

**Results:**
The strongest clinical predictors were HbA1c for onset and progression of albuminuria, and eGFR for progression to KF (Table 1). For albuminuria onset, KIM-1 was the only protein that remained in the model and increased the C-index in the test set when added to HbA1c. For progression to severe albuminuria, a model comprising 5 proteins achieved a better performance than the clinical only model in the test and validation set. A panel of 12 proteins detecting the progression to KF outperformed eGFR in the test set, but eGFR alone had the highest C-index in the validation test.

**Conclusion:**
We show that proteomics panels might help in detecting adults with type 1 diabetes at risk of kidney disease especially at the early disease stages either combined with routine clinical data as for the onset or tentatively by themselves for the progression to severe albuminuria. Further validation in bigger cohorts is however needed.

**Background and aims:**
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) significantly impairs health outcomes, quality of life, and increases healthcare costs and mortality risk among individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study employed an emulated target trial design to evaluate and compare the risk of incident renal outcomes between patients with T2D without pre-existing CKD who were newly initiated on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibi- tors (DPP-4is).

**Materials and methods:**
Using data from the TriNetX Collaborative Network, this study identified 370,636 patients with T2D between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2023. An emulated target trial was con- structed, comprising 24,510 propensity score-matched pairs of new users of GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4is. Composite CKD events (defined as a combination of CKD diagnosis, eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m², dialysis, and kidney transplantation), acute kidney injury (AKI), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and all-cause mortality were compared between groups using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models.

**Results:**
In this emulated target trial, the mean age of participants was 57.6 years (SD 12.0), and 48.9% were male. Compared to DPP- 4i users, those initiated on GLP-1 RAs exhibited significantly lower risks of composite chronic kidney events (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.82-0.87), incident CKD (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²; HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.82- 0.88), dialysis (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.43-0.64), AKI (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.76-0.86), MACE (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.81-0.88), and all-cause mortal- ity (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.50-0.59). Kaplan-Meier analyses confirmed a significantly lower cumulative incidence of these outcomes in GLP-1 RA users (log-rank p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Subgroup analyses consistently demonstrated reduced risks of kidney-related outcomes with GLP-1 RA use across all examined subpopulations.

**Conclusion:**
This multicenter emulated target trial showed that, among patients with T2D without pre-existing CKD, the use of GLP-1 RAs was associated with a lower risk of composite renal events, incident CKD, dialysis, AKI, major cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortal- ity compared to DPP-4is.

**Background and aims:**
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents a global challenge and significant financial burden, with an increased risk of getting other chronic vascular complications, especially among indi- viduals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Early indicators of CKD, accord- ing to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, rely on kidney function markers, including a) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and b) albuminuria (ALB). While multiple genetic loci associated with these two traits are known, the relationship between common loci re-mains incompletely understood. Mapping the interrelationship between ALB and eGFR using genetic data could reveal target mechanisms, ultimately aiding in the develop- ment of more effective CKD risk monitoring and treatment strategies. The current study aims to map the genetic basis of ALB-eGFR relation- ship in individuals with and without T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
465,446 individuals (94% Europeans) with information on genetic and phenotypic data from the UK Biobank (UKB) were included. 59 known albuminuria loci were tested. Pheno- typic data included urine albumin concentration (mg/L; ALB) as the primary outcome, serum creatinine, sex, age, and systolic blood pres- sure (SBP). 19,380 individuals had T2D. eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI creatinine 2021 race free equation. Data preprocessing involved outlier correction, removal of missing values and normaliza- tion. ALB and eGFR were log transformed. Multiple linear regression adjusting for age, sex and SBP was employed to a. validate known ALB loci, and b. to investigate the relationship between ALB loci and eGFR measures using the entire UKB population and T2D subgroup, considering significance at ≤ 0.05 before and after multiple testing correction.

**Results:**
Among 59 known ALB SNPs tested, 40 associated with ALB ( ≤ 0.05, n=137,287). 29 of 40 also associated with eGFR before ( ≤ 0.05, n=432,292), and 24 after Bonferroni correction in the overall study population. The top findings included locus (rs67339103 A-allele) associated with higher ALB (Beta = 0.022, = 7.2 × ­10 ) and lower eGFR (Beta = -0.001, = 6.0 × ­10 ) and locus (rs10023335 C-allele) associated with lower ALB (Beta = -0.02, = 5.9 × ­10 ) and lower eGFR (Beta = -0.003, = 1.0 × ­10 ). In the T2D population (n=19,380), 16 loci associated with ALB ( ≤ 0.05). 4 of 16 loci associated with eGFR before and 3 after Bonferroni correc- tion especially the locus (rs10491967 A-allele) (ALB, Beta = 0.029, = 0.003; eGFR, Beta= -0.006, = 4.3 × ­10 ).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings elucidate the complex interplay between ALB and eGFR common loci, revealing diverse relationships character- ized by varying effects. These findings highlight the multifaceted and pleiotropic nature of genetic loci in shaping the ALB-eGFR relation- ship in both the general population and individuals with T2D. Differ- ences in this relationship may have significant implications for risk monitoring and warrant further investigation, particularly in relation to diabetes and metabolic status.

**Role of body mass index variability an index of ‘cardio-metabolic cycling’ on progression of kidney disease in people with type 1 diabetes**

M. Ozdede

**Background and aims:**
There is emerging data on the effect of body mass index (BMI) variability as a predictor of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. The effect of BMI variability on kidney disease progression in people with type 1 diabetes is unclear and has not been studied in contemporary ethnically diverse cohorts. Our aim was to explore if BMI variability was associated with kidney disease progres- sion in an urban cohort of people with type 1 diabetes and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥45 ml/min/1.73m².

**Materials and methods:**
We evaluated 3,437 people with type 1 diabe- tes (50% female, mean age of 36.4 years) attending routine out-patient care at two large university hospitals in London with baseline eGFR ≥45 ml/min/1.73m² between 2004 and 2018. Clinical and biochemical data was collected from hospital outpatient electronic health records. eGFR was estimated using CKD Epi equation.BMI variability was assessed using three distinct methods: visit-adjusted standard deviation (VadjSD), variability independent of the mean (VIM), and average real variability (ARV).Main outcome measurement was a kidney endpoint defined as an eGFR decline of >50% from baseline to a final eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m². Multivariate Fine and Gray models, accounting for death as a competing event, were also utilised.

**Results:**
Baseline mean (±standard deviation) BMI was 25.0 ± 4.8 kg/ m² and of the cohort 200 people (5.8%) reached the kidney endpoint. All three BMI variability indices were independently associated with kidney disease endpoint. VadjSD hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confi- dence intervals (95% CI) of 2.48 (95% CI [1.97-3.12]), VIM HR 1.96 (95% CI [1.64-2.35]), and ARV HR 4.06 (95% CI [2.03-9.09]) after adjusting for traditional risk factors and baseline BMI. BMI variabil- ity remained significantly associated with kidney disease endpoint in competing risk analyses where death was competing event.

**Conclusion:**
BMI variability is an independent risk factor for kidney disease progression in people with type 1 diabetes. Our results suggest that BMI variability which is an index/marker of ‘cardio-metabolic cycling’ influences kidney disease progression. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of this association in people with type 1 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Subcutaneous semaglutide has shown reno- protective effects in people with type 2 diabetes (PWT2D), but data on oral semaglutide remain limited. This multicenter real-world study evaluates the clinical effectiveness of oSEMA on renal outcomes in PLWT2D.

**Materials and methods:**
We included PW2TD aged ≥18 years who initiated oral semaglutide in routine practice between November 2021 and November 2022 in the Spanish National Health System, with at least one report of clinical follow-up (FU) data at 3 months. Co-pri- mary endpoints were changes in urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope at 6-12 months. We also assessed baseline predictors of response, drug persis- tence, and safety by CKD severity.

**Results:**
Baseline and FU renal data were available for 819 PWT2D (median age 63 years, eGFR 88.1 mL/min/1.73m2, UACR 12 mg/g, 45.8% female). Treatment with oral semaglutide reduced AUCR by 30.3% and 40.0% in the overall cohort, by 40.2% and 50.7% in those with a UACR ≥ 30 mg/g, and by 40.6% and 49.9% in those with a UACR ≥ 300 mg/g at 6 and 12-months FU, respectively. PWT2D with a low age-adjusted risk of liver fibrosis by the FIB-4 index had increased odds of achieving a >30% reduction in UACR (aOR 5.50 [95% CI 1.6-18.7]) regardless of baseline background. Metabolic and weight loss effectiveness, safety and persistence of oral semaglutide were consistent across CKD severities.

**Conclusion:**
In a real-world setting, oral semaglutide treatment resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in albuminuria without changes in eGFR slope in PWT2D. Effectiveness, safety and toler- ability were not influenced by CKD severity.

**Prediction of renal disease using cystatin C as a serum biomarker versus serum creatinine in hospitalised diabetic patients**

J. Rodríguez Despradel, Rosario

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of renal disease, often leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Early detection is crucial to prevent progression. Cystatin C has been proposed as a more sensitive biomarker than serum creatinine. This study aimed to compare their predictive value in hospitalized diabetic patients.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective, observational, descriptive study was conducted on hospitalized diabetic patients at the National Institute of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Nutrition (August 2022 - Feb- ruary 2023). Clinical records of 277 patients were analyzed. Patients undergoing renal replacement therapy, kidney transplantation, corticos- teroid treatment, or with thyroid disorders, malignancies, liver failure, or pregnancy were excluded. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using cystatin C and creatinine-based equa- tions. Linear regression models assessed their predictive value using correlation (R) and determination coefficients (R²), with significance set at p<0.05.

**Results:**
Cystatin C showed stronger predictive value for renal impair- ment (R=0.89, R²=0.788) than creatinine (R=0.85, R²=0.72). It was more sensitive in detecting early CKD, classifying more patients in stage 2 (26.71%) and 3A (8.66%). Significant associations were found with alcohol/tobacco use (R=-19.91, p=0.004) and HbA1c (R=- 0.0477, p=0.018).

**Conclusion:**
Cystatin C demonstrated superior predictive accuracy and sensitivity for early CKD detection. It should be considered for routine renal assessment in hospitalized patients and integrated into clinical guidelines.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease and is a major cause of mor- tality in patients with diabetes. Recently, hypoxia has been identified as an important pathogenic factor for DKD. Hypoxia is present in the kidney of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients and in animal models of diabetes, predominantly in the medullary region. Hypoxia in renal tubules is the driving force for tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, which can further reinforce glomerular pathology during the develop- ment of diabetic nephropathy. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is the major regulator of adaptive responses to hypoxia. However, both protein stabilisation and function of HIF-1 are inhibited in diabetic kid- ney, which contributes to the progression of DKD. The destabilization of HIF-1 in diabetes is mainly through the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) - mediated degradation of HIF-1α. However, the role of tubular VHL in DKD is still not clear. This study aims to investigate the impact of tubule-specific VHL ablation on HIF-1α stabilization and DKD pro- gression, providing insights into potential therapeutic target for DKD.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate the role of tubular VHL in DKD, we generated renal tubule - specific VHL knockout (tubular-VHL-KO) mice by breeding B6.129S4(C)-VHL /J mice possessing sites flanking exon 1 of the VHL gene with Ksp-Cre transgenic mice express- ing Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse Cadherin 16 pro- moter. Diabetes was induced in male tubular-VHL-KO and WT mice with streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Kidney pathology and renal function were analyzed 6 weeks after the induction of diabetes.

**Results:**
Tubule-specific VHL gene ablation reduced VHL gene expres- sion to 73.88±1.96% in healthy mouse kidneys and 70.74±8.52% in STZ-induced diabetic kidneys. This led to HIF-1α stabilization in distal tubules and collecting ducts, followed by upregulation of HIF-1 target genes in diabetic kidneys, such as (78.6±4.7 in WT-STZ vs. 106.8±6.9 in KO-STZ) and (88.9±6.4 in WT-STZ vs. 119.7±5.5 in KO-STZ) (n=6, <0.01). In diabetic tubular-VHL-KO mice, ROS levels were reduced shown by 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein adduct levels per mg protein decreased from 3.7±0.2 in WT-STZ to 2.1±0.2 in KO-STZ ( <0.01). This was accompanied by reduced tubular injury demonstrated by decreased expression of Kidney Injury Marker-1 (KIM-1, 1.0±0.26 vs 0.16±0.05, <0.01), a biomarker for renal proxi- mal tubule injury, and less TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (40.3±3.6% vs 5.3±1.4%, <0.001). Additionally, albuminuria was significantly ameliorated in diabetic tubular-VHL-KO mice demonstrated by reduced urine Albumin / Creatinine ratio from 67.4±6.8 μg/mg in WT-STZ mice to 25.4±5.9 μg/mg in KO-STZ mice ( <0.01), suggesting that tubule- specific VHL gene ablation can protect against DKD development.

**Conclusion:**
Tubule-specific VHL gene ablation stabilizes HIF-1α and protects against renal injury in diabetic mice, suggesting that tubular VHL can be a potential therapeutic target for DKD.

**Study on the mechanism of ELA regulating metabolic repro- gramming in renal tubular epithelial cells via C/EBPβ-mediated MRPL12 to improve diabetic kidney fibrosis**

Z. Wang

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic kidney disease is the main cause of chronic kidney disease, renal tubular EMT and fibrosis play an impor- tant role in the occurrence and development of diabetic nephropathy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ELA on EMT in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice and HG-induced human proximal renal tubular epithelial cell lines and explore the related mechanisms.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL/6J mice (6-8 weeks) under- went right nephrectomy followed by left kidney cortical injection of Elabela-overexpressing lentivirus or control lentivirus. One week post-transduction, diabetic nephropathy was induced by intraperitoneal streptozotocin (STZ) injection. After 12 weeks of diabetes induction, we assessed metabolic parameters (blood glucose, body weight), renal function indicators (serum creatinine, 24-hour urinary albumin/protein excretion), and renal histopathology. EMT-related markers were evalu- ated by western blot and qRT-PCR. In vitro, HK2 cells exposed to high glucose (HG, 30 mM) with/without Elabela peptide treatment were analyzed for EMT markers through multiple approaches (western blot, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence). Transcriptomic sequencing and bio- informatics analysis (ALLGGEN-PROMO,JASPAR) were performed on HG-treated HK2 cells with/without Elabela intervention. Mitochon- drial function was comprehensively evaluated using JC-1 staining, Sea- horse mitochondrial stress tests, MitoTracker staining, and transmission electron microscopy. MRPL12 knockdown experiments combined with C/EBPβ transcriptional regulation analysis were conducted to elucidate molecular mechanisms.

**Results:**
STZ-induced diabetic mice exhibited characteristic meta- bolic disturbances (reduced body weight, elevated blood glucose) unaffected by Elabela overexpression. Diabetic nephropathy mani- festations - increased serum creatinine (1.8-fold) and 24 hour uri- nary albumin (7-fold) - were significantly attenuated by Elabela intervention(p<0.05). Histopathological analysis revealed that Elabela overexpression mitigated diabetes-associated tubulointerstitial fibrosis (about 45% reduction vs diabetic controls). Molecular analysis dem- onstrated Elabela-mediated downregulation of mesenchymal markers (α-SMA, vimentin) and restoration of epithelial markers (E-cadherin) in both renal tissues and HG-stimulated HK2 cells. Transcriptomic profiling identified 390 differentially expressed genes (|log2FC|>1, p<0.05) primarily enriched in mitochondrial pathways. Functional studies revealed that Elabela enhanced oxidative phosphorylation capacity (basal OCR elevated 42%), and prevented ultrastructural dam- age (mitochondrial cristae integrity maintained) under HG conditions. Mechanistically, Elabela reversed HG-induced suppression of C/EBPβ expression (2.1-fold increase), subsequently upregulating MRPL12 transcription (1.8-fold) and mitochondrial-encoded gene expression (ND1, COX1 increased 1.5-2.0-fold). MRPL12 knockdown abolished Elabela-mediated mitochondrial protection and EMT inhibition.

**Conclusion:**
Elabela exerts protective effects in diabetic nephropathy through APJ receptor-mediated activation of the C/EBPβ-MRPL12 axis, which enhances mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capac- ity, mitigates metabolic stress, and consequently suppresses renal tubu- lar EMT and fibrotic progression.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of kidney failure worldwide and is characterized by chronic inflamma- tion and oxidative stress. The NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component of the innate immune response, plays a central role in this process. DJ-1, a protein with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and its derived peptide ND-13 have shown potential in attenuating renal injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in peripheral immune cells in DN and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ND-13 in the prevention of diabe- tes-related kidney injury.

**Materials and methods:**
The study used mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and two diabetic animal models:. STZ-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice treated with ND-13 or the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950. Peritoneal macrophages and kidney tissues were analyzed for inflam- masome activity, gene expression and histopathological changes. On the other hand, the db/db obese and diabetic mouse model, character- ised by a genetic mutation of the leptin receptor, was also used. These mice were treated with ND-13 and PAS staining was analysed in the renal cortex of these mice. Additionally, Human PBMCs from diabetic patients with and without nephropathy were analyzed for IL-1β release. Techniques included qPCR, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and histo- logical assessment of renal injury and fibrosis.

**Results:**
IL-1β concentration in the medium of bone marrow derived macrophages increased by NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation by LPS+ATP, and decreased in macrophages pre-treated with ND-13, however, in the presence of LPS+Nigericin no effect was found. Peri- toneal macrophages from diabetic mice were obtained and ND-13 significantly reduced IL-1β release in LPS+ATP-activated BMDMs, confirming its inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In STZ mice, ND-13 and MCC950 normalized IL-1β production in peritoneal cells and attenuated renal damage. ND-13 and MCC950 decreased histologic evidence of tubular injury in STZ-induced dia- betes in mice. PAS staining showed an increase in db/db mice, sug- gesting possible tubular damage, which was compensated by ND-13 treatment. Gene expression analysis revealed that ND-13 downregu- lated pro-inflammatory ( ) and pro-fibrotic ( ) markers in renal tissue for STZ mice. Notably, PBMCs from patients with diabetic nephropathy showed increased IL-1β release compared to diabetic patients without complications, highlighting the clinical relevance of NLRP3 activation in the progression of DN.

**Conclusion:**
The findings highlight NLRP3 inflammasome activa- tion in peripheral immune cells as a critical mechanism driving dia- betic nephropathy. ND-13 emerged as a promising therapeutic agent, effectively reducing inflammasome activity, inflammation and kidney damage in both experimental and human models. These results sup- port the potential of targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome, particularly with DJ-1-derived compounds such as ND-13, for the prevention and treatment of DN.

**Fecal microbiota transplantation improves diabetic kidney dis- ease by regulating gut tryptophan metabolism**

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major microvascular complication of diabetes, with complex pathogenesis and limited effectiveness of current prevention and treatment strate- gies. Identifying novel therapeutic approaches and their molecular targets is therefore of critical clinical significance. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the prevention and treat- ment of DKD.

**Materials and methods:**
This study was conducted across population, animal, and cellular levels. Metagenomics, serum metabolomics, and tryptophan-targeted metabolomics were employed to analyze changes in gut microbiota composition and serum metabolic flux in both human subjects and DKD mouse models. An 18-week FMT treatment was administered to db/db mice, during which dynamic changes in glucose and lipid metabolism, renal function, and inflammatory markers were evaluated. Renal tissues were collected for transcriptomic sequencing and pathological analysis. Molecular biological techniques, includ- ing western blotting, immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assays, and gene overexpression/knockdown, were used to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of FMT in ameliorating DKD.

**Results:**
FMT effectively improved glucose and lipid metabolism dis- orders, reduced urinary microalbumin levels, delayed renal function decline, and alleviated renal inflammatory infiltration in db/db mice. In addition, FMT normalized the altered gut microbiota composition and structure in db/db mice, particularly restoring microbial popula- tions associated with gut tryptophan metabolism. This intervention significantly modulated the abnormal serum tryptophan metabolic flux observed in db/db mice. Elevated serum levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in the DKD state were closely associated with metabolic dis- orders and renal dysfunction. Mechanistically, IAA promoted NEMO SUMOylation, leading to activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which further exacerbated renal inflammatory damage. FMT reduced IAA production, suppressed the activation of the miR-145a-5p/SENP2 signaling axis, inhibited NEMO SUMOylation, and mitigated the excessive activation of the NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway.

**Conclusion:**
In DKD, increased NEMO SUMOylation activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in renal inflammatory injury. The gut-derived tryptophan metabolite IAA upregulates renal miR-145a-5p expression, which further enhances NEMO SUMOylation via the miR- 145a-5p/SENP2 axis, aggravating inflammatory damage. FMT allevi- ates DKD and its associated inflammatory injuries by regulating gut tryptophan metabolism, reducing IAA production, and inhibiting the miR-145a-5p/SENP2/NEMO-SUMOylation axis.

**Background and aims:**
Serum levels of neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1) positively correlates with the 10-years risk of developing end stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Moreover, NBL1 causes podocyte death, . The aim of our study was to test whether NBL1 blocking agents could prevent podocyte death, , and delay diabetic kidney dis- ease (DKD) onset, .

**Materials and methods:**
We screened a library of NBL1 inhibitors through phage display by using an cell death assay, which measured NBL1-induced apoptosis of human immortalized podo- cytes. Stem cell-derived human kidney organoids were used as trans- lational model. NBL1 inhibitors were tested, , in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DKD and in Db/Db mice. Efficacy of NBL1 blocking agents was evaluated by quantifying mesangial expansion, pro-fibrotic response, expression of podocyte-specific markers and by measuring urinary creatinine and albumin.

**Results:**
Our study demonstrated that NBL1 inhibitor markedly reduced NBL1-induced podocyte death, , and rescued the expression of podocyte markers in human kidney organoids. More importantly, when administered , NBL1 inhibitors reduced uri- nary albumin and creatinine, mesangial expansion, and renal fibrosis, thus preventing the development of DKD.

**Conclusion:**
Novel therapies aimed at blocking/delaying DKD onset and/or progression to ESKD in patients with diabetes are still needed. Our findings demonstrate that NBL1 inhibition protects diabetic mice from renal damage by preventing podocyte death, thereby confirming NBL1 as novel therapeutic target for DKD.

**Background and aims:**
Intrarenal oxidative stress plays a critical pathological role in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). There is increas- ing evidence for the pro-oxidant NADPH oxidase NOX5, an enzyme that is present in humans but absent in rodents, playing a critical role in DKD. However, the previous studies have been limited to transgenic mouse models expressing human Nox5 due to the absence of the Nox5 gene in rodents. Fortunately, Nox5 is present in the rabbit, and thus rabbit represents an ideal model to study the biological role of NOX5 in DKD.We aimed to generate a novel Nox5 knockout rabbit and com- prehensively investigate the role of NOX5 on renal injury in diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We generated a unique Nox5 knockout rab- bit using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. WT and homozygous NOX5 KO rabbits at age 8-10 weeks were randomized to receive a single dose of alloxan iv injection (150 mg/kg) to induce diabetes or saline alone to serve as controls. After sixteen weeks of diabetes, all the rabbits were humanely euthanized and kidneys, and plasma and urine sam- ples were collected for analysis of relevant renal parameters including albuminuria, renal injury, fibrosis, oxidative and ER-stress as well as cellular apoptosis.

**Results:**
Alloxan induced diabetic WT-rabbits showed an increase in urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR, >13-fold), glomerulosclerosis (mesangial expansion, 2-fold) and renal fibrosis (fibronectin, ~6-fold increase) in association with increased renal ROS production (nitroty- rosine, >5-fold), ER stress (CHOP, >6-fold) and apoptosis (Bax/Bcl2, ~6-fold) compared to non-diabetic controls. All these aforementioned parameters were significantly attenuated in the diabetic Nox5 KO rab- bits, such as ACR by ~70%, fibrosis by 25%, ROS and ER stress by ~75% and ~55%, respectively, as well as apoptosis by ~75%.

**Conclusion:**
These novel findings validate for the first time that NOX5 plays a critical pathogenic role in diabetic kidney disease as a result of increased ROS, ER stress and apoptosis. Therefore, NOX5 represents a likely promising novel therapeutic target in human diabetic kidney disease.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a severe micro- vascular complication of diabetes, is a major cause of mortality among diabetic patients. It is characterized by chronic kidney inflammation, tubular atrophy, and progressive renal dysfunction. Pericytes play an important role in kidney vascular function. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase of p53, has been implicated in podo- cyte injury and inflammatory regulation. However, the role of MDM2 in pericytes in regulating kidney inflammation and injury during DN, as well as the underlying pathways involved, remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of pericyte-specific MDM2 knockout on renal function and inflammation in DN.

**Materials and methods:**
Pericyte-specific MDM2 knockout (MDM2- KO) mice were generated using the Cre-loxP system. Kidney tissue, blood, and urine samples were collected after three months of diabetes. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and PCR were employed to evaluate kidney function, injury, and inflamma- tory genes across four groups of mice (wild-type nondiabetic control (WT-NC), wild-type diabetic control (WT-DC), pericyte MDM2-KO non diabetic control (KO-NC) and MDM2-KO diabetic animals (KO- DC). The NF-κB signaling pathways, associated with inflammation and MDM2, were also analyzed.

**Results:**
Improved kidney function was observed in MDM2-KO dia- betic mice. Western blot revealed a significant increase in the apop- tosis markers Annexin V and Cleaved-caspase 3, as well as the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1, in the kidneys of WT-DC mice, which were suppressed in KO-DC mice. PCR analysis showed elevated mRNA levels of several inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in WT-DC mice, which were markedly inhibited in MDM2-deficient KO-DC mice. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated a reduction in macrophage infiltration in the kidneys of diabetic MDM2-KO mice. Increased expression of NF-κB (p65), phosphorylated IκBα (P-IκBα), and nuclear translocation of p65 observed in WT-DC mice were significantly suppressed in KO-DC mice.

**Conclusion:**
Pericyte-specific MDM2 knockout improves kidney function and significantly alleviates renal apoptosis, inflammation and immune cell infiltration in DN. MDM2 regulates kidney inflammation in DN through the NF-κB signaling pathways. Inhibition of MDM2 may offer potential therapeutic benefits for DN patients in clinical practice.

**Finerenone alleviates diabetic nephropathy by improving lipid metabolism reprogramming of renal tubular epithelial cells**

H. Guo

**Background and aims:**
Lipid metabolism imbalance is an impor- tant mechanism underlying the development of diabetic nephropa- thy, which is a major cause of end-stage renal diseases worldwide. However, the specific mechanisms of lipid metabolism repro- gramming-induced kidney damage remain unclear and there is no standard treatment method for this condition. In this study, the role of abnormal cellular metabolic pathways in the development of diabetic nephropathy and the renal protective mechanism of finer- enone, a new non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, were explored.

**Materials and methods:**
Five-to-six-week-old db/db spontaneous diabetic mice were selected for the construction of carbohydrate response element-binding protein-β (ChREBP-β) specific overexpres- sion mouse models (ChREBP-β-KT), which were given finerenone intervention for 12 weeks. HK-2 cells were cultured in high glu- cose, and primary renal tubular epithelial cells were extracted from ChREBP-β-KT mice. These two types of cells were then treated with finerenone. The general condition, urine protein, and renal pathologi- cal changes of the mice, lipid metabolism indicators, lipid peroxida- tion metabolites, and lipid deposition in renal tissue and renal tubular epithelial cells were detected. Tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitative proteomics analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, and luciferase reporter gene experiments were used to investigate the regulatory effect of ChREBP-β on acyl-coenzyme A synthase 4 (ACSL4).

**Results:**
Finerenone reduced the levels of urinary protein excretion (UAE) and n-acetylglutamate (NAG) in mice fed with high-fructose diet, significantly alleviated the renal pathological changes, and improved the abnormal lipid metabolism in renal tubular epithelial cells. ChREBP-β is a key transcriptional activator that regulates glu- cose metabolism. Studies have demonstrated that ChREBP-β-KT mice exhibit ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells. ChREBP-β positively regulated long-chain ACSL4, which is a crucial factor in lipid metabolism, by promoting its gene transcription. Lipid peroxi- dation occurred in injured renal tubular epithelial cells induced by high glucose. Finerenone downregulated ChREBP-β, thereby reduc- ing ACSL4 gene transcription, alleviating high glucose-induced lipid peroxidation in renal tubular epithelial cells, and ultimately mitigat- ing renal injury.

**Conclusion:**
Finerenone targets the ChREBP-β/ACSL4 axis to reverse lipid peroxidation in renal tubular epithelial cells and thus to alleviate kidney damage in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study results reveal that finerenone can regulate cellular metabolism and relieve diabetic nephropathy and clarify related mechanisms.

**Background and aims:**
DKD affects 40% of T2D. Inflammation is a major contributor to DKD, offering the potential for establishing effective biomarkers. Promising biomarkers are tumor necrosis fac- tor receptor-1 and -2 (TNFR-1, -2). TNFα interacts with these recep- tors also found as soluble forms (sTNFR1, sTNFR2). This observa- tional, prospective, monocentric study evaluated the effects of TNFα, sTNFR-1 and -2 on DKD progression, incidence of CV events and all-cause death in a cohort of T2D stratified by DKD phenotypes based on eGFR and uACR.

**Materials and methods:**
Overall, 256 T2D were recruited in 2018- 2021: 67 had uACR <30 mg/g and eGFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73m ; 63 uACR ≥30 and eGFR ≥60; 62 uACR <30 and eGFR <60, and 64 uACR ≥30 and eGFR <60. sTNFR-1 and -2 were measured by ELISA kits (RayBiotech, Inc., Peachtree Corners, GA), while TNFα by Simple Plex assay on ELLA automated immunoassay system. The primary kid- ney endpoint (K1) was a composite of eGFR decline ≥30%, eGFR <15, dialysis or kidney transplant, with or without uACR category progres- sion. Secondary endpoints were like K1 with eGFR decline ≥40% (K2) or ≥50% (K3), and uACR progression alone (K4). Exploratory were a composite of major CV events (E1), and all-cause death (E2). Sub- sequent Cox regression backwards models were run: the unadjusted; adjusted for age and sex (Model 1); Model 1 plus several confounders (Model 2); Model 2 plus DKD phenotypes (Model 3A); Model 2 plus uACR & eGFR (Model 3B).

**Results:**
The follow-up lasted 5.18 years, IQR 3.83-5.75. Biomarkers were: 1) moderately, directly correlated to uACR (p<0.0001), steeply increasing from A1 to A3; 2) strongly, inversely correlated with eGFR (p<0.0001), steeply increasing from G1 to G4; and 3) steeply increas- ing across DKD phenotypes (p<0.0001). K1 occurred in 86 subjects (34.0%), K2 in 66 (26.1%), K3 in 58 (22.9%), K4 in 45 (18.9%), E1 in 32 (12.6%), E2 in 13 (5.1%), defined “progressors”. Progressors to K1 were older, had higher BMI, increased triglycerides, fibrinogen and hsCRP, and more severe kidney damage, including higher rate of advanced DKD phenotypes. Progressors to K1, K2 and K3 (p<0.0001) and to K4 and E1 (p<0.01, at least) showed higher baseline levels of TNFα, sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2. In Cox unadjusted, each unit increase in ln TNFα, ln sTNFR-1 but not sTNFR-2 was associated with a 2 to 3 times higher risk of K1 to K4 (p<0.05 at least). In Model 2, both TNFα and sTNFR-1 remained independent covariates of K1 (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.08-3.73, p=0.027; and HR 1.83, 1.14-2.93, p=0.012, respectively) as well of K2, K3, and, marginally for TNFα, K4). Consistently, in both Model 3A and 3B, both TNFα and sTNFR-1 were independent covariates of K1 (with the same HRs) as well of K2, K3, and K4. Ln sTNFR-2 emerged as an independent covariate of the incidence of major CV events in Model 2 (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.35-5.23, p=0.005), Model 3A (with the same HR) and Model 3B (HR 2.12, 1.03-4.35, p=0.04). Finally, for E2, an independent role was observed for TNFα, with marginal roles for sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2.

**Conclusion:**
Thus, TNFα, and mostly sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2 are con- firmed as emerging predictors of DKD progression and incidence of CV events in T2D, independently of a large set of confounders includ- ing the hallmarks of kidney damage.

**Unravelling diabetic kidney disease: the mitochondrial and immune cell connection**

T. Zhang

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a multifac- torial complication of diabetes involving mitochondrial dysfunction and immune cell infiltration. However, the causal relationships remain unclear.

**Materials and methods:**
We applied Mendelian randomization (MR) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the roles of mitochondrial gene expression and immune cells in DKD. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from DKD patients were analyzed for differential gene expression.

**Results:**
Higher expression of mitochondrial genes PCCB, ACADM, ADHFE1, OCIAD1, and FIS1 increased DKD risk, while genes like NT5DC2, ATP5MC3, and GLYCTK decreased risk. Immune traits, including HLA-DR+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells, mediated the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on DKD. scRNA-seq revealed significant downregulation of ATP5MC3, GLYCTK, and NT5DC2 in podocytes and tubular cells in DKD kidneys, alongside increased infiltration of helper T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and plasma cells. PBMC analy- sis highlighted the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (CXCL2, CXCL3, and others) in DKD patients.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the complex interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and immune cell infiltration in DKD pathogenesis. Key mitochondrial genes and immune traits identified here offer novel therapeutic targets for early intervention and disease management.

**Background and aims:**
The endogenous opioid proenkephalin (PENK) has been identified as an independent risk marker for acute cardiovascular diseases and acute kidney injury (AKI). However, its regulation, its association with other cardiometabolic markers, and its prognostic role in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not been thoroughly investigated.

**Materials and methods:**
PENK serum levels were cross-sectionally related to renal and cardiometabolic markers across three large cohorts (total N=4,722), including the Leipzig-CKD cohort (N=581), as well as the population-based LIFE-Adult (N=3,093) and Sorbs (N=1,048) cohort. Furthermore, a longitudinal analysis was performed in the Leip- zig-CKD cohort to assess the association between circulating PENK levels at baseline and a composite 4-point major adverse renal events (4P-MARE)-endpoint comprising incident or worsening kidney dis- ease, development of end-stage kidney failure requiring kidney replace- ment therapy or kidney transplantation, and renal deaths.

**Results:**
In the entire cross-sectional cohort (N=4,722), PENK levels were strongly and inversely correlated with markers of renal function, i.e. estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), creatinine, urinary albumin creatinine ratio (uACR). In multivariate analysis, eGFR was the strongest, independent, inverse predictor of circulating PENK levels after adjustment for age, sex, and markers of obesity, glucose intoler- ance, dyslipidemia, and inflammation. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that baseline circulating PENK levels were strongly associated with an increased risk of the 4P-MARE over a median fol- low-up of 8.7 (p)years. Each doubling of PENK levels was associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of developing 4P-MARE, even after adjusting for various clinical and metabolic variables. PENK provided added value for predicting adverse renal outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
PENK levels are strongly, independently, and inversely associated with renal function in cross-sectional analysis. Further- more, baseline circulating PENK levels are predictive of a 4P-MARE in patients and added independent, prognostic value for identification of patients at risk for adverse renal outcomes.

**The effect of combined assessment of urinary L-FABP and urinary albumin in the evaluation of diabetic kidney disease in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes**

H. Satoh, T. Katahira, D. Sugimoto

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Albuminuria is a predictor of the progression of diabetic nephropathy. However, it has recently been reported that diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes may progress without exac- erbation of albuminuria. On the other hand, urinary liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) has been reported to correlate with the severity of the tubuleinterstitial damage and with the progression of chronic kidney disease and furthermore, to reflect the progression of diabetic nephropathy and to be useful for early detection of acute kidney injury. Therefore, we investigated whether combined assess- ment of urinary L-FABP and albuminuria can predict the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

**Materials and methods:**
Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Setting: Single center study. Patients: In this study, we enrolled 1,582 patients with type 2 diabetes who visited our hospital for diabetes treat- ment from January 2016 to September 2024, in whom both albuminuria and urinary L-FABP levels were measured simultaneously. Main Out- come Measurements: urinary L-FABP, albuminuria, and eGFR

**Results:**
A total of 1,582 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this study. The characteristics were (means ± SD) age: 66.8 ± 13.4 years, body mass index: 26.4 ± 4.4 kg/m , HbA1c: 7.72 ± 1.75%, eGFR: 73.4 ± 27.0 mL/min/1.73m , urinary albumin: 245.7 ± 792.5 mg/gCr, urinary L-FABP: 12.8 ± 72.8 μg/gCr. Urinary L-FABP levels increased signifi- cantly in dependence on a decrease in eGFR (Urinary L-FABP levels: 6.47 ± 15.08 μg/gCr (60 eGFR), 12.18 ± 30.42 μg/gCr (45 eGFR<60), 43.90 ± 230.2 μg/gCr (30 eGFR<45), 67.21 ± 30.50 (eGFR<30); P < 0.01). And L-FABP levels also increased significantly in dependence on exacerbation of albuminuria (Urinary L-FABP levels: 3.49 ± 4.18 μg/ gCr (Normoalbuminuria), 16.60 ± 122.16 μg/gCr (Microalbuminuria), 41.36 ± 58.82 μg/gCr (Macroalbuminuria); P < 0.01). On the other hand, as shown in Table, eGFR levels in the group with macroalbuminuria and normal urinary L-FABP levels were significantly lower than those in the group with normoalbuminuria and normal urinary L-FABP levels. And eGFR levels in the group with elevated urinary L-FABP levels and normoalbuminuria were also significantly lower than those in the group with normoalbuminuria and normal urinary L-FABP levels. Further- more, eGFR levels in the group with high urinary L-FABP levels and macroalbuminuria were the lowest in all groups.

**Conclusion:**
These results suggest that combined assessment of uri- nary L-FABP levels and albuminuria levels might be useful for assess- ing the progression of diabetic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.

2. Zhengzhou, China, Department of endocrinology, People’s Hospital

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), one of the most severe microvascular complications of diabetes and a leading cause of global end-stage renal disease, is characterized by renal fibro- sis. However, the mechanisms driving fibrosis remain incompletely elucidated. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota dysbiosis is closely linked to diabetes and its complications through systemic inflammation, metabolic disturbances, and disruption of redox homeo- stasis. Additionally, gut microbiota influences ferroptosis in various diseases, but whether it affects ferroptosis in DKD-related renal fibrosis remains unknown. This case-control study investigated the interplay among gut microbiota, metabolites, fibrosis, and ferroptosis in DKD by analyzing clinical data, microbial profiles, and metabolic profiles from three groups: DKD patients, diabetes patients without complications (DM), and healthy controls (HC). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) into germ-free mice further explored the role of dysregulated gut microbiota in renal fibrosis via ferroptosis.

**Materials and methods:**
Sixty DKD patients, 30 DM patients, and 30 HC subjects were enrolled. Blood samples were analyzed for clinical, inflammatory, fibrotic, and ferroptosis-related markers (e.g., MCP-1/ CCL2, α-SMA, TGF-β, MDA, GPX4). Fecal samples underwent 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics. Bioinformatics and statistical methods integrated multi-omics data. Humanized microbiota mouse models were established via FMT to assess renal function, fibrosis, and ferroptosis.

**Results:**
Compared to HC, DKD patients exhibited progressive renal dysfunction, elevated inflammatory (MCP-1), fibrotic (α-SMA, TGF- β), and ferroptosis markers ( MDA, GPX4; P<0.05). Gut microbiota diversity and structure significantly differed in DKD (P<0.05), with reduced abundance of Lachnoclostridium (ASV96) and Megamonas (ASV101). Metabolomic analysis revealed dysregulated metabolites (e.g., 5-Acetamidovalerate). Multi-omics correlations showed Lachno- clostridium and Megamonas negatively correlated with UACR, MCP-1, α-SMA, TGF-β, and 5-Acetamidovalerate but positively with GPX4. In mice, DKD-FMT groups displayed higher blood glucose, elevated UACR (P<0.05), severe renal structural damage (HE staining), glomer- ular basement membrane thickening (PAS staining), and aggravated fibrosis (Masson and Sirius red staining). DKD-FMT mice also showed reduced Bacteroides (ASV330) and Muribaculaceae_Incertae_Sedis (ASV231/343). Tight junction proteins (Claudin-1, ZO-1) were low- est in DKD-FMT (P<0.05). KEGG enrichment highlighted ferroptosis pathway activation (P<0.05), with DKD-FMT mice showing GPX4, FTL, and SLC7A11/TGF-β mRNA (P<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Dysregulated gut microbiota and metabolites may pro- mote renal fibrosis in DKD by modulating ferroptosis.

**Association of serum total bilirubin to cholesterol ratio with pro- gression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study**

L. Chen, Y. ­Chen, S. ­Wang, H. ­Guo, F. ­Han, B. ­Sun, N. ­Li, H., ­Yang

**Background and aims:**
To explore the influence of the serum total bilirubin to total cholesterol (TBIL/TC) ratio on the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
The present retrospective discovery cohort investigated 4,282 patients. The exposure was baseline TBIL/TC ratio. The outcome was the first time to progressing CKD, defined by a drop in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) category, along with a reduction in eGFR of at least 25% compared to the baseline value. Hazard ratios (HRs) for CKD progression was evaluated based on the Cox proportional hazards approach. Dose-response relationships was conducted using Restricted Cubic Splines (RCS). Additionally, 758 patients were enrolled as an independent validation cohort.

**Results:**
During a median observation period of 2.4 years (interquar- tile range 1.3-3.8 years) within the discovery cohort, 522 individuals showed progression in CKD. The analysis revealed a negative asso- ciation between the TBIL/TC ratio and the risk of CKD progression, with an adjusted HR of 0.17 and a 95% CI ranging from 0.07 to 0.41. After adjusting for confounding variables, the HRs for the second, third, and fourth quartiles of the TBIL/TC ratio were recorded at 0.61 (95% CI 0.48, 0.78), 0.55 (95% CI 0.42, 0.72), and 0.55 (95% CI 0.41, 0.74), respectively. RCS analyses exhibited a nonlinear association with TBIL/TC ratio and renal outcome, and further indicated that the optimal TBIL/TC ratio threshold was 0.25%. Similar results were also observed in the validation cohort.

**Conclusion:**
A relative higher TBIL/TC ratio was significantly associ- ated with a reduced risk of CKD progression. Therefore, it could serve as a novel marker for stratifying CKD risk and monitoring progression in patients with type 2 diabetes.

1. Tashkent Pediatric Medical Institute, Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Tashkent

**Background and aims:**
To assess the impact of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction on the development of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients with type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
The dynamics of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and antioxidant system (AOS) markers and endothelial function were studied in 65 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who had a high risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) during endovascular radiographic contrast procedures (EVRCP). The mean age of the patients was 56.64±1.07 years, and the average duration of diabetes was 16.4±1.28 years. The following parameters were assessed: HbA1c: 10.1 ± 0.2%, creatinine: 91.3 ± 1.57 μmol/L, MDA: 3.97 ± 0.24 nmol/mL, SOD: 1042.78 ± 46.99 U/gHb, catalase: 7.65 ± 0.17 U/act, NO metabolites (NOx): 16.34 ± 0.76μmol/L, and ET-1: 1.19 ± 0.04 fmol/mL. These markers were measured before contrast administra- tion and on the 5th and 10th days after the procedure. For CI-AKI prevention, patients received either acetylcysteine (Group A, n=34) or theophylline (Group T, n=31); the values of 20 healthy individuals were used as normal controls.

**Results:**
Before undergoing EVRCP, patients with type 2 diabetes showed a marked imbalance in the LPO and AOS compared to the con- trol group: plasma MDA levels were elevated several-fold (p<0.001). At the same time, SOD and catalase activity were significantly reduced (p<0.001). At the same time, signs of endothelial dysfunction were observed: NO metabolites (NOx) were approximately two times lower than normal values, and ET-1 levels were three times higher (p<0.001). These disturbances worsened by the 5th day after contrast administra- tion: MDA increased further, SOD and catalase activity decreased, NOx levels dropped, and ET-1 levels rose compared to baseline (p<0.001). The peak MDA level on day 5 was accompanied by an increase in creatinine concentration (r≈0.84; p<0.01), confirming the pathogenic role of enhanced lipid peroxidation in the development of CI-AKI. By day 10, preventive therapy led to a tendency toward normalization: MDA levels returned to baseline, antioxidant enzyme activity increased, NOx levels rose, and ET-1 decreased. Both preven- tive approaches demonstrated a nephroprotective effect: NO production was better preserved in the acetylcysteine group, while ET-1 elevation was less pronounced in the theophylline group.

**Conclusion:**
Activation of lipid peroxidation and endothelial dysfunc- tion play a key role in the development of CI-AKI in patients with diabetes. The imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants, along with impaired vascular regulation, contributes to kidney damage, high- lighting the need for targeted preventive measures.

**Background and aims:**
Existing methods to estimate kidney func- tion in people with diabetes has shown to underestimate measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR), the gold standard technique. This study aimed to develop and validate an artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning algorithm - RenoTrue for estimating kidney function in people with diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Data were collated from five collaborating international cohorts with 11, 138 datapoints from 5,619 individu- als that included people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with direct measurements of kidney function (mGFR). mGFR was measured using clearance of exogenous filtration markers. The international cohort was then split into training (70%), validation (10%) and test (20%) datasets. RenoTrue was developed to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using age, sex, and serum creatinine as input variables. The perfor- mance of RenoTrue was evaluated by (a) estimating an intraclass cor- relation coefficient (ICC), bias (mean difference), and accuracy (p10, p15 & p30) between mGR and RenoTrue estimates in the test dataset, and (b) compared to CKD-EPI estimates of performance through a multi-level mixed effect regression model.

**Results:**
In the overall dataset, median mGFR was 75 ml/ min per 1.73m [Inter Quartile Range (IQR): 49, 100], median age was 59 years [IQR: 38, 69] and 3357 (60%) people with type 2 diabetes were included in the analysis. In the test dataset, RenoTrue indicated high agreement (ICC: 0.87) and low bias with a mean difference of -0.57 ml/ min per 1.73m to mGFR measurements. Regarding accuracy, 39% and 81% of RenoTrue estimates were within 10% and 30% range of their respective mGFR measurements. In comparison, the 2009 CKD-EPI equation had ICC of 0.86, mean difference of 4.17 ml/min per 1.73m , 33% and 74% of estimates within 10% and 30% of their respective mGFR measurements.

**Conclusion:**
For people with diabetes, RenoTrue demonstrated simi- lar agreement but lower bias (mean difference), and higher accuracy compared to the 2009 CKD-EPI equation for estimating direct meas- urements of GFR.

**Prognostic significance of stress hyperglycaemia ratio for renal outcomes in patients with type 1 diabetic nephropathy**

Y. Wang

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic nephropathy is a common and major complication in patients with type 1 diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), a novel indicator of acute blood glucose fluctuations, for predicting renal out- comes in patients with type 1 diabetic nephropathy.

**Materials and methods:**
In this single-center retrospective study, adult patients with type 1 diabetic nephropathy hospitalized between Janu- ary 2020 and March 2023 were included. The SHR was calculated from the admission blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin A1C. The primary outcomes were decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 30%, end-stage kidney disease or all-cause mortality. Restricted cubic spline analysis and Cox proportional hazards regres- sion analysis were applied for statistical analysis.

**Results:**
A total of 89 patients with a mean age of 31 years, 66.29% were men, and mean eGFR of 49 ml/min/1.73m , were included. Dur- ing a median follow-up period of 33 months, a total of 38 (42.70%) reached the primary endpoint. Restricted cubic spline curve indicated a U-shaped association between SHR and the primary outcome, with the nadir point at SHR =0.98. Multi-variate Cox analysis indicated that the hazards ratio and 95% confidence intervals for SHR < 0.81 and SHR > 1.09 were 2.84 (1.52-3.42) and 2.32 (1.22-3.09), respectively.

**Conclusion:**
A higher or lower SHR is related to unfavorable out- comes in patients with type 1 diabetic nephropathy, highlighting that maintaining SHR within 0.81-1.09 may be beneficial for improving outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious microvascular complication of diabetes and is associated with kid- ney fibrosis. Renal fibrosis, characterized by tubulointerstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis,can ultimately lead to end-stage kidney fail- ure. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2), a negative regulator of p53, is upregulated in pericytes of diabetic kidney. However, the role of MDM2 in pericytes for fibrotic injury in DN still remains unclear. This study aims to explore the effects of pericyte-specific MDM2 knockout on renal function and fibrotic damages in DN.

**Materials and methods:**
Pericyte specific MDM2 knockout (MDM2- KO) mice were generated using Cre/loxP system by intercrossing ­mdm2 and pdgfβr transgenic mice with genetic background C57BL/6. Genotype and gene exppression were determined by PCR. Experimental animals were divided into four groups: wildtype (WT) and MDM2-KO controls, WT and MDM2-KO diabetes. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single high dose of 140 mg/kg strep- tozotocin and mice were kept for six months. Metabolic data (blood sugar, body weight and HbA1C) were monitored monthly. Urine albu- min-creatinine ratio (uACR) was employed to evaluate kidney func- tion. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured using invitrogen colorimetric detection kit. MDM2 and fibrotic protein expression were detected by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and Western blot.

**Results:**
Pericyte conditional MDM2-KO mice was reduced MDM2 expression. MDM2-KO had no effect on body weight and blood sugar, but it reduced HbA1C and BUN levels. Hyperglycemia increased uACR, while pericyte MDM2-KO reduced uACR, indicating improved renal function. In addition, diabetes promoted the deposition of renal fibrotic proteins, whereas MDM2-KO inhibited the accumulation of fibrotic proteins collagen and alpha smooth muscle actin. More impor- tantly, MDM2-KO in pericytes alleviated glomerulosclerosis.

**Conclusion:**
Pericyte-specific MDM2 knockout improves kidney func- tion and significantly alleviates glomerulosclerosis in DN. MDM2 modulates fibrotic process in diabetic kidney. Inhibition of MDM2 may offer potential therapeutic benefits for patients with DN.

**Background and aims:**
Lysine crotonylation (Kcr), a recently identi- fied post-translational modification, has been implicated in the patho- genesis of various renal disorders, yet its involvement in diabetic kid- ney disease (DKD) remains poorly characterized. This study aims to unravel the pathophysiological role of Kcr in driving DKD progression and to investigate its mechanistic underpinnings in renal tubular injury and functional decline.

**Materials and methods:**
Quantitative crotonylome profiling using TMT-labeled proteomics was performed in high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced DKD mice. The functional impact of ubiquitin- specific peptidase 15​ (USP15) lysine 39 crotonylation (USP15 K39- Kcr) on NF-κB pathway was validated in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs), DKD murine models. Structural and functional analyses, including site-directed mutagenesis and ubiquitination assays, were employed to unravel the molecular interplay between USP15 K39-Kcr and TGFβ activated kinase 1 (TAK1) binding proteins 2 (TAB2) sta- bility. Additionally, structure-based virtual screening was conducted to identify small-molecule inhibitors targeting USP15 K39-Kcr.

**Results:**
Crotonylation was globally upregulated in DKD kidneys, with crotonylome profiling revealing 7780 lysine Kcr sites spanning 2315 proteins, including the USP15 K39 residue. Mechanistically, USP15 K39-Kcr disrupted TAB2 ubiquitination by promoting the USP15- TAB2 interaction, thereby stabilizing TAB2 to sustain hyperactivation of the NF-κB pathway and amplify pro-inflammatory cytokine release in RTECs. Allantoin, from structure-based virtual screening, pharma- cologically suppressed USP15 K39-Kcr, reinstated TAB2 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and mitigated NF-κB-dependent inflammatory responses.

**Conclusion:**
USP15 K39-Kcr drives DKD progression by stabiliz- ing TAB2 and amplifying NF-κB-mediated inflammation in RTECs. Allantoin emerges as a promising inhibitor targeting this modification, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for DKD. These findings provide mechanistic insights into inflammation regulation in DKD and high- light the translational potential of modulating crotonylation-dependent pathways.

**Mechanistic study on the pathogenic role of cell division autoanti- gen 1 in diabetic kidney disease in Akita mice**

M. Huang

**Background and aims:**
TGF-β is a key driver of renal fibrosis in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, directly targeting TGF-β may result in unacceptable adverse effects due to its involvement in essential biological processes. Our previous findings demonstrate that targeting cell division autoantigen 1 (CDA1) effectively mitigates DKD development by attenuating—but not completely blocking—the TGF-β/Smad pathway in STZ-diabetic ApoE knockout mice. Since no single animal model fully replicates human DKD, validating CDA1’s role in a different model, such as Akita mouse, would enhance the robustness of experimental conclusions. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of CDA1 deletion in reducing DKD progression in Akita mice. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling (RNA-seq) of kid- ney tissues was conducted to systematically identify CDA1-regulated signaling pathways.

**Materials and methods:**
Heterozygous Ins2 Akita mice were used to cross with CDA1 knockout (KO) mice to generate a new hybrid mouse strain, Akita/CDA1 KO. This strain would produce experimental male mice with all the genotypes required for this study (n=15-20/group), including 1) non-diabetic CDA1 WT ­(Ins2 /CDA1 ); 2) diabetic CDA1 WT ­(Ins2 /CDA1 ); 3) non-diabetic CDA1 KO ­(Ins2 / CDA1 ); 4) Diabetic CDA1 KO ­(Ins2 /CDA1 ). Kidney samples were collected at 10, 16, and 20 weeks of age to assess glomerular injury, as well as the expression levels of TGF-β, TGF-β Type I recep- tor (TGFBR1), TGF-β Type II receptor (TGFBR2), phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3), and downstream profibrotic and proinflammatory markers. RNA-seq was performed using total RNA isolated from kid- ney tissues at 16 weeks of age (n = 6/group).

**Results:**
At 16 weeks, Akita mice demonstrated significant renal injury, characterized by a 2.9-fold elevation in albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), a 1.7-fold increase in glomerulosclerosis index (GSI), and a 2-fold upregulation of profibrotic markers. CDA1 deletion markedly attenuates these alterations, resulting in a 30% reduction in ACR, a 29% decrease in GSI, and normalization of collagen I and collagen III expression to near non-diabetic control levels. Notably, the renopro- tective effects of CDA1 deletion were more pronounced at 20 weeks, with further reductions in ACR and GSI. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CDA1’s role in DKD, the results demonstrated that CDA1 deletion attenuated TGF-β/Smad pathway by reducing dia- betes-induced TGFBR1 and p-Smad3 expression at 20 weeks. RNA- seq analysis confirmed the modulatory effects of CDA1 deletion on fibrosis-related pathways and identified multiple diabetes-associated pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, comple- ment and coagulation cascades, AGE-RAGE pathway in diabetic com- plications, and TNF signaling pathway. Notably, CDA1 deletion down- regulated cell cycle-related genes, particularly the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a key regulator of cellular senescence in DKD. Consistent with RNA-seq findings, immunohistochemistry and qPCR analyses confirmed a marked elevation of p21 protein and mRNA lev- els in Akita mice at all examined time points, whereas CDA1 deletion effectively attenuated this diabetes-induced p21 overexpression.

**Conclusion:**
Targeting CDA1 effectively attenuated diabetes-associ- ated glomerular injury and fibrosis in Akita mice, providing a rationale for developing CDA1 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic strategy for DKD.

**Background and aims:**
Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, plays a critical role in stabilizing microtubules, and abnormal phosphoryla- tion contributes to tau aggregation and cytoskeletal destruction, which induces neurological diseases. However, the relationship and role of tau phosphorylation in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DKD) are not well understood.

**Materials and methods:**
DKD was induced in mice expressing renal podocyte-specific human NADPH oxidase 5 ( ­pod mice) by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 3, 6, and 12 weeks. To determine the association between tau phosphorylation and kidney injury, we assessed pTau levels in kidneys, serum, and urine from wild-type (WT) and ­pod mice. studies were performed in HK-2 cells treated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (5 ng/ml) with or without tau siRNA or TAOKi, tau phosphorylation inhibitor.

**Results:**
In animal studies, HFD induced albuminuria, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and kidney fibrosis. In both WT and ­pod mice, tau phosphorylation was significantly higher in the HFD group than in the RD group. In addition, tau phosphorylation in the ­pod group was further increased compared to WT mice under both RD and HFD conditions. Expression of ­pTau was most significantly increased in HFD group. study showed that TGF-β1-induced fibrosis or thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticu- lum (ER) stress increased tau phosphorylation, but inhibition of tau phosphorylation or ER stress resolved cellular damage in mesangial cells.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that tau phosphorylation is involved in the development and progression of DKD, and that regula- tion of tau phosphorylation and ER stress may be therapeutic targets for DKD.

**Background and aims:**
Current therapies for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) primarily focus on lowering blood pressure and stabilizing blood glucose but for people living with diabetes there is a critical need for novel therapies, particularly for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a key molecule in immune cell activation and sustainment of inflammatory responses in DKD. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of targeting RAGE in diabetic kidney disease, by specifically evaluating its effects on the immune cell compartment in a novel outbred preclinical model.

**Materials and methods:**
Diabetes was induced in groups (n=12) of outbred male CD-1 mice (6-8 weeks old) followed by intragastric therapy at 10 weeks age: (i) RAGE antagonist Azeliragon (Az) (3 mg/ kg/day, 3x per week), (ii) Ramipril (ACE inhibitor; 3mg/kg/day, 5x per week) and (iii) Placebo (3x per week) for a duration of 12 weeks. Kidney function was assessed via FITC-sinistrin-based glomerular filtration rate (mGFR), serum cystatin C, and urinary albumin-to-cre- atinine ratio (uACR). To assess immune cell profiling, kidneys, renal and mesenteric lymph nodes were dispersed, stained and measured using a multi-parameter flow cytometry. Data was normality tested, one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test was used with post-hoc test- ing as appropriate.

**Results:**
By 11-12 weeks of age, mice with confirmed diabetes showed evidence of kidney disease with ~5-fold increase in urinary albumin creatinine ratio (uACR) (p=0.0296), ~3-fold rise in glycated hemo- globin ­(HbA ) levels (p<0.0001) and ~40% higher glomerular filtra- tion (p=0.0084) vs no diabetes. Az improved kidney function by ~60% (mGFR; p=0.0337) compared to placebo group. Kidneys and lymph nodes from mice with diabetes showed increased RAGE expression on ­CD3 , ­CD4 and ­CD8 T cells and on tissue resident macrophages ­(CD11b F480 MHCII ), which was alleviated with Az treatment (Table 1). These changes were also observed in local lymph nodes, in which regulatory T cells ­(CD4 CD25 Foxp3 Tregs) significantly increased in Az-treated mice compared with mice with diabetes.

**Conclusion:**
Taken together, these findings suggest that RAGE antago- nism may improve kidney function, mitigate kidney inflammation and enhance immune regulation via Treg-mediated mechanisms. Further studies will investigate the mechanisms by which kidney and immune cell interactions contribute to inflammation in DKD and are alleviated by Az, a RAGE antagonist known to have a good safety profile in humans in previous Phase II clinical trials.

**Pharmacological benchmarking of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor and a dual sodium-glucose transport protein inhibitor in a non-human primate model of diabetic nephropathy**

F.P. de Villa

**Background and aims:**
Benchmarking against established drugs in non-human primates (NHP) enhances the translational value of preclinical studies. The NHP model of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) closely resembles human diabetic nephropathy, enabling more accurate efficacy and safety predictions. Irbesartan (IRB), a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, is the gold standard for proteinuria-driven nephropathy, validated by human trials. Con- versely, Sotagliflozin (STG), a dual sodium-glucose transport pro- tein (SGLT1/2) inhibitor, stands out for sustained renoprotection in early-to-moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) and offers additional cardiovascular benefits.

**Materials and methods:**
Male diabetic cynomolgus monkeys with CKD based on macroalbuminuria with moderate to severe glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction were selected for the study. The animals were administered daily oral doses via gavage for 4 weeks, receiving either vehicle (VEH, n=8), IRB at 3 mg/kg (n=12), or STG at weekly escalating doses of 10, 12, and 14 mg/ kg (n=5). Serial measurements of urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), GFR, and blood pressure (BP) were conducted throughout the study.

**Results:**
Reductions in UACR were observed in both the IRB and STG groups compared to the VEH group. Higher percent changes from baseline in UACR were recorded for the IRB group (-34±31%) compared to the STG (-3±5%) and VEH (+23±23%) groups. However, sustained reductions were noted at the end of the 4-week washout period for the STG (-7±53%) group compared to the IRB (+22±42%) group. The STG group also showed marked sustained improvement in GFR (+27±16%) at the end of the wash- out period compared to IRB (+16±93%). During dosing, the IRB group had decreases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), which returned to baseline by the end of the washout. Decreased SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and MAP, which persisted until the end of washout, were seen in the STG group.

**Conclusion:**
While IRB achieved greater acute albuminuria reduction, STG showed marked sustained GFR preservation after treatment ces- sation, suggesting divergent mechanisms of action. This NHP study positions IRB as the benchmark for acute albuminuria reduction and STG for sustained GFR preservation, highlighting complementary therapeutic niches. Pharmacological benchmarking should consider disease stage, mechanistic targets, and combination strategies to opti- mize diabetic nephropathy management.

**Background and aims:**
Tubular involvement is crucial in determin- ing diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Bisphenol A (BPA), an endo- crine-disrupting chemical plastizer excreted with urine, has been associated with the progression of renal disease. This study aimed to evaluate the role of BPA as driver of tubular impairment, its interaction with high glucose, and the involved intrinsic molecular response.

**Materials and methods:**
Human renal tubular epithelial cells HK-2 were exposed to normal (NG, 5.5mM) vs high (HG, 25mM) glucose in the absence or presence of increasing subtoxic BPA concentra- tions, previously assessed by crystal violet viability. Oxidative stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, inflammasome machinery and related intracellular key signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of DKD were evaluated by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence.

**Results:**
Comparative analysis of ­IC values showed a higher BPA inhibitory potency in HG than NG-exposed cells, especially in early stage of exposure (24h; 123 ± 2.2 uM 132 ± 2.8 uM, p<0.05). 50uM BPA treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both NG and HG exposed cells to a similar extent and, in turn, enhanced the transcription of antioxidant Nrf2-mediated genes NQO1 and HO1; the latter was significantly up-regulated in HG (3.4 ± 0.44 AU in HG 7.7 ± 1.1 AU in NG , p<0.0001). The HG milieu inten- sified BPA effects on inflammasome signaling, leading to a marked perinuclear NLRP3 activation (22.1 ± 4.2 AU in HG 9.1 ± 1.9 AU in NG, p<0.01), and potentiated BPA-induced EMT transition of HK-2 cells. Indeed, HG was associated with a reduced expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (1.9 ± 0.4 AU in HG 7.3 ± 1.5 AU in NG, p<0.01) and an overexpression of the mesenchimal markers ACTA-2 and fibronectin (20.7 ± 5.8 AU in HG 7.2 ± 2.0 AU in NG for ACTA-2, p<0.004; 9.8 ± 0.6 AU in HG 2.3 ± 0.2 AU in NG for fibronectin, p<0.001). Data were confirmed by immunofluorescence. Examining the intracellular signaling cascades, HG+BPA activated TGFβ1/Smad3 and JAK2/STAT3 pathways to a greater extent than NG+BPA. Interestingly, a BPA-induced increased nuclear translocation of p-NF-κB in HG-exposed cells was also observed.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, BPA treatment impaired HK-2 cells homeo- stasis through an increased oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory events and induced EMT process, primarily driven by the activation of JAK- STAT signaling pathway. These processes were strengthened under HG exposure, suggesting a putative association of endocrine disruptors and hyperglycemia in determining tubular damage.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease. Although oxidative stress is a key pathomecha- nism in the development of this complication, it remains insufficiently addressed in current therapeutic options. In T2D, the increased avail- ability of substrates enhances renal superoxide production via complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, making it a major source of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney. This study aimed to investigate the and effects of a novel mitochondrial complex I ROS modulator (CIM) on the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

**Materials and methods:**
experiments, including ROS assays, were carried out in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HRPTEC) treated with multiple concentrations of CIM. For studies, a short-term pilot study and a long-term intervention study were performed in db/db mice, a model of T2D. In the pilot study, 8-week-old db/db and db/+ (control) mice received CIM via oral gav- age at either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, twice daily. In the long-term DKD intervention study, 8-week-old db/db mice were randomized into two groups, receiving CIM via regular chow for 10 weeks, at either 20 mg/ kg or 60 mg/kg chow. Metabolic parameters were assessed, and renal cortex was collected at the end of the studies for immunohisto- chemistry (glomerulosclerosis index), citrate synthase activity (CSA) determination and measurements of mitochondrial respiration using high-resolution respirometry. Additionally, plasma cystatin C levels and urinary albumin-creatinine-ratio (uACR) were measured at baseline and the end of the long-term intervention study.

**Results:**
CIM significantly reduced ROS generation in HRPTEC in a concentration-dependent manner ­(IC ~ 1 μM). Short-term treat- ment with CIM significantly reduced CSA (by 10%, p < 0.05, 2-way ANOVA) in renal cortex of db/db mice, indicating a potential decrease in mitochondrial content. However, CIM treatment rescued complex I- and II-linked mitochondrial respiration (by 35-60%, p < 0.05, 2-way ANOVA) in renal cortex of diabetic mice. During the 10-week inter- vention study, CIM treatment had no effect on body composition, food intake, or blood glucose levels. CIM at 20 mg/kg significantly decreased uACR (by 30%, p < 0.05, 2-way ANOVA), but worsened the glomerulosclerosis index (by 20-30%, p < 0.01, 1-way ANOVA) in db/db mice. No effect on mitochondrial respiration was observed in renal cortex of db/db mice following the 10-week treatment with CIM.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, while CIM effectively reduced ROS and improved renal mitochondrial respiration during a short-term treatment, it did not significantly impact oxidative stress markers over a long-term intervention, and unexpectedly worsened the glomerulo- sclerosis index despite reducing uACR.

**Association between polypharmacy and renal function decline in older adults with diabetes kidney disease: a cross-sectional study in Vietnam**

T.X. Nguyen

1. National Geriatric Hospital, Hanoi, Viet Nam, Hanoi Medical Uni-

**Background and aims:**
Polypharmacy, characterized by the con- current use of multiple medications, is increasingly recognized as a critical concern in older adults with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Age-related physiological changes, combined with the progression of diabetes, may amplify its detrimental effects on renal function. The cumulative medication burden in this population heightens the risk of nephrotoxicity, drug-drug interactions, and adverse clinical out- comes, which may accelerate renal function decline. This study aims to examine the association between polypharmacy and renal function decline in older adults with DKD to provide evidence for optimizing pharmacological management and mitigating renal function decline in this vulnerable population.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 962 outpatients aged 60 years and older were screened at a leading geriatric hospital in Vietnam. Inclusion criteria included individuals diagnosed with diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 90 mL/ min/1.73 m². Renal function was assessed based on eGFR and catego- rized according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 103 eligible participants. Demographic, clinical, and pharmacologi- cal data were systematically collected through standardized medical record reviews. Polypharmacy was defined as the use of five or more medications. Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models with eGFR as the dependent variable were used to investigate the relation- ship between polypharmacy and renal function decline. Model 1 was an unadjusted regression analysis examining the association between polypharmacy and eGFR. Subsequent models adjusted for age, gen- der, and lifestyle factors (Model 2); diabetes characteristics (Model 3); pharmacological treatments and chronic diseases (Model 4); and geri- atric syndromes, including comorbidities and sarcopenia (Model 5).

**Results:**
The mean age of the study population was 77.9 ± 7.9 years, with 50.5% of participants aged ≥80 years. The average duration of diabetes was 14.3 ± 7.7 years. The study population included 46.6% males and 53.4% females. Stage 3 renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/ min/1.73 m²) was the most common (53.4%), followed by Stage 2 (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m²; 41.7%). Multivariate regression analy- sis showed that polypharmacy was independently associated with lower eGFR (B = -10.7, 95% CI: -19.3 to -2.0, p = 0.02) after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors, diabetes characteristics, pharmaco- logical treatments, chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes.

**Conclusion:**
Polypharmacy is significantly associated with impaired renal function in older adults with DKD. These findings underscore the urgent need for polypharmacy prevention strategies to aid healthcare providers and policymakers in reducing renal function decline among older adults with diabetes.

1. Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Nether-
2. lands, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.

**Background and aims:**
Cells of renin lineage (CoRL) are an intrinsic regenerative cell population, capable of repopulating essential glo- merular cells post-injury, a process enhanced by inhibiting the sodium glucose co transporter 2 (SGLT2). Despite their potential, the under- lying cellular mechanisms remain largely elusive. Our study aims to identify the key genes driving this reparative process.

**Materials and methods:**
We employed a chronic kidney disease (CKD) model of 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6NX) in Ren1cre-tdTomato CoRL-lineage trace mice while daily administering the SGLT2 inhibi- tor empagliflozin (10mg/kg) for two weeks. Renal CoRL were isolated using fluorescent automated cell sorting (FACS) and subjected to single cell RNA sequencing.

**Results:**
SGLT2 inhibition improved kidney function post-injury, as reflected by lower blood urea levels and improved glomerular filtra- tion rate (GFR). This was accompanied by an increased presence of CoRL-derived intraglomerular cells, particularly podocytes. Single-cell sequencing confirmed a CoRL-derived podocyte cluster and revealed CoRL differentiation into multiple renal cell types, highlighting their multipotency. Notably, SGLT2 inhibition altered proximal tubule metabolism and reduced a profibrotic fibroblast population. Pseudotime analysis indicated a limited CoRL-to-podocyte transition but revealed a trajectory toward a fibroblast-like state, absent in baseline samples and emerging only after injury or treatment. This trajectory was marked by upregulation of inflammatory and extracellular matrix genes, while expression of genes linked to development and stemness declined, sug- gesting CoRL lose progenitor characteristics upon differentiation.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings underscore the dual regenerative and profibrotic roles of CoRL in kidney repair and the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on these processes. Ongoing investigations will refine our understanding of CoRL fate decisions, offering potential targets for enhancing renal regeneration.

**Effect of ursodeoxycholic acid as a reno-protective agent in peo- ple with type 1 diabetes and residual albuminuria despite renin angiotensin system inhibition**

P. Pavlou, Stathi, L. Gnudi, J. Karalliedde

**Background and aims:**
Ursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occur- ring bile acid secreted in human bile, currently used for the treatment of gallstones and liver disease associated with cholestasis. Labora- tory work on rodent experimental models of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) demonstrate that Ursodeoxycholic acid treatment reduces albuminuria and improves the histological changes of DKD. There are no human studies that have investigated the impact of Ursodeoxy- cholic acid treatment in DKD. The aim and objective in this proof of concept trial was to evaluate if Ursodeoxycholic acid reduces albumi- nuria in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) with residual albuminuria despite renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a single centre double blind pla- cebo controlled cross over trial to evaluate if Ursodeoxycholic acid added to established standard care including RAS inhibition reduces albuminuria. Primary endpoint was change in albumin excretion rate (uAER), after 24 weeks of treatment with Ursodeoxycholic acid as compared to 24 weeks on placebo.

**Results:**
Of the 31 people randomised 24 people (16 male) were eligible for analyses of the primary endpoint. Mean (range) age was 53.7 (23 - 75) years, and duration of diabetes 32.7 (12 - 60) years. Baseline median (interquartile range) eGFR was 70 (51 to 109) ml/ min/1.73m and uAER 28.5 (14.3 to 102) mcg/min respectively. Over 24 weeks uAER did not significantly fall with Ursodeoxycholic acid with between treatment group difference of mean log uAER least square means (95% confidence intervals) of -0.31 (-1.02, 0.41) p=0.38. During the study there were four serious adverse events (SAE) in three participants in the Ursodeoxycholic acid arm.

**Conclusion:**
In this first ever human study investigating the potential reno-protective effects of Ursodeoxycholic acid on top of standard of care in people with T1DM and DKD who had raised uAER, we did not observe a significant reduction in uAER. Further larger studies are required to clarify the long-term safety and potential benefits (if any) of Ursodeoxycholic acid in people with type 1 diabetes and kidney disease.

**Enhanced renal protective effects of Tirzepatide in type 2 dia- betes people**

S. Kaneko

**Background and aims:**
In Japan, 1/400 diabetes people undergo hemodialysis. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can lead to cardiovas- cular events (CVs). Therefore, early detection and protection against renal failure is paramount. Recent clinical trial research has revealed glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RAg) provides renal protection and decreases CVs in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) people. However, the effects of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), another incretin hormone, on renal function are unknown. This study analyzed whether Tirzepatide (Tir), GIP/GLP-1R dual agonist, has enhanced renal protection compared to GLP-1RAg therapy alone in real-world long duration applications.

**Materials and methods:**
Retrospective univariate and multivari- ate analyses regarding HbA1c, eGFR, body weight and age were performed on all three groups, A) eGFR >60, B) eGFR 59~30, and C) eGFR <30, of the T2D cases receiving Tir or GLP1RAg for 12 months or more from 04/2023. In addition, statistical analysis regard- ing eGFR took into account changes in body weight. Adverse events were monitored.

**Results:**
Of 367 T2D cases new to Tir (male 209, age 66.8±14.4, starting HbA1c 8.0±1.5%), 267 were analyzed (male 150, age 62±15, BMI 25.9±7.2, starting HbA1c 8.2±3.4%) and achieved HbA1c 6.7±2.4 % (P<0.01) over more than 1 years. In group B (70 cases/ male 50, HbA1c 7.9 ± 1.5%, eGFR 42.2 ± 7.4), 43 improved signifi- cantly (eGFR 50 ± 8.7 was 50.1 ± 11.4 (P < 0.01)), 3 were unchanged and 24 worsened (eGFR 50 ± 8.7 was 5.1 ± 11.4 (P < 0.01)). When weight changes are taken into account, Tir eGFR provided significant favorable changes compared to semaglutide injections (Sema), GLP- 1RAg alone (P<0.01). Group A (187 cases/male 92, HbA1c 8.1±1.6%, eGFR 85.5±18.1) and C (16 cases/male 11, HbA1c 8.7±1.3%, eGFR 20.9±6.6) had no significant changes. Side effects included excessive weight loss, appetite loss or nausea/vomiting and were cited as rea- sons for discontinuation, occurring at a similar rate for both medi- cines. Regarding Group B, Body weight changes for both Tir and Sema treated people showed no significant difference. Therefore, changes in body weight were factored out of the analysis. More cases of slower deterioration of eGFR or improvement in eGFR were observed in Tir treated people, compared to that of the Sema treated people. This sug- gests additional positive effects of GIP on GLP1RAg on renal protec- tion which may possibly result in an end-stage renal disease population decrease. Tir therapy may also lead to comparable reductions in CVs.

**Conclusion:**
This study suggests GIP/GLP-1R dual agonist signaling, Tir, enhances reno-protective effects and prevents renal impairment more than that of GLP1RAg alone without serious side effects. Overall positive effects of Tir could result in greater general well-being and immense medical cost savings. Longer observations in larger numbers are needed.

**Background and aims:**
SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are known to effectively reduce albuminuria. However, their effect on non-albumi- nuric proteinuria (NAP), an independent risk factor for progressive renal dysfunction and adverse outcomes, has not been well-studied. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of SGLT2i on NAP in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and explore the relationship between changes in NAP and urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (uNAG), a marker of tubu- lar injury. Additionally, considering that NAP levels primarily indicate tubular rather than glomerular pathology, we assessed whether NAP levels influence the albuminuria-lowering effect of SGLT2i.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective, single-arm pre-post com- parison study recruited 1,538 individuals with T2D who were pre- scribed SGLT2i. We included participants with baseline and follow- up single-spot urine measurements for the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR). The urinary non-albumin protein-to-creatinine ratio (NAPCR) was calculated by subtracting ACR from PCR. Participants were classified into four groups according to ACR (< or ≥30 mg/g) and NAPCR (< or ≥120 mg/g). The primary outcome was the change in NAPCR following SGLT2i treatment. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with changes in NAPCR and to determine whether the albuminuria-reducing effect of SGLT2i differed based on baseline NAPCR levels.

**Results:**
The median duration was 19.5 months (IQR 9.47, 38.7). The geometric mean of NAPCR increased by 8.5% from baseline (126.57 to 137.32 mg/gCr, p=0.002). However, among individuals with high NAPCR (≥120 mg/g), the overall mean NAPCR declined, including a 13.38% decrease in the high ACR subgroup (≥30 mg/g) (276.96 to 239.90 mg/gCr; p<0.001) and a non-significant 6.37% decrease in the low ACR subgroup (150.20 to 140.64 mg/gCr; p=0.221). Nota- bly, in the latter subgroup, patients with preserved renal function (eGFR ≥90) experienced a significant NAPCR reduction of 18.95% (p=0.01). Changes in NAPCR positively correlated with changes in uNAG (r=0.18, p<0.05). Additionally, multivariate regression analysis revealed that higher baseline NAPCR levels (log-transformed) were significantly associated with greater reductions in ACR (β=-73.29, p=0.009).

**Conclusion:**
SGLT2i has both albuminuria and NAP lowering effects in albuminuric and proteinuric T2D patients. In albuminuric T2D patients, higher baseline NAPCR levels predict greater albuminuria- lowering effects of SGLT2i, independently of eGFR or ACR levels. In non-albuminuric subjects, those with high NAPCR and preserved renal function experienced significant NAPCR reductions, potentially through protective effects against diabetic tubulopathy.

**Strategic management of blood pressure and serum albumin levels in older adults with diabetes-related chronic kidney disease**

M. Yamazaki

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes-related chronic kidney disease (DCKD) is a critical complication affecting prognosis of both older adults (OAs) and non-older adults (NAs) with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, its characteristics in OAs remains insufficiently explored. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of DCKD in OAs compared to NAs and to develop a strategic approach for its management.

**Materials and methods:**
This single-center prospective observational study enrolled individuals with T2D aged ≥20 years who had been followed at our hospital for at least one year between August 2012 and June 2016. Clinical data were updated annually. Treatment targets were achieve HbA1c <7.0% (<7.5% for those aged ≥75 years), blood pressure (BP) <130/80 mm Hg (<140/85 mm Hg for those aged 65-74 years, and <150/90 mm Hg for those aged ≥75 years or with a history of cerebral infarction), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C) <120 mg/dL (<100 mg/dL for those with a history of coronary vas- cular disease). Early cancer detection efforts were also implemented. Renal function-related parameters were compared between OAs (≥65 years) and NAs (<65 years). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope over five years was calculated, and multiple linear regres- sion analysis (MLRA) was conducted to identify baseline factors asso- ciated with changes in eGFR (ΔeGFR) from baseline to the end of the observation period.

**Results:**
Among 267 participants, 251 were included in the final analy- sis after excluding those who dropped out or had CKD stage G5. The maximum usage rates of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists were 76.5%, 16.2%, and 7.6%, respectively. At baseline, the mean values for OAs (n = 135) were: age, 73.3 years; body mass index (BMI), 24.4 kg/ m²; HbA1c, 7.0%; BP, 131.1/74.2 mmHg; LDL-C, 108.1 mg/dL; and serum albumin (sAlb), 4.2 g/dL. Corresponding values for NAs (n = 116) were: age, 55.1 years; BMI, 27.4 kg/m²; HbA1c, 7.2%; BP, 127.2/78.6 mmHg; LDL-C, 111.0 mg/dL; and sAlb 4.3 g/dL. No sig- nificant changes in HbA1c or systolic BP were observed over time. At baseline, urine albumin-to-clearance ratio (UACR) was comparable between OAs and NAs (206.0 vs. 194.3 mg/gCr, p = 0.26). However, at the end of the observation period, UACR was significantly higher in OAs than in NAs (340.6 vs. 148.0 mg/gCr, p = 0.01). The baseline eGFR was lower in OAs than in NAs (61.4 vs. 75.7 mL/min/1.73 ­m , p <0.001) and declined over time with a significant intergroup difference (54.8 vs. 63.2 mL/min/1.73 ­m at five year-time point, p = 0.006). The decline in eGFR slope was less pronounced in OAs than in NAs (-1.71 vs. -2.32 mL/min/1.73 ­m /year, p = 0.03). MLRA identified independ- ent baseline factors associated with ΔeGFR. In OAs, these included eGFR (β = -0.371), sAlb (β = 13.9), and systolic BP (β = -0.239). In NAs, eGFR (β = -0.307), LDL-C (β = -0.144), hemoglobin (Hb) (β = 2.143), and UACR ≥300 mg/gCr (β = -8.02) were significant factors.

**Conclusion:**
OAs exhibited a smaller decline in eGFR slope compared to NAs. This decline was associated with baseline factors, including higher systolic BP and lower sAlb levels, whereas Hb, LDL-C, or macroalbuminuria were not significant contributors. In addition to evidence-based pharmacological interventions for DCKD, managing elevated BP and low sAlb levels may be crucial for renal protection in OAs with T2D.

**Can we de-escalate pharmaco-therapies for certain patients living with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease?**

**Background and aims:**
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) develops in 30-40% of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) with a progres- sion that is potentially intensifying beyond simple addition. The pre- sent study explores therapeutic interventions where superior outcomes have been achieved using alternatives to a simple combination of each pathology’s guideline recommendations.

**Materials and methods:**
A neural network was first created to repro- duce UK national clinical guidelines for T2D and CKD management with an 89% accuracy. Relying on real-world evidence (RWE) of UK primary care, a transfer learning methodology was then applied on 18644 therapeutic decision timepoints, learning from clinical out- comes how to better achieve dual T2D & CKD optimisation targets here defined as min 7% relative HbA1c reduction for values >48 mmol/mol and either a non-decreasing eGFR for 30<eGFR<90 ml/min/1.73 m2 or a 30% relative uACR reduction for uACR> 30 mg/g, all within one year.Shapley values are used on 22486 treat- ment decision timepoints to define similar digital twin cohorts in an independent test set for whom alternative therapies to the guidelines show both statistically significant better outcomes and counterfactual evidence of the contrary (p-values < 0.01).

**Results:**
Therapies tested for an adult patient population (n=22486, mean+SD age 75+17.1 yr; M 56% vs F 44%; HbA1c 8.4+4%, eGFR 77+ 26.3 ml/min/1.73 m2, uACR 30+61.7 mg/mmol) included 16839 with T2D and independently 10144 with CKD. Two types of machine learning recommended therapeutic deviations from guide- lines resulted in average 14% or 17% improvement in probability of dual outcome success for a total of 357 or 208 therapies decreasing the overall pharmacological burden: combining an ACEi/ARB with an SGLT-2i (ΔHbA1c -0.3%, ΔeGFR +0.45 ml/min/1.73 m2) rather than with metformin-based dual therapy (ΔHbA1c -0.1%, ΔeGFR -1.63 ml/min/1.73 m2), and de-escalating from an ACEi/ARB com- bined with a metformin-based triple therapy or insulin regimen (ΔHbA1c -0.4%, ΔeGFR -1.74 ml/min/1.73 m2) to a dual therapy with two oral antidiabetic drugs (ΔHbA1c -0.4%, ΔeGFR +0.61 ml/ min/1.73 m2). An additional group of deviations from guidelines provide fertile ground for discussions with experienced clinicians.

**Conclusion:**
Observations from RWE outcomes question both a rather siloed interpretation of comorbidity under guidelines and a joint expected outcome of therapies that is not always additive, some- times even amounting to a de-escalation to improve the outcome. The results represent practical steps towards personalised precision medicine for cardiovascular comorbidity in routine clinical practice and require further testing in prospective studies.

**Background and aims:**
Most patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) do not present with albuminuria, and this nonalbuminuric phenotype is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the clinical impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in this population remains unclear. We aimed to compare the risk of dialysis, cardiovascular events, and mortality between users and nonusers of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalbuminuric CKD.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a population-based cohort study using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalbuminuric CKD were identi- fied between 1 May 2016 and 31 December 2021. Exposure was defined as the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, with nonuse serving as the comparator. The primary outcomes were initiation of dialysis, major adverse cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. Cox propor- tional hazards models were applied to evaluate the risk differences between the SGLT2 inhibitor group and the control group.

**Results:**
The study follow-up time was 3 years. The pre-matched intention-to-treat model showed that sodium-glucose cotrans- porter-2 inhibitors were associated with a lower risk of dialysis [aHR (95% CI) 0.21(0.10-0.44)], progression to macroalbuminu- ria [0.86(0.79-0.94)], anemia admission [0.83(0.68-1.02)], major adverse cardiovascular events [0.85(0.76-0.95)], acute kidney injury [0.68(0.56-0.82)], and all-cause mortality [0.63(0.52-0.76)] compared with no sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors use. Consistent results were shown in both as-treated and time-varying models. After propensity score matching, multivariable analyses showed that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors use was associated with a lower risk of dialysis [0.45 (0.12-1.70)], progres- sion to macroalbuminuria [0.84 (0.73-0. 97)], anemia admission [0.74 (0.54-1.03)], major adverse cardiovascular events [0.91 (0.77- 1.09)], acute kidney injury [0.84 (0.62-1.14)] and all-cause mor- tality [0.40 (0.28-0.59)] compared with not using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.

**Conclusion:**
This nationwide cohort study showed that sodium-glu- cose cotransporter-2 inhibitors use was associated with a lower risk of dialysis, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality compared to non-use in patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalbuminuric chronic kidney disease.

**Background and aims:**
Only a few studies reported the prevalence and course of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). CKD develops slowly with few symptoms, is a com- mon complication of T2D, and is easy to identify. CKD is a common cause of death, and therefore, it is important to be treated on time. Understanding the development of CKD in diabetes is paramount for planning diabetes care. This study investigated the prevalence of CKD 1 year after the diagnosis of T2D and in 5 years between 2012-2018.

**Materials and methods:**
The DIAbetes, MANagement and Treat- ment (DIAMANT) cohort was used. The DIAMANT cohort enables access to information of about 350,000 people with T2D. In people diagnosed with T2D, and with a measure of glomerulus filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) at the time of diag- nosis of T2D , their estimated glomerulus filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) was determined after 1 year and also determined after 5-year to track the development of the kidney function. Kidney function was divided into four categories according to KDIGO 2012 criteria, from normal to kidney failure. The eGFR, uACR, and KDIGO categories were calculated using absolute num- bers and percentages.

**Results:**
For 206,746 people with T2D the eGFR was known 1 year after T2D diagnosis and for 126,404 people 5 years after T2D diag- nosis. The eGFR was in 9% of the participants between 45-59 mmol mL/min/1.73m , 1.6% between 30-44 and 0.3% < 30 1-year after T2D diagnosis, and 5 years respectively 13.4%, 2.8%, and 0.5%. The uACR was 1.2% > 30 mg/mmol 1 year after the diagnosis of T2D and 1.6% after 5 years. The number of people in the two highest KDIGO categories doubled from 3.5% to 7% (Table).

**Conclusion:**
This study showed that 5 years after the diagnosis of T2D, 3.5% of the people with T2D had an eGFR below 45 and that the number of people at high risk of adverse events according to the KDIGO criteria increased from 3.5 to 7%.

2. sity, Tokyo, Japan, Internal Medicine, JCHO Saitama Medical Center,
3. Saitama, Japan, Asahi Kasei Corporation, Tokyo, Japan.

**Background and aims:**
The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has led to a rise in diabetic nephropathy cases, now a leading cause of dialysis initiation. Predicting future renal function decline is therefore of significant clinical importance. This study aimed to determine whether machine learning techniques could predict renal outcomes based on patterns of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) fluctuations over a one-year period in T2DM patients.

**Materials and methods:**
We included T2DM outpatients from our institution since January 2012 with an average eGFR of ≥45 mL/ min/1.73 m² during the prediction period. The input period consisted of data from one year prior to any given point, and the evaluation period spanned the subsequent three years. The primary endpoint was a ≥30% reduction in eGFR from the mean value during the input period. Data sets were extracted semi-annually, starting from the first laboratory test month, shifting backward, and terminated upon reaching the primary endpoint. Features included eGFR and urinary protein variability, along with age, sex, body weight, blood pressure, glycemic control indices, lipid metabolism markers, and medications such as SGLT2 inhibitors.

**Results:**
Among 21,872 eligible data sets, 7,216 had sufficient features for analysis, with 125 reaching the primary endpoint. The mean eGFR during the input period was 71.1 mL/min/1.73 m², mean age was 64.8 years, and 61.2% were female. Using demographic information and average values of each test item as features, the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting the primary endpoint during the evaluation period was 0.77. Incorporating variability components and prescription infor- mation—such as exponentially smoothed mean of proteinuria, maxi- mum-minimum HbA1c, intercept of proteinuria, standard deviation (SD) of creatinine, SD of eGFR, maximum HbA1c, SD of hemoglobin, SD of uric acid, linear regression coefficient of LDL-c, maximum- minimum HDL-c, linear regression coefficient of eGFR, maximum- minimum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), duration of medications other than SGLT2 inhibitors/GLP-1 receptor agonists, minimum hematocrit, and maximum BUN—the predictive model’s AUC improved to 0.82.

**Conclusion:**
This study successfully developed a machine learning- based model to predict renal function decline using one-year data from patients with relatively preserved renal function. The model effectively identified patients who may benefit from immediate therapeutic inten- sification. Previous studies analyzing data before the introduction of SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated that considering variability in proteinu- ria and eGFR over the past year enhances prognostic accuracy. In this study, including prescription information alongside time-series data further improved the prediction accuracy of renal outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
A Body Shape Index (ABSI) is a metric that takes into account height, weight, and waist circumference to assess the distribution of abdominal fat and the degree of obesity in the body. Though obesity and CKD have been long connected, unknown is the linkage between ABSI and CKD. In this study we examined the direct connection of ABSI and occurrence of CKD.

**Materials and methods:**
In this cross-sectional study 25,775 individu- als at the age ≥40 enrolled from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2001-2020) were selected who were reported having chronic kidney disease (CKD). A weighted multivari- ate logistic regression evaluated the association of ABSI levels with the occurrence of CKD. The dose-response association was plotted through restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, subgroup analyses was performed to substantiate the consistency between the association with different groups of demography and clinical conditions, and the mediator analysis provided clues for the primary factors explaining the primary association.

**Results:**
In confounder-adjusted models, ABSI continuously positive associated with CKD [OR (95% CI): 1.083(1.082, 1.084), < 0.001]. When we regard ABSI by quartiles, higher ABSI quartiles positively associated with CKD risk (Q3 [1.074 (1.072, 1.073), <0.001], and Q4 [1.107 (1.105, 1.108), <0.001]. According to RCS analysis, we could find a wave-shaped association between ABSI and CKD risk in some range. Subgroup analysis shows that ABSI showed consistently predictive capability across populations. Mediation analysis found that Weight - adjusted Waist Index (WWI) as an important mediator for this association accounting for the 41.18%of the total effect.

**Conclusion:**
ABSI are independently related to incident CKD, medi- ated by WWI. These data strongly encourage us to pay attention to the path of WWI mediated ABSI on CKD risk, and develop personalized health and clinical management to benefit most CKD prevention and management across WWI.

2. Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea, Department of Clinical Research

**Background and aims:**
Individuals on hemodialysis are at increased risk of mortality. However, whether the mortality differs by insulin use and type of diabetes remains unclear in this population. This study aimed to investigate the association between insulin use, type of dia- betes, and mortality among individuals on hemodialysis.

**Materials and methods:**
From the Korean Nationwide Cohort (2006- 2022), patients who commenced hemodialysis between 2011 and 2019 were followed up until 2022. The risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality was compared among hemodialysis patients without diabetes, those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) not receiving insulin therapy, those with T2D receiving insulin therapy, and those with type 1 diabetes (T1D) receiving insulin therapy, using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

**Results:**
A total of 52,809 patients on hemodialysis were followed up for a median of 4.6 years. The mean age of the participants was 64 years, and 61.3% were male. The all-cause mortality rate per 1,000 person-years was 51.2 in patients on hemodialysis without diabetes, 78.8 in those with T2D not receiving insulin therapy, 117.8 in those with T2D receiving insulin therapy, and 120.3 in those with T1D receiving insulin therapy. After adjusting for confounding variables, compared to patients on hemodialysis without diabetes, the risk of all-cause mortality was particularly higher for those with T2D receiv- ing insulin therapy (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.57) and T1D receiving insulin therapy (adjusted HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.49-1.91), while it was comparable in those with T2D not receiving insulin therapy (adjusted HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84- 1.07). Similar trends were observed in cardiovascular mortality.

**Conclusion:**
Mortality risk is elevated in patients on hemodialysis and is even higher in those receiving insulin therapy, both in T1D and T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Despite advances in managing hyperglycaemia, CKD prevalence in T1D remains high. This study aims to provide current estimates of CKD prevalence and characteristics in a large population of individuals with T1D in Salford, Manchester.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Salford Integrated Record Research Database (SIR-RD), which includes anonymised health records of T1D individuals from 2010 to 2023. CKD was defined as an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m² on two occasions over 90 days, with a uACR ≥3 mg/mmol. Competing risk analysis models assessed factors associated with CKD onset.

**Results:**
The study population (N = 1,131) had a mean age of 43.7 ± 17.8 years, with 58.5% male. Most participants identified as White (51.6%), followed by Mixed Race (32.0%), with 9.81% unknown eth- nicity. Nearly half (49.5%) lived in the most deprived IMD quintile. Smoking status was largely unknown (35.8%), with 33.6% ex-smok- ers and 30.6% current smokers. The mean HbA1c was 70.4 ± 16.3 mmol/mol, and 50.1% were prescribed ACE inhibitors/ARBs. CKD prevalence was 12.6%. Over an average follow-up of 8.3 years, 241 individuals (21.3%) died. In competing risk regression, older age was significantly linked to CKD onset (SHR: 1.0, p < 0.001), while sex and ethnicity had no significant associations. Socioeconomic deprivation showed some impact, with IMD Quintile 4 having a higher risk than Quintile 1 (SHR: 1.7, p = 0.04). Smoking status had no impact, but HbA1c had a small significant effect (SHR: 1.0, p = 0.005). For CKD defined by albuminuria alone, older age remained a significant risk fac- tor (SHR: 1.0, p < 0.001). Asians had a significantly lower risk (SHR: 6.4, p < 0.001), while Black and Unknown ethnic groups showed non- significant trends towards increased risk. Socioeconomic deprivation and smoking status were not linked to CKD onset, but the all-period measure was associated with increased risk (SHR: 1.0, p < 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Older age significantly increases the risk of CKD onset, while Asian ethnicity was associated with a markedly lower risk. Soci- oeconomic deprivation and smoking status did not significantly impact CKD onset. Glycaemic control (HbA1c) contributed to risk. These findings underscore the importance of age and glycaemic control in predicting CKD onset, with ethnicity suggesting potential population- specific risks for further exploration.

2. China, Department of Endocrinology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast

**Background and aims:**
Regenerating protein Iα (REG Iα) is a small molecular weight (16 kDa) secretory protein primarily synthesized by pancreatic acinar cells. Elevated serum levels of REG Iα have been observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with renal dys- function and are closely associated with renal function parameters. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of serum REG Iα for early renal function decline in patients with T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
A prospective cohort study was conducted at an academic medical center between January 2022 and February 2024, enrolling 404 patients with T2DM who were free of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Quarterly assessments included blood glucose, and renal function markers. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression was employed to analyze the nonlinear relationship between baseline serum REG Iα levels and early renal function decline, which defined as an annual eGFR decline rate > 3.3% in patients with UACR ≤ 30 mg/g. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association between serum REG Iα and renal function decline risk, with further validation via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

**Results:**
In the study, 91 patients (22.52%) developed early renal function decline, with a secondary hospitalization rate of 16.58%. The median follow-up duration was 18 [12-30] months. RCS analy- sis revealed a nonlinear association between baseline serum REG Iα levels and renal function decline (nonlinear = 0.021), with an cutoff value at 27.52 ng/mL. When the baseline serum level of REG Iα was ≤ 27.52 ng/mL, its correlation with renal decline risk was minimal. Conversely, when the baseline serum level of REG Iα was > 27.52 ng/ mL, an increased risk of early renal function decline was observed as its level rises. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that elevated baseline serum REG Iα levels (>27.52 ng/mL) independently predicted early renal function decline (HR = 2.410 [1.144-5.076], = 0.031), after adjusting for confounding factors. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that T2DM patients with high baseline serum REG Iα levels (>27.52 ng/mL) had a significantly higher risk of early renal function decline compared to those with low baseline levels (≤27.52 ng/mL, Log-rank = 11.20, < 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates that elevated serum REG Iα levels are significantly associated with early renal function decline in patients with T2DM, suggesting its potential clinical value as a novel predictive biomarker.

2. China, Faculty of Medicine, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming

**Background and aims:**
It is well documented that intensive glucose control reduces the risk of multiple complications in patients with diabetes compared to moderate glucose control. However, most of these trials have either excluded patients over 80 years of age or included too few to establish a clear benefit-to-risk ratio in the elderly. Due to the lack of clinical trial data evaluating the effects of long-term inten- sive glucose control in older patients, the benefits of such an approach remain uncertain for this heterogeneous population. This study aimed to provide robust evidence on the benefits and risks associated with glucose control in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Patients with type 2 diabetes who were older than 80 years and able to walk independently were recruited into this prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled study. The goal in the intensive therapy group was to maintain glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) below 7%, compared to the conservative therapy group, which aimed to maintain HbA1c below 9%. The primary study outcomes included macrovascular and microvascular events. Macrovascular events were defined as a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfa- tal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Microvascular events included new or worsening nephropathy or new-onset retinopathy. Secondary outcomes included death from any cause, hospitalization for hypoglycemia, and any hospitalization lasting more than 24 hours. Patients were followed for the study endpoints for 5 years after rand- omization or until death, whichever came first. Additionally, all patients were followed until 2023 for survival. Events between the two groups were analyzed using Cox’s proportional hazards model.

**Results:**
A total of 206 patients underwent randomization. At the end of the follow-up period, the mean HbA1c was 7.4% in the intensive control group and 8.2% in the standard control group. A total of 7 patients (6.9%) in the intensive control group and 7 patients (6.7%) in the conservative control group experienced macrovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-2.92; = .97). Microvascular events occurred in 34 patients (33.3%) in the inten- sive control group and 29 patients (26%) in the conservative control group (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.76-2.04; = .39). No significant differ- ences between the two groups were observed. The median survival after long-term follow-up was 6.75 years. The median survival was 7.01 years in the intensive therapy group and 6.46 years in the con- servative therapy group, respectively ( = 0.169). There were more frequent hypoglycemia hospitalization events in the intensive control group (HR, 7.31; 95% CI, 1.17-8.77; =.03).

**Conclusion:**
Patient with type 2 diabetes older than 80 years and in relatively stable health showed no difference in macrovascular events, microvascular events, or survival benefits between the intensive glyce- mic control group and the conservative glycemic control group. How- ever, the intensive glycemic control group had a higher incidence of hypoglycemia requiring hospitalization.

**A correlation study between different urinary albumin-to-creati- nine ratio (UACR) levels and pancreatic cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes**

H. Guo

**Background and aims:**
To investigate the correlation between differ- ent urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) levels and pancreatic α and β cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 458 T2DM patients admitted to the hospital from March 2018 to December 2024 were included in the study. These patients were divided into three groups based on their UACR levels: normal albuminuria group (UACR < 30 mg/g), micro- albuminuria group (30 mg/g ≤ UACR ≤ 300 mg/g), and macroalbu- minuria group (UACR > 300 mg/g). All patients underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and had their blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon levels measured at fasting and 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after consuming 75 g of glucose. The homeostasis model assessment for β-cell function (HOMA-β), homeostasis model assess- ment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin area under the curve (AUC​ ), glucagon area under the curve (AUC​ ), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), early insulin secretion index (ΔI30/ΔG30), and disposition index (DI) were calculated.

**Results:**
Compared with the normal albuminuria group, the microalbu- minuria and macroalbuminuria groups showed significantly increased glucagon levels, AUC​ , and glucagon-to-insulin ratio at each time point (P < 0.05). Compared with the normal albuminuria group, the microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria groups had significantly higher HOMA-IR and lower insulin sensitivity index (ISI) (P < 0.05). Compared with the normal albuminuria and microalbuminuria groups, the macroalbuminuria group had higher AUC​ and lower DI (P < 0.05). (3) Glucagon was negatively correlated with eGFR, BMI, and ISI, and positively correlated with FPG, AUC​ , ­HbA , UACR, and dis- ease duration. UACR was positively correlated with disease duration, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucagon-to-insulin ratio, HOMA-IR, and AUC​ , and negatively correlated with ISI. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed that UACR was positively correlated with disease duration, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucagon-to-insulin ratio, and HOMA-IR.

**Conclusion:**
Patients with T2DM complicated by diabetic kidney dis- ease displayed compromised pancreatic α- and β-cell function. Further- more, a correlation was observed between glucagon levels and urinary albumin, suggesting a potential interplay in the onset and progression of diabetic kidney disease.

**Association of Cesarean section delivery and increased neonatal cord C-peptide levels: evidence from a large population-based pregnancy outcome study**

G. Firneisz

**Background and aims:**
Cord C-peptide (CP) levels are of great impor- tance in predicting neonatal hypoglycemia. Furthermore, based on the Hyperglycemia Advanced Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study follow- up results higher neonatal cord C-peptide levels were associated with decreased insulin sensitivity later in childhood. We assessed maternal, neonatal and pregnancy factors that could influence the CP concentra- tion in venous cord blood in a large population study.

**Materials and methods:**
The analysis was conducted using data from HAPO population-based study. We could access the data of 1501 mother-child pairs of European origin (NIH dbGaP phs000096/T2DM- BIRTHWT) after our data access request was granted. Multivariate linear regression was used to model the cord CP value (on a logarithmic scale). A basic model using routine clinical parameters (maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, plasma glucose (PG) levels at OGTT, number of prior pregnancies, gestational age at delivery, Cesarean section delivery (C-sec), neonatal sex and birthweight) and an extended model with all available variables were created. Continuous variables were standard- ized. Backward variable selection was performed on the variables of the extended model using the Akaike information criterion. From the analysis we excluded those mother-neonate pairs where any of the vari- ables were missing. After obtaining the best model, we expanded the patient group, thus excluding only those pairs where any of the model variables were missing (n=1419). In this group, we rebuilt the basic model to make the two models comparable. The AIC value of the basic model was 1792, while that of the extended model was 1774.

**Results:**
The base model results are indicated in Table. Variables included in the best model in addition to the base model were as follows: maternal CP level at OGTT (multiplicative effect=1.059, p=2x10 ), smoking status (NS), and the neonatal head circumference (multiplicative effect=0.957, p=4x10 ). The effect of C-sec (multi- plicative effect=1.159, p=1.05x10 ). remained significant in the best model as well.

**Conclusion:**
In addition to the maternal (CP, FPG and 2h PG at OGGT, 1st pregnancy) and neonatal factors (head circumference, birthweight, sex, gestational age at delivery) we identified cesarean section delivery as a novel factor associated with increased neonatal cord blood CP level. This novel association that - to our best knowledge have not yet been reported previously - might have further implications for the inde- pendently reported clinical associations of C-sec delivery with neonatal hypoglycemia and childhood obesity. This necessitates further studies on the clinical significance of this novel association.

**Background and aims:**
Identifying the association of maternal prepregnant overweight/obesity with offspring cardiovascular health (CVH) may provide an opportunity for early intervention to mitigate its accumulation and deterioration in later life. We aimed to study the association of maternal prepregnant overweight/obesity with off- spring’s CVH trajectory from ages 7 to 18 and assess mediation effects of maternal glycaemic status during pregnancy on the association.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 313 mother-child pairs from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Study at Hong Kong Centre were included. Women with chronic hypertension were excluded. Anthropometrics and clinical indices were collected during pregnancy and at 7, 11, and 18 years postpartum. Maternal prepregnant overweight/obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 24.0 kg/m . Maternal glucose levels were measured at OGTT during pregnancy. Offspring CVH score was assessed based on BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and glucose level with a range from 0 to 8, and a lower score indicates poorer CVH status. Linear mixed model (LMM) was used to assess separated effect of maternal prepregnant overweight/obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on pro- gression of offspring’s CVH score. Group-based trajectory model (GBTM) was used to determine CVH score trajectories. Logistic regression was used to examine associations of maternal prepreg- nant overweight/obesity and glycaemic status with offspring’s CVH trajectories. Model-based mediation analysis was used to evaluate mediation effect of maternal glycaemic status on the association of prepregnant overweight/obesity and offspring’s CVH trajectories.

**Results:**
LMM revealed that children of mothers with prepregnant overweight/obesity (β = -0.39, 95% CI -0.69- -0.09, P = 0.013) or GDM (β = -0.41, 95% CI -0.74- -0.09, P = 0.015) had lower CVH scores from ages 7 to 18. GBTM analysis identified two distinct trajectory groups for offspring CVH scores ages 7 to 18: (1) low and decreasing group (23.00%, adverse) and (2) high and increas- ing group (77.00%, reference). Compared to mothers with normal prepregnant BMI, children of mothers with prepregnant overweight/ obesity had a 2.42-fold higher risk of having the adverse CVH tra- jectory (95% CI 1.23-4.71, P = 0.009). A 1 unit increase in mater- nal sum of glucose z-score during pregnancy was associated with a 1.23-fold higher risk of offspring having the adverse CVH trajectory (95% CI 1.09-1.40, P = 0.001). Compared to mothers without GDM, children of mothers with GDM had a 2.35-fold higher risk of having an adverse CVH trajectory (95% CI 1.06-5.09, P = 0.032). Moreo- ver, maternal sum of glucose z-score during pregnancy mediated the effect of prepregnant overweight/obesity on the risk of offspring having the adverse CVH trajectory (proportion 0.18, 95% CI 0.03- 0.68, P = 0.010).

**Conclusion:**
Offspring of mothers who were prepregnant overweight/ obesity and exposed to adverse in-utero glycaemic status had a higher risk of adverse CVH trajectory from childhood to early adulthood. The maternal sum of glucose z-score during pregnancy mediated the effects of maternal prepregnant overweight/obesity on the adverse offspring CVH trajectory. In addition to optimizing maternal prepregnant BMI, managing glucose during pregnancy is also important to the offspring’s CVH in later life.

**Background and aims:**
Optimising glycaemic control in pregnancies affected by type 1 diabetes (T1D) is essential to improve outcomes. While hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin pumps and continuous glu- cose monitoring (CGM) have improved glycaemic outcomes in non- pregnant populations, their role in pregnancy is less well defined. This observational study evaluates the impact of three management strate- gies—multiple daily injections (MDI) with home blood glucose moni- toring (HBGM), MDI with CGM, and HCL systems—on glycaemic control and pregnancy outcomes in a combined diabetes-obstetric clinic at a university teaching hospital.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective analysis was conducted on glycaemic and pregnancy outcome data in women with T1D. Par- ticipants were categorised into three groups based on their diabetes management: • Group 1 - MDI with HBGM using 7-point profiles • Group 2 - MDI with CGM • Group 3 - HCL systems Glycaemic control was assessed using HbA1c and CGM-derived metrics—Time in Range (TIR), Time Above Range (TAR), and Time Below Range (TBR)—recorded at the end of each trimester. All CGM and HCL systems were initiated prior to conception. TIR was defined as the percentage of time glucose levels were within the target range of 3.5-7.0 mmol/L for 2023, which was extended to 3.5-7.8 mmol/L in 2024 as per the International Consensus on Time in Range recommendations for pregnancy.

**Results:**
A total of 51 pregnancies were included: Group 1 (n=13), Group 2 (n=22), and Group 3 (n=16; Medtronic 780G, n=11; Tandem t:slim X2, n=5). At 12 weeks, HbA1c levels were signifi- cantly higher in Group 1 compared to Groups 2 and 3. This trend persisted throughout pregnancy, with Group 1 showing significantly higher HbA1c at end of each trimester (Table 1). No significant dif- ferences in HbA1c were observed between Groups 2 and 3. Simi- larly, CGM-derived metrics—TIR, TAR, and TBR—did not differ significantly between Groups 2 and Group 3 throughout pregnancy (Table 1). There were no significant differences between groups in rates of macrosomia, large-for-gestational-age infants, neonatal hypoglycaemia, NICU admissions, or caesarean section. However, preterm delivery rates (<37 weeks) were significantly higher in Group 1 (53.9%) compared to Group 2 (22.7%, p < 0.05) and Group 3 (25%, p < 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Use of CGM—whether with MDI or as part of an HCL system—was associated with improved HbA1c and lower rates of preterm delivery compared to MDI with HBGM. Glycaemic out- comes were similar between the CGM and HCL groups. These find- ings highlight the value of diabetes technology in optimising man- agement of T1D throughout pregnancy.

**Background and aims:**
Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes are recommended to deliver in hospital and many require admission dur- ing pregnancy for maternal diabetes and pregnancy-related complica- tions. Hospital admissions come with additional stresses and changes to daily routines and dietary intake which further complicate diabetes self-management. Transferring insulin dosing into the hands of less experienced hospital or obstetric ward staff can be perceived as “dis- empowering, frightening and stressful”. This secondary analysis aims to evaluate the use and safety of the CamAPS FX hybrid closed-loop system (HCL) during hospital admissions for labour and delivery.

**Materials and methods:**
AiDAPT was a multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial where 124 pregnant women with type 1 dia- betes from nine UK sites were assigned to hybrid closed-loop therapy or standard insulin therapy with CGM. Women continued use of their assigned treatment through labour and delivery (including planned caesarean section) into the postpartum period. In this pre-specified, secondary observational analysis, the time periods where women were admitted to hospital including for labour, birth and the immediate inpa- tient postpartum periods were isolated and glycaemic outcomes were compared between the two groups.

**Results:**
Out of 124 randomised participants, 111 women had CGM data from their admission to deliver their baby. 55 women in the HCL group and 54 women in the standard care group were included in the labour and delivery period (including planned caesarean sections) with 53 and 54 women respectively included in the inpatient postpartum period. During labour and delivery, HCL users spent 72 ± 26% time between 3.5-7.8mmol/L vs. 66 ± 24% in standard care. Adjusted treat- ment difference for this time period was 7% (95% CI -3%, 16%). Dur- ing the inpatient postpartum period, HCL users spent 77 ± 19% time between 3.9-10.0mmol/L whilst standard users spent 70 ± 17%, with an adjusted treatment difference of again 7% (95% CI 0%, 15%). Rates of hypoglycaemia were low during both these periods in both groups: 0% time <3.5mmol/L during labour and delivery in both HCL and standard care and 3.0% time <3.9mmol/L for HCL vs. 2.4% for standard care in the immediate inpatient postpartum period.

**Conclusion:**
CamAPS FX hybrid closed-loop users spent more time in the target glucose ranges compared to standard care during labour and delivery (3.5-7.8mmol/L) and the immediate inpatient postpartum period (3.9-10.0mmol/L). Pregnant women can safely continue using hybrid closed-loop therapy during intrapartum hospital admissions.

**Background and aims:**
Over recent decades, Caesarean section rates have surged globally, with emergency lower segment caeserean section(emLSCS) carrying greater risks than elective lower segment caeserean section (elLSCS). Within the United Kingdom’s National Healthcare Service system, significant variations persist in delivery outcomes, particularly for first-time mothers. This study examines how ethnicity, metabolic health, and social determinants influence delivery modes, aiming to identify actionable disparities in maternity care.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 8,212 singleton deliveries (January 2023-January 2024) from a UK hospital network. Primiparous women (n=4,250) were screened for gestational diabetes using standard glucose thresholds. Sociode- mographic data, including ethnicity and deprivation indices, were collected. Multivariate regression models identified predictors of deliv- ery mode while adjusting for clinical and social confounders.

**Results:**
Of 8212 deliveries, 4250 (51.8%) were first-born babies, of these, 1214 (28.6%) were born by emLSCS, 670 (15.8%) by elLSCS, 1584 (37.3%) by spontaneous delivery and 781 (18.4%) by assisted delivery. Among the mothers of the first-born babies with emLSCS, 37.0% were White, 16.1% Black African Caribbean, 18.9% Asian, 20.7% Mixed and 7.4% Other ethnicities. Of this cohort, 20.7% had a BMI> 30 kg/m and 10.5% were diagnosed with GDM. Women of Black African origin had 1.79 times higher rates of emLSCS com- pared to the women of white ethnic group (Exp(B) = 1.79, p = .01). Obesity (Exp(B) = 1.63, p = .02) and having diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 48mmol/L), rather than gestational diabetes were also associated with a significantly higher emLSCS rates (Exp(B) = 4.690, p = .01). Older age was associated with lower rates of spontaneous vaginal deliv- ery (Exp(B) = 0.93, p < .001). Women of Black ethnicity had lower elLSCS rates (Exp(B) = 0.43, p = .02). Older women and women of higher sociodemographic index had higher elLSCS rates (Exp(B) = 1.16, p < .001; Exp(B) = 1.09, p = .04).

**Conclusion:**
Our analysis, after adjusting for potential confounders, highlights significant associations between ethnicity, obesity and dia- betes with increased rates of emLSCS. Women of Black African Carib- bean ethnicity had 1.79 times higher emLSCS rates and significantly lower rates of elLSCS. These disparities could be partially driven by higher rates of comorbidities e.g. hypertension and diabetes and biases in healthcare access in certain ethnic groups. Emergency LSCS is generally performed on the basis of clinical need. Preconception diabetes and weight management and personalised delivery planning could potentially reduce emLSCS rates. Clinical practice and policy emphasise the need for personalised antenatal care for high-risk groups, especially Black women with obesity and HbA1c>48mmol/mol. Nota- bly, the observed ethnic disparities in em/elLSCS rates call for a deeper exploration of underlying causes, including biases in clinical decision- making and differential access to care to reduce disparities in emLSCS rates and unwarranted variations in clinical practice.

**Background and aims:**
Pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is still associated with higher risk of delivering large to ges- tational age (LGA) babies compared to general pregnant population. Thanks to the support of The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity (GOCC) program pregnant females with T1DM in Poland can initiate treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using insulin pumps enhanced by hypo-stop function (MiniMed 640G & 740G) with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) at the stage of pro- creation or early pregnancy at no cost. However, delivering LGA babies in this population still remains an issue. The aim of our study was to analyze what factors are related to LGA babies delivery in patients qualified for the GOCC program.

**Materials and methods:**
One hundred pregnant women with T1DM, mean age 27.8 ± 4.2 years (range 21-41), with mean T1DM duration 14.1 ± 7.9 years were included. Before pregnancy 33 women were treated with CSII (using own pumps), out of them 9 used additionally isCGM, 65 females were using insulin pens, 25 of them were using also isCGM, 2 were diagnosed with T1DM at early pregnancy. We analyzed associations of age, anthropometric parameters, diabetes duration, its metabolic control and insulin requirement with delivering LGA babies.

**Results:**
During CSII + rtCGM treatment metabolic control in the whole group significantly improved, mean HbA1c decreased from 7.12±1.04% before pregnancy to 6.10±0.77% in the third trimester, mean time in range (TIR) increased from 62.1±16.3% to 68.3±13.6% and mean time above range (TAR) decreased from 33.4±15.4% to 28.1±14.6%, P<0.001 in all cases. 28 women delivered LGA babies. Women who delivered LGA babies were younger, they had signifi- cantly higher baseline BMI, worse metabolic control measured by HbA1c, TIR and TAR and higher daily insulin dose increase during pregnancy (Table). In the multiple logistic regression analysis we revealed 4 independent predictors of delivering LGA babies: preges- tational BMI ≥23.1 kg/m , OR 24.79 (95% CI 3.60-170.72), P=0.001, insulin dose increase >0.37 IU/kg, OR 7,01 (1,86-26.49), P=0.002, TAR >26%, OR 15,11 (2.22-103.09), P=0.006 and age < 31 years, OR 4.49 (1.07-18.77), P=0.040. Cut-off points were determined based on ROC curve analysis and the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity for each variable.

**Conclusion:**
Women with T1DM are at increased risk of delivering LGA babies. In this context our study indicate that maintaining low BMI before conception is of utmost importance. During pregnancy, the aim should be to reduce TAR, but without excessive escalation of the daily insulin dose, which is particularly important in the group of younger patients, in our study <31 years of age. Therefore, education regarding proper diet and physical activity may be a key part of therapy.

**Background and aims:**
The CRISTAL trial showed that advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) therapy with the MiniMed™ 780G system in type 1 diabetes (T1D) pregnancy did not improve the pregnancy-spe- cific time in range (TIRp) overall compared to standard insulin therapy (SoC), but improved TIRp overnight and reduced time below range (TBRp). Identifying subgroups that may benefit most from AHCL use is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies. We aimed to identify subgroups that may benefit most from AHCL therapy in pregnancy based on baseline characteristics.

**Materials and methods:**
This is a secondary analysis of the CRISTAL study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing MiniMed™ 780G AHCL with SoC in 95 pregnant women with T1D. The primary out- come (TIRp) and key secondary outcomes (TIRp overnight, TBRp overall and overnight) were evaluated according to various baseline characteristics.

**Results:**
AHCL users with baseline HbA1c <7.0% (n=35) had a sig- nificantly higher TIRp than SoC (n=37), with a mean difference of 5.64% (95% CI: 1.32-9.96), corresponding to 1h21min more TIRp per day and 11.89% (95% CI: 7.01-16.76) higher TIRp overnight. In women without prior AHCL use, TIRp was 6.29% (95% CI: 0.90- 11.68) higher in the AHCL group (n=24) with also an 11.91% (95% CI: 5.65-18.16) higher overnight TIRp compared to SoC (n=28). TIRp was significantly higher in AHCL users (n=14) compared to SoC (n=14) in women without higher education (7.33%, 95% CI: 0.88-13.78). TBRp was significantly lower in AHCL users with baseline HbA1c <7.0% and in women without prior AHCL use compared to SoC.

**Conclusion:**
AHCL use with the MiniMed™ 780G system improved glycemic control in pregnant women with baseline HbA1c <7.0%, in women without prior AHCL use and in women without higher edu- cation, indicating that AHCL use might particularly benefit these subgroups.

**Background and aims:**
Large-for-gestational-age newborns (LGA) are the most common adverse outcome of pregnancy with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). LGA are associated with significant maternal and neonatal complications. LGA incidence remains high even in pregnancies with good glycaemic control. Therefore, several studies focused on glycaemic variability (GV) as a possible risk fac- tor for development of LGA but the results were contradictory. The aim of this study was to determine if the higher GV in pregnancy is associated with higher incidence of LGA and to identify which GV parameter is the most significant predictor of LGA outcome in patients with T1DM in pregnancy.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a prospective observational cohort study which included patients with T1DM in the first tri- mester of pregnancy who were using continuous glucose monitor- ing (CGM). Inclusion criteria included good glycaemic control and normal body mass index. Patients were evaluated at least once in every trimester. Several GV parameters were calculated from CGM data; percent coefficient of variation (%CV), standard deviation (SD), continuous overall net glycaemic action (CONGA), lability index (LI), mean absolute glucose (MAG), the mean of daily dif- ferences (MODD), low blood glucose index (LBGI), high blood glucose index (HBGI), average daily risk range (ADRR), M-value, and J-index. Association between GV parameters in pregnancy and LGA incidence was assesed using binary logistic regression analysis. ROC analysis and Youden statistics were used to define cut-off value of a most significant GV parameter associated with LGA outcome. P value < 0.05 was statistically significant.

**Results:**
In total, 88 patients completed the study (median age at conception 29.5 years, median HbA1c 6.5%). The LGA incidence was 35.2%. None of the GV parameters was positively associated with LGA outcome, but the most significant parameter negatively associated with LGA was LBGI in the first trimester of pregnancy (p=0.02, OR=0.79, 95%CI (0.64, 0.96). The first trimester LBGI values below 7.1 were defined as a significant risk for the LGA outcome (Figure 1) with sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 49%, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Higher GV in pregnancy is not associated with higher incidence of LGA. The LBGI parameter in the first tri- mester of pregnancy may help identify patients at significant risk for LGA outcome. These results showed that the lower glucose values in the first trimester of pregnancy are significantly associ- ated with lower LGA incidence. Accordingly, patients should be advised to keep glycaemia in the lower reference range, especially in the first trimester, to reduce the risk of LGA. These results suggest the need for potential changes of time-in-range recom- mendation in pregnancy with T1DM.

**Cardiovascular disease risk profile in women with type 1 diabetes under pre-conceptional care and obstetric and neonatal implica- tions (preliminary data)**

**Background and aims:**
In recent years, increasing attention has been given to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk of women with metabolic complications during pregnancy (the so-called "fourth trimester"). How- ever, there is limited data on the pre-conceptional risk profile, particu- larly in highly vulnerable subgroups such as women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Our objective was to assess the CVD risk of women with T1DM during pre-conceptional care and investigate its relationship with the risk of preeclampsia and other maternal-fetal complications.

**Materials and methods:**
A study was conducted on women with T1DM initiating pre-conceptional care at a tertiary-level hospital, undergoing a structured CVD risk assessment, including carotid ultra- sound evaluation. Baseline characteristics of the population and their progression until the end of pregnancy were described, along with the relationship between pre-conceptional carotid ultrasound parameters (intima-media thickness [IMT] and plaques in different vascular ter- ritories) and maternal-fetal complications.

**Results:**
A total of 49 patients were included (mean age 35.5±3.7 years, mean T1DM duration 20.4±9.3 years, mean 5-year HbA1c 7.1±0.8%). Severe or unrecognised hypoglycaemia was reported in 20.4%, micro- vascular complications in 32.7%, overweight/obesity in 40.8%, and active/past smoking in 40.8%. No patient had hypertension. Insulin multiple-dose therapy was used by 85.7% of patients. Regarding CVD risk factors treatment, 2% were on statins and 2% on ACE inhibitors/ ARBs. Carotid IMT > p75 was found in 59.2%, and carotid plaque in 6.1% (n=3). The 10-year CVD risk estimated by the Steno T1 Risk Engine was predominantly low (98%). Of the total patients, 29 con- ceived, with 8.2% at high risk of preeclampsia in the first trimester. Regarding maternal-fetal outcomes, 8.2% had preterm delivery, 65.1% underwent caesarean section, 26.1% of newborns were large for gesta- tional age, and 21.7% had neonatal hypoglycemia. No association was found between atherosclerotic variables and preeclampsia risk or uterine artery pulsatility index (p>0.5 for both). However, internal carotid IMT showed a significant inverse relationship with birth weight, even after adjusting for gestational age and third-trimester HbA1c (standardized beta=-0.466, p=0.029).

**Conclusion:**
Although CVD risk estimated using T1DM-specific scales in pre-conceptional care is generally low, a high percentage of patients present CVD risk factors, and more than half exhibit some degree of subclinical atherosclerosis. While the study sample is yet to be expanded, preliminary data suggest that pre-conceptional ultrasound assessment may help identify women at higher risk of maternal-fetal complications.

**Novel subtypes of gestational diabetes and their associations with maternal and fetal outcomes: a data-driven cluster analysis in two ethnically diverse birth cohorts**

M. Pigeyre, Souza, S. Anand

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a highly hetero- geneous condition, yet no classification has been established. Refined subtyping could help tailor glycemic control strategies and identify mothers and newborns at the highest risk of complications.

**Materials and methods:**
Data-driven cluster analysis was performed using k-means on 403 mothers with GDM from the South Asian Birth Cohort Study (START, n=302 with GDM/ 599 without GDM) and the Family Atherosclerosis Monitoring in Early Life (FAMILY, n=100/560). Clustering was based on five variables: maternal age at diagnosis, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), and blood glucose levels at three 75-g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) time points. Logistic regression models were used to assess differences in maternal and fetal complications across clusters. Additionally, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of cardiometabolic traits were derived to characterize subtypes, by examining unique and overlapping PRSs associations with each cluster.

**Results:**
Four distinct GDM clusters were identified, each of which differed by baseline characteristics and risks of maternal and fetal com- plications. Compared to mothers without GDM, cluster 1 (“most severe GDM”) was characterized by older maternal age and the highest hyper- glycemia, and cluster 2 (“obesity-related GDM”), had an increased risk of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) newborns (OR=2.57, 95%CI [1.36-4.84], 3.21 [1.80-5.72], in cluster 1 and cluster 2 respectively), and gestational hypertensive disorders [1.28 [1.11-1.47], 1.28 [1.12- 1.46], respectively). Clusters 2 and 3 (“post-prandial GDM”) also had higher risk of Caesarean section (2.78 [1.72-4.45], 1.80 [1.31-2.47], respectively). Cluster 4 (“fasting GDM”) was not linked to increased maternal or fetal complications. The clusters showed distinct nominal associations with PRSs of GDM, type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose and insulin, BMI, subcutaneous adiposity, and HDL cholesterol.

**Conclusion:**
Four distinct GDM subtypes with unique clinical and genetic presentations were identified. This novel classification may help personalize treatment strategies, marking a step toward precision medicine in GDM.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is asso- ciated with adverse birth outcomes and long-term risks for offspring, such as fetal overgrowth and neonatal complications. However, the impact of GDM managed through nutritional counselling, with or with- out additional medical treatment, on birth outcomes as well as early neurocognitive and motor development remains unclear. Furthermore, how these effects interact with other maternal metabolic factors during pregnancy has yet to be fully understood. This study investigates the influence of well-controlled GDM on neonatal characteristics such as birth age and weight, as well as neurocognitive and metabolic variables later in childhood.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed birth outcomes in N = 539 neonates born to mothers with GDM (N = 149) compared to those born to mothers with normoglycemic pregnancies (NGT, N = 390). Birth parameters included birth weight, birth length, gestational age at deliv- ery, and Apgar scores. Neurocognitive and motor development were assessed at 2 years (N = 115) using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III). At 6 years (N = 79), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) was used to assess general cognitive ability. Anthropometric measures, including BMI and blood pressure, were recorded at both ages. Statistical analyses included cor- relation analysis, general linear models, and stepwise regression to assess the independent effects of maternal GDM on neonatal and child- hood outcomes while adjusting for relevant covariates such as maternal HOMA-IR, gestational weight gain, or oral glucose tolerance data.

**Results:**
Neonates of mothers with well-controlled GDM did not signif- icantly differ from controls in birth outcomes (all p > 0.05). Similarly, no significant differences were observed in neurocognitive or motor outcomes at 2 or 6 years of age. Exploratory analyses revealed that specific maternal metabolic parameters, for example HOMA-IR, rather than GDM itself, were associated with less favorable birth outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
Neonates of mothers with well-controlled GDM did not significantly differ from controls in birth outcomes (all p > 0.05). Simi- larly, no significant differences were observed in neurocognitive or motor outcomes at 2 or 6 years of age. Exploratory analyses revealed that specific metabolic parameters, for example HOMA-IR, rather than GDM itself, were associated with less favorable birth outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic complication during pregnancy and is asso- ciated with an increased risk of early-onset cardiovascular disease in offspring. GDM induces a range of metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory changes that may adversely affect fetal development and vascular health. In this study, we analyzed umbilical cord blood plasma (UCP) to assess the effects of GDM on fetal markers of cardiovascular stress and vascular function, including circulating bioactive factors and the outgrowth of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs).

**Materials and methods:**
Umbilical cord blood samples were col- lected from pregnancies with normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n=59) and GDM (diagnosed according to IADPSG criteria, n=24) at the Medical University of Graz, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Ethics approval: 29-319 ex 16/17). Parameters related to metabolic function (triglycerides, atherogenic index of plasma-AIP), cardiovascular and muscle function (NT-proBNP, CK-MB, myoglobin), inflammation and endothelial function (IL6, ICAM1, ADMA, homo- cysteine), and hormonal regulation (estradiol, cortisol) were measured using a cobas analyzer or commercial ELISA kits. Endothelial health was assessed by quantifying EPC colonies per milliliter of umbilical cord blood. Statistical analyses were conducted using t-tests or Mann- Whitney U tests, and Pearson or Spearman correlations, depending on data distribution; p<0.05 was considered significant.

**Results:**
UCP from GDM pregnancies showed higher levels of NT- proBNP (p=0.037), triglycerides (p=0.013), estradiol (p=0.006), IL6 (p=0.019), and AIP (p=0.012). In GDM pregnancies, negative associations were observed between cardiovascular/muscle param- eters and markers related to inflammation and endothelial function, including between NT-proBNP & IL6 (r=-0.467, p=0.025), myoglobin & homocysteine (r=-0.626, p=0.017), and myoglobin & ICAM1 (r=- 0.492, p=0.032), not observed in NGT. Estradiol correlated positively with IL6 (r=0.453, p<0.001) in NGT. In contrast, in GDM pregnan- cies, estradiol showed broader associations with all inflammatory and endothelial function markers, including strong correlations with ADMA (r=0.618, p=0.004) and IL6 (r=0.563, p=0.004). Notably, only in GDM pregnancies was estradiol positively associated with the num- ber of EPC colonies/ml of cord blood (r=0.411, p=0.046).

**Conclusion:**
The intrauterine environment in GDM shows signs of car- diovascular stress, systemic inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation, as indicated by elevated levels of NT-proBNP, a marker for increased cardiac workload, AIP, IL6, triglycerides, and estradiol. Interestingly, estradiol appears to be more closely linked to inflammatory and vas- cular stress pathways in GDM than in NGT. The unique association between estradiol and EPC outgrowth in GDM pregnancies may reflect a fetal attempt to counteract endothelial dysfunction through enhanced progenitor cell mobilization. However, whether this response is protec- tive or indicative of vascular stress remains to be determined.

**Background and aims:**
Evidence has shown that women with gesta- tional diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at risk of adverse cardiometabolic health outcomes. Healthy diet interventions are now commonly advo- cated as the “new medicine” in managing metabolic disorders, hence this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to investigate postpartum dietary patterns and its impact on cardiometabolic outcomes among women with a history of GDM.

**Materials and methods:**
Five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane) were searched for articles pub- lished between January 1980 and December 2024 that reported post- partum dietary patterns or intervention in women with a history of GDM. Observational studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Data from RCTs were analysed using random-effects meta-analysis to investigate the effect of different postpartum dietary interventions on the cardiometabolic profile of women diagnosed with GDM, and pooled mean difference (MD) was calculated, with corre- sponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed via Cochran Q-test and ­I statistic with two-sided p values.

**Results:**
Twenty-two studies were included in the systematic review and twelve RCTs were included for meta-analysis. Even though obser- vational studies advocated a favourable impact of healthy dietary pat- terns (e.g., Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, alternate Mediterranean Diet), the meta-analysis showed that RCTs with 12 weeks to 2 years follow-up varied in different cardiometabolic pro- files. Compared with controls, dietary intervention improved mater- nal postpartum weight change (MD -0.79 kg [95% CI: -1.33, -0.25]), BMI (-0.49 kg/m [-0.87, -0.10], waist circumference (-1.47 cm [-2.54, -0.41]) and total cholesterol (-0.21 mmol/L [-0.37, -0.05]), but had no effect on fasting blood glucose (-0.24 mmol/L [-0.59, 0.10]), 2-hour blood glucose (0.17 mmol/L [-0.25, 0.58]), systolic blood pressure (0.25 mmHg [-3.05, 3.54]), diastolic blood pressure (-1.29 mmHg [-6.41, 3.83]), and triglyceride (-0.02 mmol/L [-0.42, 0.39]). Interest- ingly, larger improvements could be more influenced by dietary inter- vention in a shorter duration of less than 6 months, compared to longer interventions; this was seen in the weight change (≤ 6 months: -1.90 kg [-3.68, -0.13] vs. > 6 months: -0.52 kg [-0.95, -0.09]) and waist circumference category (≤ 6 months: -3.62 cm [-4.85, -2.38] vs. > 6 months: -0.64 cm [-1.37, 0.08]). Due to limited RCTs reporting similar dietary interventions, we could not further analyse the effect of specific dietary pattern on maternal outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
This study suggests that short term postpartum dietary patterns and interventions might better improve cardio-metabolic out- comes of mothers with a history of GDM. Clinicians could consider other methods of managing cardiometabolic outcomes of patients with prior GDM in the long term, including physical activity and pharma- cological interventions. Ultimately, this should still be done in tandem with dietary interventions.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a heterogene- ous disease. This study aimed to compare clinical-metabolic features and neonatal outcomes among subgroups of women with GDM, classi- fied based on fasting and/or post-load hyperglycemia during the screen- ing oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

**Materials and methods:**
Women with GDM were retrospectively classified into three groups, based on the presence of isolated fasting hyperglycemia (glucose 0’≥92 mg/dL: Group 1), isolated post-load hyperglycemia (glucose 60’≥180 mg/dL and/or glucose 120’≥ 153 mg/dL: Group 2) or both fasting and post-load hyperglycemia (glucose 0’≥92 mg/dL and glucose 60’≥180 mg/dL and/or glucose 120’≥153 mg/dL: Group 3) at the screening OGTT. Clinical-metabolic features and neonatal outcomes were compared across the three groups using ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis, Kruskal-Wallis, and chi- square tests, as appropriate.

**Results:**
Out of 1626 GDM women assessed, 695 (43%) were classified in Group 1, 601 (37%) in Group 2, and 330 (20%) in Group 3. No sig- nificant differences were found among the three groups regarding age, family history of type 2 diabetes, or previous GDM. Women in Group 1 had higher fasting glucose levels in the first trimester compared to Group 2, but lower than Group 3. Women in Group 2 had lower pre- gestational BMI and gestational weight gain at the screening OGTT. They also had lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to the other groups. Women in Group 3 were more frequently of high-risk ethnicity and had a higher prevalence of pre-gestational obesity. Dur- ing pregnancy, HbA1c and triglyceride levels were lower in women of Group 2, whereas women of Group 3 required insulin therapy more frequently. Among insulin-treated women, those in Group 1 more often required basal insulin alone, while those in Group 2 had a higher fre- quency of pre-prandial insulin use and the basal-bolus regimen was most used in women of Group 3. Regarding neonatal outcomes, the prevalence of LGA was higher in women of Group 3, while women of Group 2 had the lowest prevalence of adverse outcomes. At the first post-partum follow-up, the prevalence of normal glucose tolerance was higher in women of Group 2, while impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes were more common in those of Group 3 (Table 1).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings confirm the heterogeneity of women with GDM in terms of clinical-metabolic profile, treatment, neonatal out- comes, and postpartum glucose metabolism alterations. Women with isolated fasting hyperglycemia at OGTT exhibit an intermediate phe- notype between those with isolated post-load hyperglycemia (more favorable profile) and those with both fasting and post-load hyper- glycemia (less favorable profile). These results highlight the need for tailored treatment and prevention strategies for each specific subgroup of women.

2. Switzerland, Lausanne University Hospital and Univeristy of Laus-

**Background and aims:**
Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have increased risk of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and low-grade systemic inflammation in the postpartum. Higher cardi- orespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscular strength (MS) are associated with improved metabolic outcomes in the general population, but data in women with GDM are lacking. We investigated the longitudinal associations between CRF and MS during pregnancy with glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and inflammation parameters at 1-year postpartum in women with GDM.

**Materials and methods:**
This is a secondary analysis of the MySweetHeart trial, which included 179 women with GDM. Dur- ing pregnancy, CRF was assessed using the Chester Step test, and MS was measured via handgrip strength and adjusted for body mass index (BMI) during pregnancy. At one-year postpartum, participants underwent a 75g oral glucose tolerance test, and we calculated HOMA-IR and MATSUDA index. We calculated glucose intoler- ance and assessed metabolic syndrome (MetS)and c-reactive protein (CRP) at 1-year postpartum.

**Results:**
Higher CRF during pregnancy was associated with lower risk of glucose intolerance, MetS, and insulin resistance at one-year postpartum (all p≤0.047). These associations were attenuated after adjusting for classical diabetes risk factors including family history of diabetes, age, ethnicity, and pre-pregnancy BMI. Higher MS dur- ing pregnancy was associated with lower CRP, HOMA-IR, higher MATSUDA index, and reduced MetS (BMI-based) at one-year post- partum, the latter three even independent of classical diabetes risk factors (all p≤0.043).

**Conclusion:**
In this longitudinal cohort of women with GDM, higher CRF and MS during pregnancy were protective of adverse metabolic health outcomes at 1-year postpartum. The relationship between MS and metabolic health was independent of classical diabetes risk factors.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes distress (DD) is an understudied aspect of gestational diabetes (GDM) despite its potential impact on diabetes management. This study aimed to assess the incidence of DD and its distribution across four DD sources. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between DD and glycemic parameters.

**Materials and methods:**
A prospective cohort study was conducted at the single-center outpatient clinic. Women diagnosed with GDM completed a Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS-17). Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) data were analyzed from GDM diagnosis until the last medical check-up. The primary outcomes were glyce- mic parameters, including the average number of SMBG readings per day, mean fasting and postprandial glucose concentration, and percentage of SMBG within the target range. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences among women with low, moderate, and high levels of DD regarding outcomes. Post hoc tests were per- formed using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

**Results:**
Of 312 women (age: 31.7±4.9 years, body mass index: 25.7±5.5 kg/m ) included, 60 (19.2 %) experience moderate DD, and 64 (20.5 %) high DD. The most common sources of DD were emotional and regimen DD, with 88 (28.2 %) women reporting high emotional distress and 79 (25.3 %) reporting high regimen distress. High levels of physician and interpersonal distress were experienced by 62 (19.9 %) of women. Women with high levels of DD had higher fasting glucose concentration (5.0 [4.8-5.2] vs. 4.9 [4.7-5.1] mmol/l; p = 0.024) and a lower percentage of SMBG readings within the target range (79.6 [71.8-90.8] vs. 84.0 [78.7-92.0] %; p = 0.033). Except for interpersonal distress, women with high levels of different sources of DD (emotional, regimen, physician) had a higher risk of poorer glycemic control (Table 1).

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, our study highlights that 40 % of women experience at least moderate levels of DD. Moreover, we identified significant associations between overall DD, its specific sources, and glycemic parameters. Our results warrant replication, but further studies should also focus on developing interventions for reducing DD.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associ- ated with increased neonatal birthweight and a higher risk of obstetric and neonatal complications. Even when maternal glucose levels are adequately controlled, the likelihood of elevated birthweight persists, suggesting that factors beyond glycemia may influence fetal growth. This study investigates maternal determinants of fetal growth and birthweight in high-risk GDM pregnancies, focusing on metabolic and anthropometric factors.

**Materials and methods:**
This is a retrospective cohort study of 561 women with singleton pregnancies complicated by GDM, diagnosed between 24-28 weeks of gestation using a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) per WHO criteria in our institution. Women in this cohort are classified as high-risk GDM defined as: (1) diabetic-range glu- cose levels on OGTT, (2) diagnosis of GDM before 24 weeks, or (3) requiring total insulin doses exceeding 20 units during antepartum period. Fetal growth was assessed with ultrasound growth scans at 30-32 weeks and 34-36 weeks. Maternal clinical data, including pre- pregnancy weight, OGTT results, and HbA1c levels at 24-28 weeks and estimated fetal weight (EFW) and abdominal circumference (AC) were collected. Univariate and multiple regression analyses, adjusted for gestational age and parity, were conducted to evaluate the influence of maternal factors on fetal growth and birthweight.

**Results:**
Complete data were available for 392 women. Pre-pregnancy maternal weight was a significant predictor of EFW and AC at both 30-32 weeks (EFW: β = 0.16, p <0.001; AC: β = 0.18, p <0.001) and 34-36 weeks (EFW: β = 0.25, p <0.001; AC: β = 0.22, p <0.001). Higher EFW and AC at both 30-32 weeks (EFW: β = 0.51, p <0.001; AC: β = 0.52, p <0.001) and 34-36 weeks (EFW: β = 0.69, p <0.001; AC: β = 0.70, p <0.001) were strongly associated with increased birthweight. Notably, OGTT glycemic thresholds (fasting, 1-hour, and 2-hour values) did not predict EFW or AC. However, HbA1c levels at 24-28 weeks correlated with birthweight (β = 0.11, p = 0.02) but did not influence ultrasound-measured growth parameters. Ethnicity also played a role: Indian women had the lowest birthweight (β = -0.13, p = 0.004), and their babies exhibited a smaller AC at 34-36 weeks (β = -0.14, p = 0.021) but not at 30-32 weeks (β = -0.11, p = 0.052). Ethnic- ity did not significantly affect EFW at either time point.

**Conclusion:**
Pre-pregnancy maternal weight significantly predicted fetal growth and birthweight, while HbA1c at mid-pregnancy influ- enced birthweight but not fetal growth trajectories. These findings sug- gest early fetal growth may be intrinsic and less influenced by maternal glycemia. Ethnicity influenced birthweight and late-trimester AC, with Indian women having smaller neonates. Further research is needed to explore the interplay between glycemia, maternal metabolic factors, and fetal growth in multiethnic Asian populations to optimize antenatal management strategies for GDM pregnancies.

1. PSM, JIPMER, Puducherry, India, JIPMER, Puducherry, India.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is the most common medical complication of pregnancy. Data is inconclu- sive regarding the association of type of conception with pregnancy outcomes in women with GDM. This secondary analysis of data aimed to compare the pregnancy outcomes between spontaneous and assisted conception in women with GDM.

**Materials and methods:**
This is a secondary analysis of data from a retrospective observational cohort study in the Department of Obstet- rics and Gynecology of a tertiary care institute in South India. Data on women with GDM were merged from previous studies conducted from Jan 2017 to December 2023. 2401 pregnant women>18 years of age with singleton foetus and diagnosed as GDM with 75gram oral glucose tolerance test using IADPSG criteria were included. Women with Type 1 / 2 Diabetes Mellitus and long-term steroid use were excluded. Details of the risk factors, including demographic charac- teristics, clinical features, and pregnancy outcomes, were recorded. The participants were divided into two groups based on the type of con- ception, namely Spontaneous and Assisted- Ovulation Induction(OI), Intrauterine insemination(IUI), and Assisted reproductive technology( ART). Statistical analysis was performed with Stat V14. Chi-square and Student’s t-test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The strength of the association was reported as a Relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
Among 2401 participants with GDM, 2309(96.2%) had conceived spontaneously, and 92 (3.8%) had assisted conception- OI(37%), IUI(13%), In vitro fertilization (39%) and Intracytoplasmic sperm injection(11%). There was a significantly higher proportion of primigravida (82.6%vs 52.1%, p<0.001), polycystic ovarian disease (42.4% vs 10.3%,p<0.001), early GDM(35.9% vs 19.5%, p<0.001) and need for pharmacotherapy(62% vs 34.3%,p<0.001) in GDM women who had assisted compared to spontaneous conception. Maternal out- comes, namely preeclampsia( 23.9% vs 6.2%, RR:3.83,95%CI:2.58- 5.70,p<0.001), recurrent infections( 5.4% vs 0.3%, RR:20.91,95%CI: 6.50-67.28,p<0.001), preterm premature rupture of membranes (15.2%vs2.7%, RR:5.66,95%CI:3.30-9.74,p<0.001), oligohydram- nios (19.6% vs 12%, RR:1.61,95%CI:1.05-2.48,p=0.028), preterm birth(29.3% vs 7.1%, RR: 4.13,95%CI:2.91-5.86,p<0.001), poor gly- caemic control( 24% vs 13.6%, RR:1.75,95%CI:1.20-2.56,p=0.003) and caesarean section (53.2% vs 29.2%, RR: 1.82,95%CI:1.49- 2.22,p<0.001)were significantly higher in GDM women who had assisted conception relative to spontaneous group. Neonatal outcomes such as low birth weight babies(47.9% vs 17.8%, RR:2.69, 95%CI:2.13- 3.37, p<0.001), neonatal hypoglycaemia (33.7% vs 15.8%, RR:2.14, 95%CI:1.58-2.89,p<0.001), Neonatal intensive care admission (45.7% vs 24%, RR:1.90,95%CI:1.50-2.40,p<0.001)and respiratory distress syndrome(19.6% vs 10.4% RR: 1.89,95%CI:1.23-2.90,p=0.004) were significantly higher in GDM women who had assisted conception rela- tive to spontaneous conception.

**Conclusion:**
GDM women who had conceived by Assisted concep- tion methods appear to have significantly higher adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes when compared to spontaneous conception.

**Background and aims:**
Spexin is a novel bioactive peptide involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, yet its role in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains unclear. This study investigates the relation- ship between Spexin, obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and glucose-lipid metabolism in Chinese pregnant women, while assessing its predictive value for GDM.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study included 70 GDM patients and 70 healthy pregnant women. Serum Spexin levels were measured using ELISA, and the Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) index was used to assess IR. Participants were categorized based on body mass index (BMI) (normal weight vs. overweight/obese) and Triglyceride- Glucose (TyG) index quartiles. Statistical analyses included Chi-square tests, Pearson correlation, multivariate regression, and ROC curve analysis to evaluate Spexin’s association with metabolic parameters and its diagnostic potential for GDM.

**Results:**
Serum Spexin levels were significantly higher in GDM patients than in controls (3666.27±1009.09 vs. 2442.7±823.07 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Spexin positively correlated with BMI, fasting glucose, and postprandial glucose levels.Regression analysis identified BMI as an independent predictor of Spexin in GDM patients. ROC analysis demonstrated that Spexin has high diagnostic value for GDM (AUC = 0.831). Spexin is closely linked to glucose-lipid metabolism in GDM, and elevated Spexin levels may indicate an increased risk of GDM.

**Conclusion:**
While Spexin shows promise as a diagnostic biomarker, its relationship with BMI and insulin resistance requires further investigation.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes during pregnancy significantly ele- vates risks for both mother and baby. In South Carolina (SC), risks are further exacerbated by disparities in maternal health and access to healthcare according to race, income, and geography. Diabetes in preg- nancy requires expert, team-based care, responsive to the real-life needs of women. Three pro- grams aim to provide integrated ‘one stop shop’ multidisciplinary care and to empower patients through education, bringing lifelong benefit for both mother and child.

**Materials and methods:**
The SCMOMs programs were established in 2020 at a medical university and two hospitals. Key team members: specialists in Maternal Fetal Medicine, Endocrinology, RN/RD Dia- betes Educators, a Navigator, Retinal Screening services, Community Health Worker and Telemedicine support. De-identified clinical data were collected and integrated into a central repository. Outcomes were compared between SCMOMs (n = 2,225; 2020-2024) and a comparator cohort (COMP, n = 994; 2017-2019), after adjustment for diabetes type and race. Paired T-tests or two-proportion Z-tests (two-tailed) were used to assess statistical significance (p<0.05). In MOMs, maternal HbA1c was tracked through pregnancy in those with pregestational diabetes, and for those with GDM, the proportion achieving a mean HbA1c < 48 mmol/l (<6.5%) in the third trimester was calculated.

**Results:**
In pregestational patients with HbA1c in all three trimesters, HbA1c improved from 60 to 49 mmol/l (7.6% to 6.6%, n=111) in T1DM patients and from 63 to 46 mmol/l (7.9% to 6.4%, n=190) in T2DM patients between ­1 and ­2 trimesters (both p<0.001), and was sustained thereafter; and 98% of A1GDM patients and 91% of A2GDM patients had ­3 trimester HbA1c < 48 mmol/l (<6.5%). Comparing pregnancy outcomes SCMOMs v. COMP, SCMOMs was associated with fewer C-sections, NICU admissions, pre-term and LGA births and episodes of neonatal hypoglycemia, and improved APGAR scores (Table).

**Conclusion:**
Establishment of integrated care for diabetic pregnancy mitigates severely adverse current maternal and infant outcomes in South Carolina.

5. gapore, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.

**Background and aims:**
A growing body of evidence indicates that gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects neuro-cognitive function in offspring. To provide a comprehensive overview of how GDM is associated with maternal and intergenerational neuro-cognitive func- tion, assessed through various scales and definitions, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize existing studies.

**Materials and methods:**
We searched four databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus) for articles published between January 1980 and September 2024 that reported on GDM and neuro- cognitive outcomes in both mothers and offspring. Both observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. We collected data across four major clusters: neuro-cognitive function assessments, intelligence assessments, brain measurements, and neu- rodevelopmental disorders. We calculated pooled mean differences (MD) and pooled risk ratios (RR) using adjusted risk estimates reported in each study, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q-test and I² statistic, with two-sided p-values.

**Results:**
We included six studies on maternal postpartum neuro-cog- nitive function and 48 studies on offspring neuro-cognitive function following delivery in this systematic review and meta-analysis. All included studies were observational; no randomized controlled tri- als were eligible. Overall, mothers with a history of GDM scored an average of 2.47 points lower on the MoCA compared to those with- out GDM (MD -2.47; 95% CI [-4.16, -0.78], p<0.01). Offspring born from GDM-complicated pregnancies demonstrated lower IQ scores (MD -3.92, 95% CI: -4.86, -2.99), reduced verbal crystallized intelli- gence (MD -3.18, 95% CI: -3.85, -2.51), and lower BDNF levels (MD -694.57; 95% CI: -1379.74, -9.40). Additionally, these children faced higher risks of total and partial developmental delays (RR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.03), ADHD (RR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.72), and autistic spectrum disorders (RR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.27, 1.92). However, we found no differences in major brain structure or general cognitive scores assessed by the Bayley or ASQ scales between offspring exposed to GDM and those who were not.

**Conclusion:**
This study suggests that pregnancies complicated by GDM are associated with neuro-cognitive decline in both mothers and offspring, as indicated by a decline in intellectual function and an increase of disorders in offspring, assessed using neurocognitive screening tools. Therefore, further research on cognitive functions related to GDM is essential for postpartum follow-up, particularly given the increasing prevalence of GDM in pregnancies.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is a condition characterized by high blood sugar levels in pregnant women who did not have diabetes before pregnancy. Its prevalence has been rising globally, especially among Asian populations. GDM poses seri- ous health risks for both mothers and their newborns. Currently, GDM is classified mainly based on glucose levels, overlooking important factors like lipid metabolism and blood pressure regulation, which could help identify various risks for fetal growth and neonatal health. This study aims to use data-driven clustering techniques to analyze pre-pregnancy maternal characteristics, first trimester lipid and blood pressure profiles, and Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) results from 24-28 weeks. We also seek to explore how these identified groups relate to fetal growth and neonatal outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective cohort study evaluated pregnant women with comprehensive details about their sociodemo- graphic and clinical characteristics. After excluding participants with incomplete data, we analyzed 2,523 women diagnosed with GDM according to IADPSG guidelines. We employed K-medoids cluster- ing to identify distinct subgroups based on OGTT results and clinical variables, including maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI (ppBMI), tri- glycerides, HDL, LDL, and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Differences in sociodemographic and clinical traits among the subgroups were ana- lyzed using ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Modified Poisson Regression was conducted to assess the associations between GDM subgroups and fetal growth and neonatal outcomes.

**Results:**
The cluster analysis identified three distinct GDM subgroups. Significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics were observed among these groups (Group 1: n=1,026; Group 2: n=770; Group 3: n=727). Group 2 had the lowest percentage of college gradu- ates, yet the highest pre-pregnancy BMI, triglycerides, SBP, and LDL levels in the first trimester, as well as the highest OGTT fasting glucose levels at second trimester. Mothers classified in Group 2 were found to have the highest risks for accelerated abdominal circumference and estimated fetal weight throughout pregnancy, as well as a higher likeli- hood of having large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, primary cesar- ean deliveries, preterm births, and needing medication (such as insulin or metformin) during pregnancy, all with p-values <0.05.

**Conclusion:**
These findings highlight the existence of different sub- groups of GDM and their associations with fetal growth and neonatal outcomes. This underlines the importance of classifying GDM patients into specific subgroups based on distinct clinical profiles. Such stratifi- cation may enhance the management of GDM, taking into account the diverse mechanisms underlying the condition.

6. melweis University Faculty of Medicine, Budapest, Hungary, UCL

**Background and aims:**
We showed that the use of the WHO-2013 diagnostic criteria almost doubles the prevalence of gestational dia- betes mellitus (GDM), while the use of the NICE-2015 criteria only increases it moderately. We aimed to describe characteristics of GDM pregnancies (based on WHO-2006, WHO-2013, or NICE-2015 crite- ria) stratified by participation in diabetes care during pregnancy.

**Materials and methods:**
As part of a population-based GDM screen- ing program in Western Hungary in 1/MAY/2009-31/DEC/2018, we collected data on 10,264 singleton pregnancies with term delivery. Of these 9,594 (93.5%) had data on a successful 3-point OGTT and anthro- pometrics. All women who screened positive on any of the 3 GDM diagnostic criteria were offered treatment and care according to the recommendations of the Hungarian Diabetes Association.

**Results:**
Of the 9,594 pregnancies, GDM was diagnosed in 10.2% by WHO-2006, 11.9% by NICE-2015, and in 17.7% by WHO-2013. The number of untreated and treated GDM cases were 215/764 (WHO- 2006), 314/828 (NICE-2015), and 811/891 (WHO-2013). As the between group differences in the outcomes were similar independ- ent of the diagnostic criteria used, we report detailed results only for WHO-2013. Both treated and untreated GDM cases were older than controls (p<0.0001), while treated cases were older than untreated cases (p=0.026; treated vs untreated GDM vs control: 31.8±5.3 vs 31.2±5.3 vs 29.4±5.6 years). Controls had lower weight before preg- nancy compared to both GDM groups (p<0.0001) but the GDM groups had similar weights (treated 73.1±18.4 vs untreated 72.2±18.5 vs con- trol 64.0±14.3 kg). Weight gain until the screening OGTT was similar (p=0.12) in controls (6.4±4.2 kg) and untreated GDM cases (6.2±5.3 kg), while it was higher among treated GDM cases compared to the other 2 groups (both p<0.0001; 7.5±6.4 kg). Weight gain during preg- nancy was similar (p=0.12) among untreated GDM cases (12.6±5.9 kg) and controls (13.5±5.1 kg), while it was lower in the treated GDM group (both p<0.0001; 9.4±5.3 kg). Birthweight (3339±544 g vs 3452±545 g, p<0.0001), as well as the rate of macrosomia (15.2% vs 10.3%, p=0.003) was lower among treated vs untreated GDM preg- nancies. The rate of caesarean sections were lower among treated vs untreated GDM pregnancies according to the NICE-2015 criteria (42.6% vs 49.7%, p=0.03), while we found no difference when the WHO-2006 (44.6% vs 46.5%) or the WHO-2013 criteria (43.7% vs 43.9%) were used (both p<0.50).

**Conclusion:**
Although treated GDM women had a worse risk profile before pregnancy and a higher weight gain before OGTT, their weight gain during the whole pregnancy was lower than untreated GDM and control patients. Treatment of GDM was associated with better fetal characteristics (birthweight, macrosomia), however the association with the rate of caesarean sections was only found in cases diagnosed by the NICE-2015 criteria.

3. Puducherry, India, JIPMER, JIPMER Campus, India.

**Background and aims:**
Recurrence rates of Gestational Diabetes Mel- litus (GDM) are as high as 48%. There is a paucity of evidence on pregnancy outcomes in women with Recurrent GDM. The aim of the study was to compare the pregnancy outcomes between Recurrent and New Onset GDM in multiparous women and factors associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
This prospective cohort study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of a Tertiary Care Institute in South India from September 2022 to June 2024. Two hun- dred and sixty-four multiparous women >18 years of age with singleton fetus and diagnosed as GDM based on 75gram OGTT using IADPSG criteria were recruited to the study. Women with Overt DM, Type 1 and Type 2 DM and long-term steroid use were excluded. 54 women with Recurrent GDM and 210 women with New onset GDM were followed till delivery. Demographic characteristics, clinical profile details, and maternal and perinatal outcomes were recorded. The Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables, and the Student t-test was used to compare continuous variables. A logistic regression analysis was done to identify the association of risk factors with adverse preg- nancy outcomes. The strength of the association of Recurrent GDM with adverse pregnancy outcomes was reported as odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval, and adjusted OR (aOR) was calculated after adjusting for potential confounders. A p-value of < 0.05 was consid- ered statistically significant.

**Results:**
The mean age of the study participants was 27.9 years; 6.1% had conceived with Assisted reproductive techniques, and 95.5% were Overweight /Obese, with no significant difference between the groups. Mean blood glucose at fasting and 1 hour were 3 mg/dl and 11 mg/dl higher in the Recurrent GDM group than New onset GDM (p=0.007 and p=0.0001, respectively). Hypothyroidism (33.3% vs 10%, p<0.001), need for Metformin (27.8% vs 16.2%, p=0.001) and both Insulin and Metformin (13% vs 2.4%, p=0.001) were signifi- cantly higher in women with Recurrent GDM vs New onset GDM. Low Apgar Score at 1 minute (29.6 vs 9.8%, aOR:5.18, 95% CI: 2.13-12.60, p=0.000) and Need for Resuscitation (51.9 vs 32.7%, aOR: 2.33,95% CI: 1.23-4.40,p=0.009) were significantly higher in women with Recurrent GDM in comparison with New onset GDM after adjusting for factors(age, BMI, Gestational age at delivery and need for hypoglycemic drugs) that were significantly associated with these outcomes. Antepartum haemorrhage, stillbirth, very low birth weight babies and neonatal deaths were observed only in multiparous women with New onset GDM.

**Conclusion:**
Multiparous women with Recurrent GDM had a signifi- cantly higher proportion of neonates with low Apgar score at 1 min- ute and need for resuscitation when compared to New onset GDM. Factors, namely maternal age >35 years, high BMI, prematurity and need for pharmacotherapy, appeared to be significantly associated with these adverse pregnancy outcomes in multiparous women with Recurrent GDM relative to New onset GDM.

1. Obstetrics and Gynaecology, JIPMER, Puducherry, India, JIPMER,

**Background and aims:**
Recurrent gestational diabetes mellitus (RGDM) refers to the reoccurrence of GDM in subsequent pregnan- cies, indicating a higher predisposition to pregnancy complications. Data is lacking in the Indian context regarding maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with RGDM. The aim of this secondary analysis of data from a retrospective cohort was to compare the pregnancy outcomes between RGDM and Non-recurrent GDM.

**Materials and methods:**
This is a secondary analysis of the data from a retrospective cohort study in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of a tertiary care institute in South India. Data on women with GDM were merged from previous studies conducted from Jan 2017 to December 2023. 2401 pregnant women>18 years of age with singleton foetus and diagnosed as GDM with 75gram oral glucose tolerance test using IADPSG criteria were included. Women with Type 1/2 DM and long-term steroid use were excluded. Details of risk factors, including demographic characteristics, clini- cal features, and pregnancy outcomes, were recorded. The partici- pants were divided into two groups -Recurrent and Non-recurrent GDM. Statistical analysis was performed with Stat V14. Chi-square and Student’s t-test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The strength of the association was reported as a relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval(CI). A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
Among 2401 participants, 322 had RGDM (13.4%). 2,079(86.6%) had non-recurrent GDM, of which 42.8% were mul- tigravidae. Mean age (28.7+4.5 vs 27.6 +4.3 years, p<0.001), polycystic ovarian disease (33.9% vs 8.1%, p<0.001), family history of T2DM (39.1% vs 14.2%, p<0.001)and need for pharmacother- apy (45.3%vs 33.7%,p<0.001) were significantly higher in RGDM vs non-recurrent GDM. Maternal outcomes such as preeclampsia (9.7 vs 6.5%, RR: 1.48, 95%CI: 1.02-2.15, p=0.038), DKA (0.9% vs 0.2%, RR: 4.84, 95%CI:1.09-21.53, p=0.038), recurrent infec- tions(1.2 vs 0.3%, RR: 3.69, 95%CI:1.09-12.53,p=0.036), prema- ture rupture of membranes(42% vs 26.4%, RR:1.59, 95%CI:1.37- 1.84,p<0.001), oligohydramnios(17.4% vs 11.6%, RR: 1.50, 95%CI:1.15-1.96,p=0.003), polyhydramnios(17.7% vs 7%, RR:2.54, 95%CI:1.91-3.37,p<0.001), poor adherence to interventions (26.7% vs12.1%, RR: 2.20,95%CI:1.78-2.73, p<0.001) ,poor glycaemic con- trol (26.4% vs12%, RR: 2.19, 95%CI:1.76-2.71, p <0.001), caesar- ean section(35.7% vs 29.3%, RR: 1.22, 95%CI:1.04-1.43,p=0.017) and postpartum haemorrhage (9% vs 3.6%, RR: 2.50, 95%CI:1.65- 3.77, p<0.001)were significantly higher in RGDM vs non-recurrent GDM. Neonatal outcomes, namely Macrosomia(14% vs 6.3%, RR: 2.21, 95%CI:1.61-3.04,p<0.001), shoulder dystocia(5.9% vs1.6%, RR: 3.72, 95%CI:2.14-6.46,p<0.001), neonatal jaundice (10.2% vs 5%, RR: 2.02, 95%CI:1.40-2.95,p=<0.001)/ hypoglycaemia (27.3% vs 14.8%, RR: 1.85, 95%CI:1.50-2.27,p<0.001), NICU admis- sion(32.3% vs 23.7% RR:1.36, 95%CI:1.14-1.62,p=0.001) and RDS (17.4% vs9.7%, RR:1.80, 95%CI:1.37-2.36,p<0.001)were signifi- cantly higher in RGDM relative to non-recurrent GDM.

**Conclusion:**
Women with RGDM demonstrate a significantly increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes compared to non-recurrent GDM. Future prospective studies with large sample sizes and long-term follow-up are required to understand better the pregnancy outcomes in women with RGDM.

**Background and aims:**
Disproportionate exposure to diabetes- associated natural environment (i.e., air pollution, greenness, and temperature) may contribute to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk disparities across areas and social environment attributes (e.g., ethnic concentration). However, comprehensive evidence on the link between natural environment and GDM is limited. This study aims to examine this link and its intersections with social factors at the local area level over time in Australia.

**Materials and methods:**
A multistate population-level study at the Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2), a medium-sized spatial resolution, was conducted using data from 2016 through 2022. SA2-level annual GDM cases and births/sociodemographic data were obtained from the National Diabetes Services Scheme and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Spatiotemporal model-based satellite-driven annual green- ness, air pollution, and temperature measures at the SA2 level were used. Ethnic concentration per area was measured using location quotient. Spatiotemporal ecological regression was employed, with an adjusted risk ratio and 95% credible interval. Effect modification by neighbourhood socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and urbanicity was examined.

**Results:**
We included 241,264 GDM cases among 2,035,100 women across 1,977 SA2s. An increase in greenness was associated with an 11% (0.89 [0.83-0.95]) reduction in GDM risk. GDM risk decreased by 13% (0.87 [0.78-0.97]) in metropolitan residents (vs regional), 17% (0.83 [0.76-0.89]) in areas with high concentration of migrant women (location quotient ≥1), and 30% (0.70 [0.59-0.83]) in most (vs least) socioeconomically advantaged areas with increase in greenness. High PM2.5 (>5μg/m ) was associated with increased GDM risk in areas with the least (vs greatest) socioeconomic advan- tage (1.44[1.11-1.88]) and high (vs low) concentration of migrants (1.23 [1.05-1.45]).

**Conclusion:**
High residential greenness was associated with lower GDM risk, but the benefit was more pronounced in socioeconomi- cally advantaged areas, for metropolitan residents, and in areas with a high concentration of migrant women. PM2.5-GDM risk associa- tion was amplified in areas of socioeconomically disadvantaged and high concentrations of migrants. GDM risk associated with green- ness and air pollution, notably at the intersectionality of residence, socioeconomic, and ethnic status, indicates the relevance of address- ing social and natural environment health inequities

**Background and aims:**
During pregnancy the endocrine pancreas counteracts increased insulin resistance by increasing in number of the insulin (Ins)-secreting β-cells. Moreover, transdifferentia- tion of glucagon-secreting α-cells or somatostatin (Sst)-secreting δ-cells into β-cells may also occur. A low protein but isocaloric maternal diet during pregnancy (LP) can reduce β-cell mass (BCM) and function in the offspring, including a reduced capacity for β-cell expansion in pregnancy. In this study we sought to examine whether δ-cell mass (DCM) is increased during pregnancy or is altered by nutritional deficiency in early life.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate the origin of new β-cells during pregnancy a transgenic mouse model was used to trace δ-cell lineage fate using a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) as a lineage tag. Pancreatic sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry at ges- tational days (GD) 9, 12, 15, 18, or non-pregnant (NP) female mice, to visualize the presence of Ins, YFP and Sst, where Ins+YFP+Sst- cells represent transdifferentiated δ-cells by confocal microscopy. The image analysis was done through Fiji Image J software. Pregnant (F1) mouse pancreata were also examined in offspring from mothers fed either a control or LP diet throughout pregnancy and lactation.

**Results:**
Both BCM and DCM significantly increased by GD18 compared to NP (GD18, BCM 0.41±0.11 mg (Mean±sem), DCM 0.12±0.04 mg; NP, BCM 0.20±0.04 mg, DCM 0.03±0.01 mg; p<0.05). δ to β-cell ratio was significantly greater by GD18, sug- gesting a relative increase in δ-cell presence. Mice exposed to maternal LP diet in early life exhibited a significantly reduced adaptive increase in BCM (p < 0.05) during pregnancy but the increase in DCM was unaltered. Lineage tracing of δ-cells revealed that an increase in bi-hormonal (Ins+ YFP+ Sst+) cell abun- dance occurred between GD12 and 18, coinciding with the rise in BCM (NP 0.51±0.05 as % of total insulin-stained cells, GD12 0.49±0.07%, GD18 1.43±0.05%, p<0.05), but fully transdifferenti- ated Ins+YFP+Sst- cells were rare.

**Conclusion:**
Findings show that δ-cell mass increases during normal pregnancy and that there is an increase of Ins+YFP+ Sst+ bihormonal cells that may transdifferentiate into β-cells within pancreatic islets, potentially contributing to BCM expansion. Meanwhile in the LP group BCM was stunt but the pregnancy associated increase of DCM was unaffected.

**Background and aims:**
Maternal obesogenic environments during perinatal period may influence central mechanisms involved in energy balance, increasing the risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome later in life. Moreover, these disruptions may also heighten susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders throughout life. However, how these mechanisms are modulated by maternal diet and/or diabetes in the offspring during early infancy remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of maternal obesity and diabetes on sex-specific central energy balance mechanisms during early life.

**Materials and methods:**
To investigate this, three experimental groups were considered: 1) female Wistar rats (12 weeks old) fed a standard diet during pregnancy and lactation (control group, n=6); (2) females fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD group, n=8) for 8 weeks, and (3) a subset of HFD-fed females (n=8) that received a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce type 2 diabetes. Afterward, females were mated with age-matched male Wistar rats. Offspring body weight was monitored weekly, and on the weaning day (P21), a glucose toler- ance test was performed. The offspring were then anesthetized and euthanized via cervical displacement. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hypothalamus were collected for molecular analysis, and plasma was obtained to measure FFA levels. Data were expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and compared using an Ordinary one-way ANOVA test, according to normality evaluation. Values of p<0.05 were considered significant.

**Results:**
During lactation, male and female offspring from HFD and STZ groups presented increased body weight gain (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). On P21, both sexes from HFD and STZ offspring displayed elevated fasting glycemia levels (p<0.05) and impaired response in the glucose tolerance test. Moreover, both male and female from HFD had increased FFA levels (p<0.05), whereas in STZ group only males presented increased FFA levels (p<0.05). These metabolic changes were accompanied by increased neuropep- tide (NPY) receptor levels- NPY1R (p<0.05) and NPY5R (p<0.05) levels in PFC of male offspring from both HFD (p<0.05) and STZ (p<0.05) groups. Additionally, male offspring exhibited increased lev- els of ­GABA receptor ­(GABA r) (p < 0.05) and its associated pro- teins, including glutaminase C (p<0.05), vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) (p<0.05), and gephryn (p<0.05). In male offspring hypothala- mus from HFD group, NPY1R levels were reduced (p<0.05), with a trend toward NPY5R levels (p=0.07). Regarding female offspring, no significant changes were observed in NPY1R and NPY5R in PFC or hypothalamus. However, HFD exposure led to increased ­GABA r (p<0.05) in PFC of female offspring.

**Conclusion:**
Exposure to unhealthy maternal habits during the peri- natal period predisposes offspring to metabolic alterations, accompa- nied by dysregulation of central neurometabolic and energy balance mechanisms.

**Background and aims:**
Autophagy plays an essential role in main- taining homeostasis of pancreatic beta cells against insulin resist- ance. Insulin resistance physiologically increases during pregnancy to supply nutrients to the fetus. We aim to investigate the hypothesis that autophagy in beta cells also contributes to preserving cellular function in response to insulin resistance during pregnancy and that its impairment is related to the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus.

**Materials and methods:**
First, we investigated the changes in the autophagic flux in pancreatic islets during perinatal periods with pHluorin-LC3-mCherry reporter mice, in which pHluorin/mCherry fluorescence ratio inversely reflects the autophagic flux. Next, we examined glucose tolerance and the beta cell mass with beta cell- specific Atg7 knockout mice (Ins1-Cre: ­Atg7 , Atg7-βKO) in the late stage of pregnancy and after parturition. Then, we performed proteomic analysis to investigate the involvement of the turnover of specific proteins in pancreatic islets during pregnancy. Finally, we explored the relationship between autophagic flux, hormones associated with pregnancy, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.

**Results:**
In pregnant pHluorin-LC3-mCherry mice, the autophagic flux in pancreatic islets decreased in gestational day 18 (pHluorin/ mCherry ratio 1.28 ± 0.07, = 0.034) through postpartum day 1 (1.39 ± 0.17, = 0.034) and increased in postpartum day 21 (0.81 ± 0.08, = 0.030), compared to the non-pregnant mice. The glucose tolerance in Atg7-βKO mice, which was impaired compared to the control mice (Ins1-Cre: ­Atg7 ) in non-pregnant condition, was further deteriorated in gestational day 18 (AUC, area under the curve; 24091 ± 1528 in non-pregnant Atg7-βKO, 32705 ± 2194 in pregnant Atg7-βKO, < 0.01). The glucose intolerance in pregnant Atg7-βKO mice improved to be the same as in non-pregnant Atg7-βKO mice 4 weeks after parturition. In contrast, the increases in beta cell mass during pregnancy and after parturition were comparable between Atg7-βKO and control mice. Proteomic analysis revealed that the proteins associated with ER-phagy, such as TEX264 and CCPG1, were upregulated in islets of pregnant Atg7-βKO mice. Finally, we demonstrated that the downstream proteins in the mTOR pathway, including UNC-5-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), were upregulated during pregnancy.

**Conclusion:**
Though autophagic flux in pancreatic beta cells decreases during pregnancy, the glucose intolerance in Atg7-βKO suggests that autophagy contributes to maintaining beta cell function through the turnover of ER-associated proteins. The mTOR pathway, indispensable to expanding beta cell mass during pregnancy, may regulate ULK1 and modify the autophagic flux, which should be increased in response to insulin resistance.

**Background and aims:**
Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a circulating pool of endothelial cells to maintain endothelial integrity, with a particular role in placental, fetal and neonatal vascularization. EPCs release nitric oxide ( NO), essential in shear stress response, vascular tone regulation, proliferation, angiogenesis, and mitochondrial respiration. Maternal obesity and gestational diabetes (GD) are linked to dysregulated fetoplacental NO levels and modulating NO produc- tion in EPCs has emerged as a potential therapy counteracting vascular dysfunction. Gestational diabesity (GDy), combining obesity and GD, is associated with fetoplacental endothelial dysfunction. We aimed to investigate whether, in fetal EPCs, NO levels are regulated through a signaling cascade initiated by adenosine receptor ­A R stimulation, and ERK1/2 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phospho- rylation, inducing NO production, and whether this pathway is dis- rupted in GDy.

**Materials and methods:**
EPCs were isolated from umbilical cord blood from healthy (control, C; n=20) and GDy (n=8) donors. After 2h serum starvation, EPCs were stimulated with ­A R agonist CGS- 21680 (30nM) or VEGF-165 (25ng/mL) for 5, 15, 30, and 60min. Signaling molecules’ phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblot- ting. Data were tested for normality (Shapiro-Wilk) and analyzed accordingly with parametric or non-parametric tests and correlation analyses.

**Results:**
In unstimulated C EPCs, total eNOS levels positively cor- related with total ERK1/2 (r=0.8; p=0.01) and with CAT-1, the trans- porter of NO-precursor (L-Arginine) (r=0.8; p=0.02). In GDy EPCs, total eNOS was also positively correlated with total ERK1/2 (r=0.9; p=0.005). In C and GDy EPCs, VEGF increased ERK1/2 phosphoryla- tion at 5min (C, p=0.001;GDy, p=0.017). eNOS maximal phosphoryla- tion occurred only 30min after VEGF (C,p=0.009; GDy, p=0.007) and CGS (C,p=0.001; GDy, p=0.007) treatment. However, phosphoryla- tion profiles of ERK1/2 upon CGS (p=0.04 vs. C), and of eNOS upon VEGF (p=0.04 vs. C) treatments differed in GDy vs. C. Additionally, compared to C, ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon VEGF stimulation was increased in GDy at 5 and 15 min (p=0.048 and p=0.01), and eNOS phosphorylation was increased in GDy at 30min of CGS exposure when compared to C (p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
In neonatal EPCs, ­A R stimulation phosphorylated ERK1/2 and, subsequently, eNOS. In GDy, ERK1/2 and eNOS phos- phorylation was increased under various stimuli, indicating a disruption in NO signaling. This mechanism is a promising therapeutic target to modulate NO levels, with potential benefits for treating endothelial dysfunction in conditions such as GD or GDy.

**Background and aims:**
The Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling 2 (SOCS2) modulates cytokine response, body growth, metabolism of lipids and car- bohydrates, and inflammatory responses. We aim to investigate the serum cytokine profile during pregnancy in SOCS2-deficient mice, a model that develops Gestational Diabetes (GDM) and macrosomia.

**Materials and methods:**
The cytokine profile was analyzed using an array of 48-mouse cytokine panel which provides data from biomarkers related to inflammation and immune response. Fasting serum (1μL) was used to analyze cytokines in 4 and 4 (control) females at day 0 (basal), day 14 (gestation) and day 21 (postpartum) of pregnancy (OEBA_ULPGC 17/2024). Results were compared using Mann-Whitney’s U and Student’s tests.

**Results:**
Twenty-three out of 43 cytokines analyzed showed different expression profiles between groups and/or gestational times (Table 1). In the control mice, serum levels of 6 cytokines (IL-12, IL-5, Colony Stim- ulator Factor (CSF)3, Chemokine CXC Ligand (CXCL)1, CXCL-11 and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)21) increased during pregnancy com- pared to baseline and the mice. However, the profile of increased cytokines changed in the postpartum stage (IL-33, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, CXCL2, CXCL9, CCL-11, and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)). In baseline mice, serum levels of 8 cytokines were elevated (IL-6, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-12, TNF-α, CSF3, CXCL2, and CXCL11), while 7 cytokines (IL-33, IL-9, CXCL9, CCL12, CCL11, HGF, and FGF21) were reduced. In pregnant mice, the amount of cytokines levels further increased during gestation (Interferon (IFN)-α2, IL-1α, IL-17F, IL-33, IL-9, IL-22, IL-10, IL-16, IL-2, TNF- α, CXCL-2, CXCL-9, and CCL-12), whereas during postpartum several cytokines remained elevated or increased further (IL-6, IL-1α, IL-9, IL-17F, IL-10, IL-5, IL-16, CXCL9, CCL11, and HGF). Compared to controls( <0.05), baseline females showed higher CSF3 and lower CCL11 levels. During gestation, they exhibited higher levels of IFN-α2 and IL17F but lower levels of FGF21. Finally, in postpartum, serum levels of IL17F and IL12 were higher mice.

**Conclusion:**
Pregnancy constitute a pro-inflammatory condition in both control and mice. However, the absence of SOCS2 exacerbates this condition during pregnancy, potentially contributing to GDM and macrosomia. This heightened pro-inflammatory phenotype suggests that SOCS2 influence the normal cytokine balance during both gestation and postpartum. These findings support the hypothesis that SOCS2 may pro- tect against pregnancy-related complications. Further studies with larger sample sizes will be assessed to confirm these preliminary findings.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance first identified during pregnancy that does not meet the criteria for overt diabetes. Its pathophysiology shares key features with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), including insulin resistance and inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in T2D. This study inves- tigates the expression of lncRNAs in GDM and explores their associa- tion with insulin resistance and proinflammatory cytokines.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study included 25 GDM and 36 non-GDM (NGDM) participants from a tertiary care antena- tal clinic. GDM was diagnosed using a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria. MALAT1, MEG3, and XIST were selected for analysis due to their reported involvement in T2D. Their expression levels were quantified using real-time PCR, while serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and glycemic markers (C-peptide, fasting insulin) were measured using ELISA.

**Results:**
MALAT1, MEG3, and XIST were significantly downregu- lated in the GDM group compared to the NGDM group (p < 0.01). In the GDM group, all three lncRNAs showed a significant negative correlation with Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (MALAT1: r = -0.44, p = 0.03; MEG3: r = -0.46, p = 0.04; XIST: r = -0.45, p = 0.04). Additionally, MALAT1 expression negatively correlated with IL-6 (r = -0.49, p = 0.03) and TNF-α (r = -0.48, p = 0.04). MEG3 and XIST expression negatively correlated with IL-1β (r = -0.51 and -0.50, p = 0.03 for both) and TNF-α (r = -0.47 and -0.52, p = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively).

**Conclusion:**
MALAT1, MEG3, and XIST are downregulated in GDM, and their expression levels are negatively correlated with insulin resist- ance and select proinflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest a potential role for lncRNA downregulation in GDM pathogenesis, war- ranting further investigation.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is defined as the first onset hyperglycemic state during pregnancy that is different from overt diabetes. In GDM, different adipokines may play various types of roles to promote abnormal insulin resistance (IR). Apelin is one of them and it may control low-grade inflamma- tory responses through NLRP3 inflammasome complex formation by NF-κB activation. This prolonged formation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex from the onset to the one year postpartum may play a crucial role in the development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to investigate the role of Apelin in understanding the NLRP3 inflammasome complex formation facilitating the transition from GDM to T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
We recruited 18 GDM and 20 Non-GDM (NGDM) mothers after receiving informed consent from them with the assurance of follow-up. We have collected approximately 6 -8 ml. blood from those mothers in EDTA vial and Clot vial to analyze gene expression of Apelin, Apelin’s Receptor (APJ), NF - κB (RelA subunit) performing real time PCR and NLRP3 expression and serum level concentration of Apelin by ELISA. All the statistical analyses consid- ered significant below the p-value 0.05. Associations were studied by employing Spearman’s correlation.

**Results:**
We found a significant increase in gene expression of Apelin, NF-κB and NLRP3 expression during GDM with a substantial positive correlation between Apelin vs. NF-κB (r = 0.6295; p = 0.0062) and Apelin vs. NLRP3 (r = 0.5265; p = 0.0385). However, we found a sig- nificant decrease in gene expression of Apelin and NF-κB but NLRP3 upregulation was still significantly higher during postpartum GDM with a significant positive correlation between Apelin vs. NLRP3 (r = 0.5629; p = 0.0150). We found a significant protein-level expression of Apelin during GDM.

**Conclusion:**
Apelin may be responsible for the activation of NF-κB as well as NF-κB mediated NLRP3 inflammasome complex formation to promote GDM and downregulation of Apelin and NF-κB genes and upregulation of NLRP3 genes may facilitate the transition from GDM to T2DM.

**Background and aims:**
Maternal type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with an increased risk of metabolic disorders in the offspring. This study investigates their relation with placental microbiota and offspring outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
Samples from the fetal side (amnios) of 14 T1D, 16 T2D, and 18 control mothers, stored at -80°C, were analyzed in triplicate. To control for contamination, 3 DNA extraction kit sam- ples and 6 cesarean section placentas, freshly collected under sterile conditions were examined. Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained. After DNA extraction [E.Z.N.A Universal Pathogen Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Inc.)], the bacterial 16S rRNA V3-V4 region was sequenced [Illumina MiSeq PE300 (StabVida, Portugal)]. Bio- informatic analysis (dada2 and phyloseq in R) and taxonomic annota- tion (Silva database) followed. Contaminants were removed, and data aggregated at the genus level. Unsupervised clustering (Past5, Mega11) and supervised tests (PERMANOVA, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis) were used, and significant genera further analyzed via pairwise com- parisons. Violin plots (ggplot2, R) were used for visualization. Asso- ciation with maternal diabetes, delivery mode, BMI at booking and antibiotic intake and offspring variables (birth weight percentile, BMI at 6 years of age and sex) was assessed.

**Results:**
A total of 12,500 unique sequences assigned to 520 phylo- types across 198 genera were found in 123 placenta samples. Unsu- pervised clustering revealed that T1D samples clustered closely, as did control samples, whereas T2D samples exhibited the highest variability (figure). Significant differences were found for T1D with control (P=0.0002) and T2D (P=0.007). The most notable differences in bacterial genera were within the Firmicutes phylum. Specifically, the Lachnospiraceae ( and the , p<0.001) and Ruminococcaceae families ( and , p<0.001) were significantly more abundant in T1D than controls (figure). No significant differences were observed for the remaining variables.

**Conclusion:**
This study identifies significant differences in placen- tal microbiota between T1D and control mothers. Certain bacteria involved in gut homeostasis and short-chain fatty acid metabolism appear to play a role in these differences and may influence fetal devel- opment. Further research is needed to determine the potential effects on offspring health.

**The role of MAS receptor in the prevention and treatment of poly- cystic ovary syndrome**

X. Cao

**Background and aims:**
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a highly heterogeneous endocrine and metabolic disorder characterized by multi-system dysfunction in women, clinically manifested as repro- ductive comorbidities and endocrine-metabolic disturbances. Studies have demonstrated associations between the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and PCOS pathogenesis. Our research group previously reported that the Mas pathway within the RAS system ameliorates metabolic disorders, while the specific role of the MAS receptor in PCOS remains unclear.

**Materials and methods:**
Mas knockout (Mas -/-) female PCOS mouse and the MAS receptor agonist AVE0991 intervened PCOS mouse were used to analyze the effects of Mas receptors on ovarian morphology and function, hormone levels, estrous cycle, insulin tolerance, fertility, and peripheral tissue metabolism.

**Results:**
In the DHEA induced PCOS mouse model, serum ACE2 con- centration significantly increased. Compared with the wild-type (WT) control group, there was no significant difference in the ovaries of Mas knockout (Mas -/-) mice. In the DHEA induced PCOS mouse model, compared with wild-type mice (WT-PCOS), Mas gene knockout mice (Mas -/-- PCOS) showed male like ovaries, larger ovarian volume, pale surface, and more polycystic expanded follicles; The levels of testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone in the serum of Mas -/- PCOS mice were significantly increased; Ele- vated serum total cholesterol levels; Upregulation of ovarian hormone related genes (Lhegr, P450sc, StAR) expression; There was no signifi- cant difference in glucose tolerance, but insulin sensitivity decreased; Mas -/- PCOS mice experience worsening of their reproductive cycle; Importantly, fertility experiments have shown that the number of mice born to Mas -/- PCOS mice is significantly reduced compared to WT- PCOS mice. In the AVE0991 intervention PCOS mouse model (WT- PCOS+AVE0991), compared with the control group PCOS mice (WT- PCOS), the estrous cycle of WT-PCOS+AVE0991 mice tended to be normal; Fasting blood sugar decreases and weight loss is significant; The expression of ovarian hormone related genes (Cyp19a1, Hsd17b2) decreased; In addition, AVE0991 intervention significantly improved the expression of metabolism related genes in the liver (AOX, HSL, Fabpl), brown adipose tissue (COX4, UQCRC2), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (PPAR γ, ATGL, PGC1 α, AGPAT, and SDHB) of PCOS mice; The most noteworthy thing is that AVE0991 significantly improved the fertility of PCOS mice, and the number of mice born in the WT-PCOS+AVE0991 group was significantly increased compared to the WT-PCOS control group.

**Conclusion:**
This study establishes MAS receptor signaling as a piv- otal modulator of PCOS pathogenesis, revealing its dual regulatory role in both ovarian dysfunction and systemic metabolic derangements, which provides an important potential target for the treatment of PCOS.

**Association of gestational weight gain with adverse pregnancy out- comes in gestational diabetes pregnancies: a secondary analysis of data from a retrospective cohort**

N. Patel

**Background and aims:**
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is the most common medical complication of pregnancy. The prevalence of GDM has increased alongside rising obesity rates and gestational weight gain (GWG) among pregnant women. There is conflicting evi- dence on the association of GWG with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study of women with GDM to determine the associations between GWG cat- egorised as within, below, or above the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
This secondary analysis of a retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in the Department of Obstet- rics and Gynecology at a tertiary care institute in South India. Data on women with GDM were merged from previous studies conducted between January 2017 and December 2023. A total of 2,369 women aged >18 years with a singleton fetus and diagnosed with GDM using the 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test based on IADPSG criteria were included. Women with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and those on long-term steroid use were excluded. Details of risk factors, includ- ing demographic characteristics, clinical features, and maternal and perinatal outcomes, were recorded. Total GWG was classified as inade- quate, adequate, or excessive based on the 2009 IOM guidelines, which recommend weight gains of 13-18 kg for underweight, 11-16 kg for normal BMI, 7-11 kg for overweight, and 5-9 kg for obese women. Sta- tistical analysis was performed using STATA (version 15.1). Multivari- able log-binomial regression was conducted to examine the association between GWG and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Unadjusted relative risks (RRs), adjusted RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
Among the 2,369 women, 0.7% were underweight pre- pregnancy, 47.4% were overweight, and 13.4% were obese. 85% of mothers had a term delivery. According to IOM guidelines, 43.3% had inadequate and 7.8% had excessive GWG. The mean (SD) GWG was 8.8 (2.5) kg, with a median (IQR) of 9 (7-10) kg. Caesarean delivery (30.2%), PROM (28.6%), and oligohydramnios (12.4%) were the most common maternal outcomes, while NICU admission (24.7%), neonatal hypoglycemia (16.3%), and low birth weight (LBW) (18.8%) were the most frequent neonatal adverse outcomes. The prevalence of preec- lampsia (12%, p < 0.05), recurrent infections (2.1%, p < 0.05), and LBW (22.3%, p > 0.05) was higher in women with excessive GWG compared to those with inadequate or adequate GWG. After adjust- ing for potential confounders, women with excessive GWG had a 1.7 times higher risk of preeclampsia (95% CI: 1.1-2.6, p = 0.02) and a 6.6 times higher risk of recurrent infections (95% CI: 1.1-38.8, p = 0.03) compared to those with adequate GWG.

**Conclusion:**
Excessive GWG was associated with a significantly higher risk of preeclampsia and recurrent infections, while other maternal and perinatal outcomes were comparable between inadequate and exces- sive GWG compared to adequate GWG in GDM pregnancies. Future prospective studies with larger sample sizes and long-term follow-up are needed to understand better the impact of inadequate and excessive GWG on pregnancy outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Guidelines recommend avoiding pregnancy during the first two years after bariatric surgery (BS) due to poten- tial risks related to weight loss. Further investigation of standardized screening methods for gestational diabetes (GDM) and thorough follow-up care in pregnancy after BS is needed. We investigated the impact of BS on nutrient supply and maternal glucose metabolism prospectively during pregnancy.

**Materials and methods:**
Data were collected as part of routine clini- cal practice following BS from 38 pregnant women (average age 29.8 [21.4; 35.5] years, 14 each with gastric sleeve and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 5 blinded as part of the BariSurg study, 5 with re-operations), resulting in 68 pregnancies. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on time-to-conception-interval: early (≤12 months, n=7), middle (12- 24 months, n=11), and late (>24 months, n=14). Nutrient supply was assessed through levels of Vitamin A, E, D, B12, folic acid, selenium, zinc, ferritin, transferrin, calcium, magnesium and albumin. GDM was screened using ambulatory glucose profiles (AGP) or oral glucose tol- erance tests (oGTT) (n=53 singleton pregnancies).

**Results:**
A weight loss of 30 % was observed between BS and the first pregnancy (BMI at conception 35.7 [30.7; 45.3] kg/m²). Despite outpatient follow-up care with recommendations for supplementation of critical nutrients, nutrient deficiencies were common, especially for Vitamin D (86 %, 3rd trimester), ferritin and magnesium (both 73 %, 2nd trimester), zinc (57 %, 2nd trimester), Vitamin E (31 %, 3rd trimester), Vitamin B12, and selenium (both 20 %, 3rd trimester). A total of 39 pregnancies (74 %) were screened for GDM (26 with AGP, 22 with oGTT, 9 with both). 6 pregnancies (11 %) were not screened for GDM and for 8 pregnancies (15 %) screening informa- tion could not be obtained. Among the screened pregnancies, 35 % showed an abnormal AGP (2 from the middle and 7 from the late group) and 32 % had an abnormal oGTT (1 each from the early and middle group, 5 from the late group). 8 women were diagnosed with GDM during the first pregnancy after BS (1 from the early and mid- dle group each, 6 from the late group), 4 of them requiring insulin therapy. 5 women had a previously diagnosed history of diabetes, of which none from the early and middle groups and 40% from the late group went in remission after BS.

**Conclusion:**
Pregnant women after BS frequently experience nutri- ent deficiencies despite follow-up care and have an increased risk of GDM. The time interval between surgery and conception alone does not solely determine deficiencies and the development of GDM. Spe- cialized maternal care focusing on nutrient supply and glucose metabo- lism after BS is essential.

2. tralia, Diabetes and Endocrine, Western Sydney University, Camp-

**Background and aims:**
Excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG) is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including pre- eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM),postpartum weight retention (PPWR), and fetal birth defects. . The Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines, developed based on Caucasian populations, are not widely able to applicable to various ethnicities due to unique pheno- types of certain ethnicities. However, emerging evidence suggests that BMI classifications should account for ethnic variations. This study explores the relationship between EGWG and ethnicity, comparing various ethnic groups and BMI classifications to Caucasian women in Sout Western Sydney. The aim is to assess the applicability of IOM guidelines within a multicultural context.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective analysis of antenatal GDM assessment records from two hospitals, involving 1016 participants from South Western Sydney. The study used multivariable regression models to evaluate GWG influenced by ethnicity, BMI classification, and other covariates, refining results through statistical techniques like listwise deletion and stepwise selection.

**Results:**
African, Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern, and Indigenous populations showed significantly higher GWG compared to Cauca- sian populations. Conversely, Southeast Asian and South Asian groups exhibited lower rates of EGWG, predominantly among underweight and normal-weight individuals. South Americans showed universally high EGWG rates, with the average EGWG being lower than that of Caucasian populations by 20%. On average other ethnicities gained 1.3kg more EGWG than Caucasian populations. Pre-pregnancy obe- sity and insulin therapy were significant predictors of EGWG, while a history of GDM was associated with reduced GWG due to stricter dietary adherence.

**Conclusion:**
Pre-pregnancy obesity emerged as a significant risk factor for EGWG, with higher GWG observed in African and Pacific Islander populations and lower mean GWG among Asians. The study highlights the significance of ethnicity-based interventions and the limitations of applying generalized GWG guidelines across diverse populations. It calls for further research into genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors to refine IOM recommendations.

**Background and aims:**
In recent years, metformin has been increas- ingly used in the treatment of GDM. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments for GDM, such as metformin, insulin, or metformin in combination with insulin. Which of them is most effective in reducing the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes?

**Materials and methods:**
Screening for GDM was performed in 3116 pregnant women and revealed GDM in 252 women (75-g OGTT). All patients were divided into 3 groups (Gr.): Gr.1 - 84 patients, who treated with insulin, Gr.2 - 89 patients, who treated with metformin, Gr.3 - 79 patients, who treated with insulin + metformin.

**Results:**
At the start of treatment HbA1c (%) levels were for Gr.1, 2 and 3: 6.7 (0.01), 6.6 (0.05), 6.7(0.01) respectively; By term HbA1c levels decreased in all groups. The dose of insulin in Gr.1 (47.7±7.8) was significantly higher than in Gr. 3 (19.3±3.8, P=0.000). Weight gain was lower for women from Gr.2 (2.71±.18) and 3 (2.93± 2.67) compared to those from Gr.1. (4.14±3.65; P1-2=0.0019; P1-3=0.0174). The percentage of pre-eclampsia in Gr.1,2, and 3 was 3.57, 2.24, and 3.9, respectively. The incidence of preterm delivery before 37 weeks of gestation in Gr2 (3.37%) and 3 (3.79%) was lower, than in Gr.1 (3.5%) . The incidence perinatal mortality was in Gr.1 - 1.19%, Gr.2 - 2.24%, and Gr.3 - 1.26%. There was no statistical sig- nificance in pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery and perinatal mortality. In all groups, we observed a high percentage of Cesarean sections (Gr.1- 32.1, Gr.2-32.5, and Gr.3-31.6), but it was not statistically significant. In all groups, percent of macrosomia was high: Gr.1-29.7, Gr.2-17.9 and Gr.3-24.05). So, the risk of developing macrosomia in insulin group was 1.93 times higher than in metformin group (P=0.035) and this risk in Gr.1 is 1.33 times higher than in Gr.3 (insulin + met- formin), however, the result is not reliable (P-0.206). Percent of neo- natal hypoglycemia was lower in Gr.2 and 3 (1.12; 1.26), than in Gr.1 (2.38), and percent of respiratory distress syndrome was 3.57, 2.24 and 2.53 for Gr.1,2 and 3, respectively, with no statistical difference between the groups. In 2 weeks after delivery diagnosis of DM we observed: in Gr.1- 14.2%, Gr.2 - 5.6% and Gr.3 - 6.3%, with statisti- cal difference between the groups (Gr.1-2: OR-2.8, P=0.032; Gr.1-3: OR-2.4, P=0.005).

**Conclusion:**
While comparing metformin, insulin, or metformin in combination with insulin therapy, we observed that metformin and insulin are equally effective in the management of gestational diabetes and that metformin was linked to less maternal weight gain, lower insu- lin dose, and cases of macrosomia. The percentage of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, Cesarean sections, perinatal death, neonatal hypo- glycemia, and respiratory distress syndrome was similar for patients treated with metformin, insulin, or metformin in combination with insulin. In two weeks postpartum, percentage of patients who have dia- betes was lower in metformin group, than in patients who used insulin.

**Early gestational diabetes (EGDM) vs late gestational diabetes (LGDM): maternal and neonatal outcomes in a retrospective cohort**

H. Sagili

1. JIPMER, Puducherry, India, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, JIPMER,

**Background and aims:**
Early Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (EGDM) is a subject of ongoing debate and data regarding pregnancy outcomes in women with EGDM is inconclusive. The aim of this secondary analysis of data from a retrospective cohort was to compare the preg- nancy outcomes between Early and Late Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (LGDM).

**Materials and methods:**
This is a secondary analysis of the data from a retrospective observational cohort study in the Department of Obstet- rics and Gynecology of a tertiary care institute in South India. Data on women with GDM were merged from previous studies conducted from Jan 2017 to December 2023. 2401 women>18 years of age with singleton foetus and diagnosed as GDM with 75gram oral glucose tol- erance test using IADPSG criteria were included. Women with Type 1 / 2 Diabetes Mellitus and long-term steroid use were excluded. Details of the risk factors, including demographic characteristics, clinical fea- tures, and pregnancy outcomes, were recorded. The participants were divided into two groups: EGDM- < 24 weeks and LGDM- >24 weeks gestation. Statistical analysis was performed with Stat V14. Chi-square and Student’s t-test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The strength of the association was reported as a relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval. Adjusted RR (aRR) was calculated after adjusting for potential confounders(age, socioeconomic status, education, type of conception, family history of T2DM, BMI, type of GDM, Aspirin use). A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
Among 2401 participants, 482 (20.1%) had EGDM and 1919 (79.9%) had LGDM. EGDM women had a significantly higher mean maternal age (28.5 vs. 27.5 years, p<0.001), BMI ≥25 kg/m² (68.4% vs. 62%, p<0.001), fewer education years (11.9 vs. 12.2, p=0.015), and lower spontaneous conception rate (93.2% vs. 96.7%, p<0.001). Need for combined insulin and metformin therapy (12% vs. 3.2%, aRR: 2.19, 95%CI: 1.57-3.05, p<0.001), Metformin alone(35.9% vs 18.5%, aRR:1.85,95%CI:1.58-2.16, P<0.001), preterm birth (13.9% vs. 6.5%, aRR: 2.25, 95%CI: 1.69-3.01, p<0.001)and low birth weight babies (24.5% vs. 17.6%, aRR:1.35, 95%CI: 1.11-1.64, p=0.002) were sig- nificantly higher in women with EGDM relative to LGDM. However, premature rupture of membranes (13.7% vs. 32.2%, aRR: 0.57, 95%CI: 0.45-0.72, p<0.001), oligohydramnios (5.8% vs. 14%, aRR: 0.57, 95%CI: 0.39-0.82, p=0.003), poor adherence to intervention (9.5% vs. 15.2%, aRR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.53-0.95, p=0.023), poor glycaemic control (9.7% vs. 15.1%, aRR: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.55-0.96, p=0.027), caesarean delivery (27.2% vs. 30.9%, aRR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.68-0.94, p=0.008), macrosomia( 3.3% vs 8.3,aRR:0.46,95%CI:0.28-0.7 7, P<0.003), neo- natal jaundice( 3.5% vs 6.3%,aRR:0.61,95%CI:0.37-0.9, P=0.048), neonatal hypoglycaemia (10% vs. 18%, aRR: 0.64, 95%CI: 0.48-0.84, p=0.001) were significantly lower in EGDM compared to LGDM.

**Conclusion:**
Women with EGDM demonstrate significantly increased need for combined insulin and metformin therapy or metformin alone, preterm birth and low birth weight babies, despite better adherence to interventions and glycaemic control compared to those with LGDM. These findings highlight that EGDM is associated with adverse out- comes, thus emphasising the need for early intervention to optimise pregnancy outcomes.

**Comparison of pregnancy outcomes in women with diabetes diag- nosed during pregnancy receiving combination of insulin and met- formin vs insulin therapy alone: a prospective cohort study**

S. Tiwari

**Background and aims:**
Insulin is the recommended first-line pharma- cological agent for the treatment of Diabetes diagnosed during preg- nancy. Some women will require Metformin in addition for glycaemic control. There is a lack of consensus concerning the obstetric and peri- natal risks of this combination therapy for Diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy. This study was proposed to compare pregnancy outcomes in women with Diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy receiving com- bination therapy of Insulin and Metformin with that of Insulin alone.

**Materials and methods:**
This prospective cohort study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at a tertiary care hospital in South India over two years. 192 pregnant women >18 years of age with singleton foetus and diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy (75gm OGTT, IADPSG 2010 criteria) including both Gestational dia- betes mellitus (GDM) and Diabetes in pregnancy (DIP) on a combina- tion of Insulin and Metformin Therapy/ Insulin therapy alone receiv- ing regular + NPH Insulin were recruited to the study. Women with pregestational diabetes and long-term steroid use were excluded. The study subjects were stratified into two groups -combination Insulin and Metformin therapy (n=96) and Insulin monotherapy (n=96) and were followed until delivery. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and maternal and perinatal outcomes were recorded. Continuous variables were analyzed using mean ± SD or median (IQR) based on normality and categorical variables as proportions. Between-group comparisons were made using the Student’s t-test or Chi-square test, and relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for cat- egorical outcomes. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
A total of 192 pregnant women, including 94 with GDM and 2 with DIP in each group, were analysed. The mean age was 28±4.2 years. Age >35 years(8.3% vs 4.2%,p=0.05) and median dose of Insulin(34 IU vs 20 IU,p=0.01) were higher in the combination group in comparison with Insulin alone. Urinary tract infections(2.1% vs 7.3%, RR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.06-1.34), induction of labour (55.2% vs 61.5%, RR:0.91, 95%CI: 0.71-1.15) were less frequent, and there were higher rates of preterm labour (13.5% vs 7.3%, RR:1.86,95% CI: 0.77-4.45),meconium-stained liquor (15.6% vs 9.4% RR: 1.67, 95% CI: 0.77-3.62), babies 3.5-4kg (5.2% vs 11.5%, RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.87- 1.25) and neonatal jaundice(4.2% vs 1%, RR: 4, 95% CI: 0.46-35.13). ) in the combination group when compared to women on Insulin alone, but the differences were not statistically significant. One case of still- birth, shoulder dystocia and neonatal death each were observed in the insulin-alone group.

**Conclusion:**
Women with Diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy treated with a combination of Insulin and Metformin appear to have similar maternal and perinatal outcomes compared to those treated with Insulin alone. Future prospective studies with large sample sizes and long-term follow-up are required to understand better the pregnancy outcomes in women with Diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy on a combination of Insulin and Metformin when compared with Insulin alone.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is an increasingly common pregnancy complication associated with progression to postpartum prediabetes. To identify mechanisms and potential biomarkers related to insulin resistance and development of prediabetes, we compared the serum metabolite profile of women with GDM and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) during pregnancy and at the 5-year follow-up, examining their prediabetes trajectories.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed fasting serum samples from 458 pregnant women (GDM, N = 136; NGT, N = 322), partici- pating in the ongoing observational PREG study at the IDM site in Tübingen, Germany by using high-resolution NMR spectros- copy to quantify 38 metabolites and 112 lipoproteins. Anthropo- metric measures, including BMI, body fat, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results and HOMA-IR were recorded. At the 5-year follow-up, 137 women were re-evaluated (GDM, N = 86; NGT = 51). Associations between clinical parameters and metabolite con- centrations were analyzed using Spearman correlation and multiple regression analyses.

**Results:**
Thirty-three metabolites (22%) showed significant differ- ences between GDM and NGT women (p < 0.05, fold change >1.2, FDR-adjusted) during pregnancy. In particular, GDM was associ- ated with decreased absolute concentrations of LDL-3 subfractions and increased levels of several very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) subclasses and ketone bodies such as 3-hydroxybutyrate. Explora- tory analyses revealed that BMI, body fat, fasting glucose, HOMA- IR, and HbA1c were positively associated with VLDL subclasses during pregnancy, while LDL-3 subfractions were negatively cor- related. At the 5-year follow-up, 50% of postGDM women had pre- diabetes. Higher levels of ketone bodies during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk for prediabetes 5 years later. The concentrations of VLDL were elevated, while HDL subfractions were decreased in overweight/obese postGDM women compared to lean women.

**Conclusion:**
Lipid-associated metabolites and ketone bodies are related to measures of overweight/obesity and insulin resistance. We introduce new candidates associated with the progression of GDM to prediabetes. Further validation in larger, independent cohorts is needed to determine the clinical applicability of these metabolic signatures.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common metabolic disorders during pregnancy, closely associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. As a micro- biota modulator, dietary fiber promotes weight loss and improve long- term outcomes in type 2 diabetes but are untested in GDM. We aim to evaluate the effects of dietary fiber intervention on metabolism and inflammation in GDM patient, and to identify modulations of gut microbiota or metabolites of relevance.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 69 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM by OGTT at 24-28 weeks of gestation were randomized to the control (n=39, receiving standard diabetic diet guidance) or interven- tion (n=30, supplemented with 28.2g of dietary fiber daily in addition to diet guidance). The primary outcome was the assessment of change in fasting blood glucose (FBG) from baseline to 12 weeks. Stool sam- ples were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing of the microbiota and metabolomics. At delivery, we measured the body length, weight, and blood glucose of the newborns, and collected meconium.

**Results:**
The interventional group with a greater dietary intake in, but has lower levels of FBG , HbA1c, and mean glucose and insulin resist- ance index (HOMA-IR). Compared to the control group the levels of serum LPS and IL-18 were lower, and the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was higher in the interventional group. Additionally, the level of the gastrointestinal peptide hormone PYY was higher in the inter- ventional group , which controlled appetite and increase satiety, while no significant difference was observed in GLP-1 levels. We found the improvement by dietary fiber in GDM phenotypes corresponded with alterations in the structure and function of the gut microbiota, with a marked increase in the relative abundance of SCFA-producing genus (such as Anaerostipes and Fusicatenibacter) and a decrease in the abun- dance of the pro-inflammatory genus (such as Collinsella). Metabo- lomic analysis showed upregulation of multiple metabolic pathways in the interventional group, including amino acid metabolism and protein digestion and absorption. Spearman correlation analysis found that ASV74_Turicibacter was positively correlated with fasting blood glu- cose, while ASV178_Faecalibacterium was positively correlated with IL-10 and IL-6. For the neonatal gut microbiota, the β-diversity of the microbiota in the interventional group was higher. The relative abun- dance of ASV36_Anaerostipes, a beneficial genus capable of convert- ing inositol into SCFA, was significantly increased in the interventional group, while the relative abundance of the "obesity-associated" genus ASV115_Megamonas decreased. Similar changes were observed in the maternal microbiota. Combined analysis of maternal and offspring gut microbiota revealed that, beneficial genera such as ASV5_Bifidobac- terium_longum and ASV1_Blautia were transmitted from mothers to offspring at a higher rate in the interventional group.

**Conclusion:**
Dietary fiber supplementation effectively improves glu- cose metabolism and reduces the risk of pregnancy complications in GDM patients by reshaping gut microbiota structure and regulating metabolic function. Gut microbiota modulation during pregnancy may influence the establishment of offspring gut microbiota through verti- cal transmission, potentially providing long-term health protection for offspring.

**Background and aims:**
The diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) mainly focuses on large nerve fibers, however, small nerve fibers (SFs) are also affected. Perception threshold tracking (PTT), which targets SFs by restricting an electrical current to the epidermis, could constitute a method of SF function. Recently, our group showed that the current needed for SF-activation increased proportionally with DPN severity, possibly due to a low intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD). This study aims to test this hypothesis and validate PTT for detecting SF pathology in DPN.

**Materials and methods:**
Fifty-eight participants were included from an ongoing study on fracture risk and its link to neuropathy in type 2 diabetes. The following assessments were used as signs/symptoms of SF pathology: cold detection threshold (CDT), warm detection threshold (WDT), IENFD, and question 7 from Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire (MNSIq, temperature sensitivity). The participants were divided into 5 groups of SF pathology based on the Toronto consensus criteria and above-mentioned SF assessments: 1) no SF pathology (n=26); 2) subclinical SF pathology (n=9); 3) possible SF pathology (n=8); 4) probable SF pathology (n=0); and 5) confirmed SF pathology (n=15). PTT and skin biopsy were performed on the same site (10 cm above the ankle).

**Results:**
Multiple-group comparison showed differences in PTT-deter- mined rheobase (p=0.025). ROC analysis was performed including the no SF pathology group and the confirmed SF pathology group and obtained an area under the curve of 0.78 (95% CI:0.62; 0.94) with an optimal cut-off of 0.97mA, giving a 73% sensitivity and 70% specific- ity. The ROC analysis was limited by low power and possible selec- tion bias. Correlation analysis of the rheobase with other functional SF measures were weak-moderate (CDT: -0.38 (95% CI:-0.67;-0.08, p=0.009) and WDT: 0.41 (95% CI:0.13;0.62, p=0.005)). Correlation analysis of the rheobase with IENFD showed a moderate correlation (-0.51 (95% CI:-0.69;-0.26, p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
The findings of this study support the potential role of PTT in future assessments of SF pathology. PTT showed significant differences in multiple groups comparisons and ROC analysis further supported the abilities of PTT. Additionally, correlational analysis across all participants showed a moderate correlation between PTT and IENFD.

**Background and aims:**
With the aging population, frailty and sarco- penia have become significant concerns among patients with diabetes. However, diagnosing sarcopenia requires expensive equipment, limit- ing early detection. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be assessed using creatinine (eGFRcre) or cystatin C (eGFRcys). This study focuses on the eGFRcys/eGFRcre ratio as a simple method for estimating sarcopenia. Since eGFRcre is influenced by muscle mass and may be overestimated in sarcopenic patients, whereas eGFRcys is independent of muscle mass, a lower eGFRcys/eGFRcre ratio has been reported in sarcopenic individuals. The established cutoff values for suspected sarcopenia are 0.821 for men and 0.784 for women. We identified a sarcopenia-estimated group among patient with diabetes and evaluated their clinical characteristics, with a particular focus on diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN).

**Materials and methods:**
This study included 245 patients with diabe- tes (145 men, 100 women) who underwent eGFRcys/eGFRcre assess- ment at our institution between April 2020 and March 2023. Patients were classified into the Lower group (eGFRcys/eGFRcre below the cutoff) and the Normal group (above the cutoff). Among individuals aged ≥65 years, 42 patients were in the Lower group and 183 in the Normal group. Clinical characteristics, including glycemic control, insulin resistance markers, nutritional screening indices, lifestyle hab- its, and complications, were evaluated. DPN markers included Achilles tendon reflex, vibration perception, nerve conduction velocity (NCV), intraepidermal pain perception threshold (PINT), and coefficient of variation of R-R intervals (CVRR).

**Results:**
Significant differences were observed between the Lower and Normal groups in nutritional screening indices but not in glyce- mic control or insulin resistance markers. Regarding DPN, the Lower group exhibited significantly lower sensory NCV in the median (Lower: 40.6±7.3 m/s, Normal: 43.9±8.5, *), ulnar (Lower: 43.6±5.9, Normal: 46.5±5.0, *), and sural nerves (Lower: 43.1±6.1, Normal: 45.2±5.3, *). Motor NCV was also significantly reduced in the tibial nerve (Lower: 39.4±3.7, Normal: 41.5±4.4, *). Furthermore, the Lower group had higher PINT values (Lower: 0.39±0.2 mA, Normal: 0.32±0.2, *) and reduced vibration perception (Lower: 1.16±0.1, Normal: 1.10±0.2, *). There was no significant difference in CVRR.(*:p<0.05)

**Conclusion:**
The eGFRcys/eGFRcre ratio was validated as a potential marker for estimating sarcopenia in patients with diabetes. Addition- ally, a significant association between sarcopenia-estimated groups and DPN was identified. This suggests that neuromuscular dysfunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of sarcopenia.

**Background and aims:**
Neuropathy is a well-known and highly preva- lent complication of diabetes. Less known is central diabetic neuropa- thy which can be manifested as hearing, smell and taste impairment. The primary aim of our study was to analyze differences in hearing, smell and taste function between diabetic and non-diabetic popula- tions. The secondary objective was to analyze associations between symptoms of central and peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Study group consisted of 50 patients with diabetes (18 with type 1, 17 males) while control group consisted of 50 persons without diabetes, strictly matched regarding age, sex and COVID-19 history. In all study participants medical history was obtained, anthropometric measurements were assessed: body weight, height, waist circumference with BMI and waist-to-height ratio (WtHR) calculation, blood pressure was measured and venous blood samples were collected for laboratory tests. Directly before assessment of smell (threshold test), taste and hearing threshold (pure tone audiometry), capillary blood glucose was measured with a glucometer. Exclusively in diabetic patients urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) analysis and tests for peripheral diabetic neuropathy were performed.

**Results:**
Hearing impairment was present in a half of diabetic patients and in 26% persons from the control group, p=0.023. The hearing threshold was significantly higher in the study group (Figure). People with diabetes compared to the control group, had an insignificantly lower smell threshold: 7.19±1.97 vs 7.87±2.05, p=0.097. However, number of people below the 10th and 25th percentile of normative values for gender and age was significantly higher in subjects with diabetes (10 and 9, respectively) than in the control group (4 and 3), P=0.023. Taste did not differ significantly between the study and con- trol groups. Diabetic patients had also significantly larger waist circum- ference and higher WtHR, prevalence of hypertension, systolic blood pressure, FPG and eGFR, while lower total and LDL cholesterol. In the diabetic subgroup, a highly significant negative linear correlation was demonstrated between the hearing threshold and vibration sensation, a positive correlation between UACR and glucose and triglyceride levels, and a negative correlation between UACR and HDL-cholesterol level. Patients with neuropathy had significantly higher UACR compared to those without neuropathy: 38.16±88.29 mg/g vs. 9.17±10.21 mg/g, P=0.035.

**Conclusion:**
Our results confirmed the presence of central neuropathy, particularly noticeable in hearing tests in diabetic patients compared to the control group, and bidirectional correlations between central and peripheral neuropathy as well as correlation between UACR and neuropathy and metabolic parameters in the diabetic subgroup.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic peripheral neu- ropathy (DPN) has emerged as one of the most potent predictors of reduced quality of life in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Early detection is essential for avoiding or delaying DPN hazards. Early neural damage is typically misdiagnosed by nerve electrophysiologi- cal tests. Thus, there is an increased need for simple and specific biomarkers for nerve damage that reflect early DPN. Phosphorylated neurofilament-heavy chain protein (pNF-H) is the main structure of neural axons that is released from axons into the blood upon axonal injury, making it a biomarker of axonal damage. The aim of study was to investigate the use of serum pNF-H level as a biomarker for DPN in patients with T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Ninety age, gender and body mass index- matched participants were recruited from a specialized hospital. The study included 35 T2D patients with DPN (DPN group), 35 T2D patients without DPN (non-DPN group) and 20 nondiabetic healthy individuals (Control group). DPN was assessed by Neurological Symp- tomology score (NSS), Modified Neuropathy Disability score (NDS), Neurothesiometer and 10 g Monofilament. Clinical data and labora- tory parameters were collected. Serum pNF-H levels were measured via ELISA.

**Results:**
Serum pNF-H levels were significantly higher in both dia- betic groups versus control group (p<0.001), and in DPN group than in those without neuropathy (p<0.001). HbA1c, NSS and NDS were positively correlated with pNF-H in DPN group (p=0.01, <0.001 and <0.001, respectively). Age, diabetes duration, BMI, low density lipo- protein, fasting plasma glucose, NSS and NDS were positively corre- lated with pNF-H in non-DPN group (p= 0.003, 0.024, 0.041, 0.013, 0.011, <0.001 and <0.001, respectively). pNF-H was independently correlated with DPN. The cutoff value of serum pNF-H above which diabetic subjects were likely to develop DPN was 33.45 ng/dl.

**Conclusion:**
Serum pNF-H levels are significantly higher in diabetic subjects, specifically those with peripheral neuropathy. pNF-H could be a potential biomarker of DPN in patients with T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) has been identified as a valuable marker for polyneuropathy diagnosis; however, whether it can distinguish between individuals with and without neuropathic pain, remains unknown. Our aim was to examine the association of nerve abnormalities and neuropathic pain with cor- neal nerve measures (in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes).

**Materials and methods:**
We used cross-sectional observational data from The Maastricht Study, including 3,425 individuals (52% female, mean age 59 years; 15% with prediabetes and 19% with type 2 diabe- tes). The following corneal nerve measures were examined: corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), and corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL). Polyneuropathy was diag- nosed based on lower leg nerve conduction studies in 3 nerves and was categorized as normal, with minor abnormalities, with moderate abnormalities, or with severe abnormalities. Neuropathic pain was determined as DN4-interview-score ≥ 3. We used linear regression analysis.

**Results:**
Polyneuropathy severity (from absent to severe) was in par- ticipants with prediabetes positively associated with corneal measures, CNFD 7.306 (95% CI -1.48, 16.1) and CNBD 11.088 ( -1.26, 23.44). In contrast in participants with type 2 diabetes there was a negative association, CNFD -3.232 (95% CI -8.78, 2.31) and CNBD -4.042 (95% CI -12.57, 4.48). The presence of neuropathic pain was not asso- ciated with corneal measures in prediabetes (CNFL 0.644 95% CI -2.34, 3.63; CNFD -0.045 95% CI -0.23, 0.14; CNBD -0.151 95% CI -24,15, 23.85), while in type 2 diabetes a small negative association was seen for CNFD -2.556 (95% CI -11.8, 6.69) and CNBD -3.167 (95% CI -17.38, 11.04).

**Conclusion:**
The positive association between nerve abnormalities and corneal measures in pre-diabetes may reflect increased corneal fiber and branch density as a compensatory response to nerve degenera- tion. In contrast, in type 2 diabetes, corneal neurodegeneration was observed, with negative associations between nerve abnormalities, neuropathic pain and corneal nerve measures. Overall, CCM may help identify subgroups of individuals with neuropathic pain driven by dif- ferent underlying mechanisms.

**Risk factors for corneal nerve fiber loss in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes**

L. Liu

**Background and aims:**
Corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL), a sensitive biomarker for early detection of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), is influenced by dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism. This study aimed to identify key glucose and lipid metabolic factors affecting CNFL in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and evaluate their diagnostic utility in detecting CNFL abnormalities.

**Materials and methods:**
Corneal confocal microscopy was performed in 150 T2DM patients to quantify CNFL and nerve branch density. A subgroup of 80 patients underwent 3-day continuous glucose monitor- ing (CGM). Serum biomarkers including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), glycated albumin (GA), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and lipid profiles were analyzed. Daily glycemic variability was assessed through coef- ficient of variation (CV) stratified by monitoring days.

**Results:**
Multiple stepwise regression analysis identified HbA1c, day 3 glycemic CV (CV~day3~), and ApoB as independent predic- tors of CNFL reduction. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated the following diagnostic performance: HbA1c (AUC=0.649, 95% CI: 0.519-0.779; sensitivity=80.4%, specific- ity=45.8%, cutoff=7.55%), CV~day3~ (AUC=0.640, 95% CI: 0.508- 0.772; sensitivity=51.8%, specificity=79.2%, cutoff=27.205), and ApoB (AUC=0.643, 95% CI: 0.506-0.780; sensitivity=67.9%, specific- ity=58.3%, cutoff=0.855 g/L). The combination of these three param- eters showed enhanced diagnostic accuracy for abnormal CNFL.

**Conclusion:**
HbA1c, short-term glycemic variability (CV~day3~), and ApoB are independently associated with CNFL deterioration in T2DM. These biomarkers may serve as potential therapeutic targets for early intervention in DPN. Integrated assessment of glycemic control, lipid metabolism, and daily glucose fluctuations could improve risk stratifi- cation and preventive strategies for diabetic neuropathy.

**Altered expectation-driven modulation of pain perception in pain- ful diabetic neuropathy: an fMRI study**

S. Meftah, K. ­Teh, A. ­Anandhanarayanan, G. ­Sloan, M.S. ­Gonoo, I.D. ­Wilkinson, S. ­Tesfaye, D. ­Selvarajah

**Background and aims:**
Despite extensive research on painful dia- betic neuropathy (PDN), the impact of pain expectation on perception remains unclear. Prior information about pain can strongly influence sensory and affective processing, but the neural mechanisms underlying this effect in PDN are unknown. This study examines how predictive cues modulate pain perception in PDN by identifying key brain regions involved in expectation-driven pain processing.

**Materials and methods:**
Twenty-six participants with painful diabetic neu- ropathy (PDN) and 18 controls (7 healthy volunteers and 11 patients with diabetes without neuropathy) underwent fMRI scanning. Participants were conditioned to cues indicating high pain followed by high-intensity stimuli and low pain followed by low-intensity stimuli. Subsequently, cues were introduced to mislead participants by pairing high pain cues with medium- intensity stimuli and low pain cues with medium-intensity stimuli in a pseu- dorandomized order. Pain intensity ratings were collected post-stimulus. Brain imaging was performed using a 3T MRI scanner, with preprocessing including motion correction, spatial normalization, and smoothing.

**Results:**
Pain intensity ratings followed the expected pattern, with higher ratings for high-intensity stimuli (47°C) and lower ratings for low-inten- sity stimuli (38°C) across all groups. The combined healthy control and No DPN groups reported an average high intensity pain rating of 9.08 (S.D ±1.04) and low intensity pain rating of 1.76 (S.D ±1.21), while the PDN group reported slightly lower high intensity pain of 8.08 (S.D ±1.80) but similar low intensity ratings of 1.68 (S.D ±1.34). When a medium-intensity stimulus (42.5°C) was delivered following high or low pain cues, the combined healthy control and NoDPN group reported an average lower pain cue rating of 2.53 (S.D ±1.41) and higher pain cue rating of 5.01 (S.D ±2.06), while the PDN group reported an average lower pain cue rating of 2.21 (S.D ±1.77) and higher pain cue rating of 3.47 (S.D ±2.49). Compared to PDN, controls exhibited greater activa- tion in the primary somatosensory cortex (MNI -33 -21 70; z= 3.1, FDR- p<0.05) when pain stimuli matched predictive cues (high pain cue 47°C; low pain cue 38°C), suggesting enhanced sensory differentia- tion. However, when high pain cues were followed by a medium-intensity stimulus (42.5°C) instead of the expected high-intensity stimulus (47°C), controls showed increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (-30 16 30; z=3.7, FDR-p<0.05) and the anterior cingulate gyrus (12,12,33; z=3.7, FDR-p<0.05) compared to PDN, indicating stronger engagement in expectation-related pain modulation.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings suggest that pain expectation modulates heat-evoked brain responses differently in PDN. Healthy volunteers and those without DN showed greater sensory differentiation in the primary somatosensory cortex and stronger engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus when expectations were violated. In contrast, PDN patients showed blunted responses in these regions, indicating impaired expectation-driven pain modulation. These results highlight the role of anticipatory brain activity in pain perception and suggest altered top-down modulation in PDN.

3. Audiology, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark, Steno

**Background and aims:**
Hearing loss (HL) is a common yet overlooked complication in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), potentially linked to microvascular complications and inflammatory mechanisms. Although neuropathy, nephropathy, and chronic low-grade inflammation are established complications in T2DM, their contributions to HL, includ- ing possible sex-specific differences, remain unclear. This study aimed to assess associations between neuropathy, nephropathy, inflammation, and HL in individuals with T2DM, exploring potential sex differences.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied 4,245 subjects with T2DM from the Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2) cohort. HL was identified by ICD-10 codes. Neuropathy was assessed using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI ≥4), and nephropathy by urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR >30 mg/g). Circulating levels of inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6, hsCRP) were measured at enrolment. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between neuropathy, nephropathy, inflam- mation, and HL. The model was adjusted for age, sex, HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, BMI, smoking status, previous car- diovascular disease, and medication use (lipid-lowering, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive treatments). Additionally, the model included nephropathy and inflammatory markers when analyzing the associa- tion between neuropathy and HL, and vice versa.

**Results:**
Participants had a median age of 65.6 years (IQR 56.7-71.6), with 41.2% female. Those with HL were older (median age 71.0 vs. 64.7 years, p<0.001), predominantly male (71.2% vs. 57.3%, p<0.001), and had higher rates of smoking history (69.8% vs. 64.2%, p<0.001) and previous cardiovascular disease (39.8% vs. 26.4%, p<0.001). Neuropathy was sig- nificantly associated with HL (OR 1.84, 95% CI [1.42, 2.38], p<0.001), particularly stronger in women (OR 2.77, [1.82, 4.19], p<0.001) compared to men (OR 1.45, [1.04, 2.03], p<0.05; interaction p=0.018). No signifi- cant association was observed between nephropathy and HL (UACR≥30 mg/g vs. <30 mg/g: OR 1.19, 95% CI [0.92, 1.54], p=0.19). Elevated TNF-α levels (highest vs. lowest tertile) were significantly associated with HL (OR 1.40, [1.07, 1.82], p<0.05), while IL-6 and hsCRP showed no significant associations. The figure illustrates the probability of having HL according to age, sex, and the presence of neuropathy.

**Conclusion:**
In patients with T2DM, neuropathy and elevated TNF-α levels were independently associated with HL, with neuropathy show- ing a stronger association in women. No significant relationship was observed between nephropathy and HL.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic neuropathy is a prevalent chronic complication in people with diabetes, contributing to reduced qual- ity of life. Sudomotor dysfunction (SD), measured by SUDOSCAN based on feet’ electrochemical skin conductance (FESC), is an early manifestation of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). While hyper- glycemia is a key risk factor in DPN progression, emerging data suggest that certain continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics— especially time in range (TIR) and nocturnal TIR—may associate with DPN independently of traditional markers like HbA1c. This study aimed to assess the relationship between selected glucose con- trol and variability indicators and DPN prevalence.

**Materials and methods:**
The inclusion criteria were age 18-50 years and a confirmed T1DM diagnosis (positive autoantibodies) for at least 5 years. The exclusion criteria were infection, pregnancy, cardiovas- cular disease, and hypertension. We collected demographic and labo- ratory data, as well as CGM-derived glycaemic metrics using GlyCu- lator 3.0 (TIR, nocturnal TIR, HBGI, M100, J-index) from 30- and 90-day periods before DPN assessment. DPN status was determined by FESC (<60 μS) on SUDOSCAN (Impeto Medical, Paris, France).

**Results:**
A total of 116 individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) - (88 without neuropathy, 28 with neuropathy) were included, with a median age of 34.5 (24.7-41.1) years and diabetes duration of 14 (10-21) years; 56.9% were men. Individuals with DPN were older [42.3 (29.2-46.8) vs. 33.6 (24.4-39.5) years]. 30-day CGM metrics showed no significant differences between groups. However, those with DPN had significantly lower 90-day TIR (46.5 ± 18.6% vs. 54.5 ± 17.7%; p=0.046) and TITR [26.9 (19.6-30.9) vs. 31.6 (23.3-44.5); p=0.03], as well as higher HBGI [12.0 (9.2-14.7) vs. 9.0 (5.5-13.9); p=0.04], M100 [263.3 (235.1-294.5) vs. 223.0 (168.7-282.8); p=0.02], and J-index [72.6 (55.7-83.3) vs. 55.0 (36.7-77.4); p=0.02] compared to those without neuropathy. In multivariable analyses, TIR (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96, p=0.002) and TITR (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93, p<0.001) were negatively associated with DPN, whereas HBGI (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06-1.51, p=0.01), M100 (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, p=0.001), and J-index (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, p=0.02) were positively associated with DPN, all independent of HbA1c, age, and albumin-creatinine ratio.

**Conclusion:**
Spending more time within the target glycaemic range and lower glycaemic variability are associated with a reduced risk of sudomotor dysfunction.

**Background and aims:**
Circulating inflammatory markers may rep- resent diagnostic and prognostic tools of diabetic critical limb-threat- ening ischemia (CLTI), a severe vascular disease with high incidence of amputation and death. We previously showed that patients with dia- betes mellitus and CLTI bear a high frequency of natural killer cells (NKs). However, no study assessed the phenotype and function of NKs in the early stage of CLTI, characterized by neuropathy.

**Materials and methods:**
We enrolled 177 subjects sorted into 5 groups reflecting CLTI progression: 1) non-diabetic healthy controls (n=25), diabetic patients 2) without neurovascular complications (n=27), 3) with peripheral neuropathy (n=39), 4) with peripheral neuropathy and foot lesions (n=42), 5) with peripheral neuroischemia and foot lesions (n=44). We assessed the frequency of circulating B-, ­CD4 and ­CD8 T-cells, and total NKs, using a flow cytometry (FC)-based diag- nostic kit. In a subpopulation of donors with diabetic neuropathy (n=16) and controls (n=16), we investigated phenotype modulation and function of circulating NKs. We characterized the FACS-sorted circulating NKs’ secretome by antibody membrane arrays, and we tested its angiogenic potential in vitro and in vivo in Hirudo verbana.

**Results:**
Using age and sex-adjusted logistic multivariate models, we observed increased frequency of NKs in diabetic patients with neuropathy. Although the frequency of angiogenic NK subpopulation was similar between groups, functionally, NKs from patients with diabetic neuropathy showed impaired degranulation , and reduced angiogenic ability and . Neuropathic NKs showed downregulation of angiogenic factors (IL-8, PDGF-B) and upregulation of monocyte/macrophage migration factors, effectively recruiting macrophages .

**Conclusion:**
By a routine laboratory test, we showed a high NK fre- quency in patients with diabetes mellitus and peripheral neuropathy. Moreover, we show functional impairment of NKs in neuropathic patients. If confirmed in larger cohorts, detection of circulating dys- functional NKs could help in the early diagnosis of diabetic CLTI, a still-unmet clinical need.

**Background and aims:**
To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Radio Frequency Resonant Cavity therapy in patients with dia- betic lower extremity peripheral neuropathy and explore its mecha- nisms for improving neurological function.

**Materials and methods:**
A multicenter, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted, with 25 patients currently completing treatment (14 in the intervention group, 11 in the control group). The intervention group received 200 W continuous-mode annular radiofrequency electric field therapy for a total course of 8 weeks, while the control group used a sham stimulation device (acti- vated without electric field output). The Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS) served as the primary endpoint, and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO ) was the secondary endpoint.

**Results:**
After 8 weeks of intervention, the TCSS score in the inter- vention group decreased significantly compared to baseline (6.62 ± 4.073 vs. 4.15 ± 2.035, < 0.01), while no statistical differ- ence was observed in the control group (5.36 ± 3.776 vs. 5.73 ± 3.849, > 0.1). The between-group difference in TCSS improve- ment was statistically significant ( < 0.05). The secondary endpoint, TcPO , increased in the intervention group ( < 0.01) but showed no significant change in the control group ( > 0.1). No skin burns or other severe adverse events occurred in either group.

**Conclusion:**
Radio Frequency Resonant Cavity therapy safely and effectively improves symptoms of diabetic lower extremity neu- ropathy, significantly reducing TCSS scores and enhancing tissue oxygenation. Despite limitations due to the current sample size, the rigorous concealed randomization design and standardized protocol (200 W/25 minutes daily) provide a novel approach for non-invasive neuropathic treatment, though long-term efficacy requires further validation.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is one of the most common complications of diabetes worsened by obesity in the so-called ‘diabesity’. The multifactorial pathogenesis of DN involves hyperglyce- mia, lipid dysmetabolism, and inflammation. Increased pain perception, allodynia, and neuroinflammation are strongly interconnected into the progression of disease. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid mediator, and phenolic compounds have demonstrated different metabolic, anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. Their asso- ciation has been recently proven in counteracting diabetes and obesity, overlooking their efficacy against peripheral neuropathy. Our study aims to explore the ability of a formulation containing co-micronized PEA and the flavonoid rutin associated with the polyphenol hydroxytyrosol, named NORM3, to limit the metabolic alterations and related DN.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57Bl/6J mice were divided into 3 groups: a control group receiving standard chow diet; mice fed with HFD for 19 weeks; a HFD group administered NORM3 (PEA 10 mg/ kg/die-Rutin 2 mg/kg/die, HT 0,5 mg/kg/die ) from week 12 up to week 19, along with HFD. At the end of experimental time, oral glu- cose and insulin tolerance tests (OGTT and ITT), and pain behavioral tests were performed. After sacrifice, serum parameters were analyzed by ELISA assay, and neuroinflammation was evaluated by Western blot and Real-Time PCR analysis. Quantification of Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber (IENF) density has been conducted using immunohistochemistry. Finally, the modulation of microRNAs mainly involved in DN were measured by qPCR.

**Results:**
First, we demonstrated the effect of NORM3 in improv- ing the glucose dys-homeostasis induced by HFD as shown by OGTT and ITT, and by the HOMA-IR, as key systemic index of insulin resistance In the Von Frey test, untreated obese animals showed a lower pain threshold (indicative of allodynia), which was normalized by NORM3 treatment. Meanwhile, Randall-Sellito test, which measures general pain sensitivity (both mechanical and ther- mal), no significant differences were observed. Both results indicate NORM3 potential in restoring diabesity-related allodynia but not mechanical and thermal pain sensitivity. According with behavio- ral data, NORM3 treatment reduced neuroinflammation in the areas mainly responsible for processing pain signals, such as thalamus and prefrontal cortex, as demonstrated by the decreased mRNAs of IL1β, TNF-α, and IL6 in both tissues. Then, we showed that the treatment increased the relative density of IENFs in fingers and palms of HFD mice. Specifically, PGP9.5 and TUJ1 are two markers used to assess nerve density and regeneration. Finally, we observed that NORM3 differently modulated the levels of microRNAs associated with DN in the spinal cord of obese mice. miR-146a and miR-21are involved in both diabesity-driven meta- and neuroinflammation damage char- acteristic of DN.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, our findings suggest a potential thera- peutic application of NORM3 against DN, reducing diabesity-related allodynia and neuroinflammation, and restoring IENFs density and function, possibly modulating key miRNAs involved in metabolism and vascular function.

**Background and aims:**
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are increasingly used to treat obesity and type 2 diabe- tes. The GLP-1RA Semaglutide is linked to an increased prevelance of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), macular edema, and retinopathy, but peripheral neuropathy is unreported. Since dia- betic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (DLRPN) and com- mon peroneal neuropathy (CPN) are associated with weight loss, we examined their occurrence in GLP-1RA users.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective case-con- trolled study from April 28, 2005 (when the first GLP-1RA received FDA approval) to December 25, 2024. Patients diagnosed with DLRPN or CPN were analysed for GLP-1RA exposure and clinical characteristics. A control group, matched for age, sex, BMI, and diabetes status, was used to assess for an association with GLP-1RA use.

**Results:**
We identified 26 patients (27 episodes) with DLRPN, with median symptom onset 6 months (range: 3-35 months) after GLP-1RA initiation. At onset, their median HbA1c reduction was 2.4% (range: 1-8.5%) and the BMI decreased by 4 units (range: 1-15), reflecting 13.9% (range: 3.6-28.5%) weight loss. Among 77 patients with CPN (82 episodes), symptoms appeared on average 15 months (range: 1-112 months) after GLP-1RA initiation. In these patients median HbA1c reduction was 1.2% (range: -0.4-5%) and BMI decrease of 4 units (range: 0-15), corresponding to a 15.7% (range: 3.0-37.0%) weight loss. DLRPN individuals exhibited greater HbA1c reductions than CPN patients (2.4% vs. 1.2%, P<0.001). New NAION, macular edema, or retinopathy were not evident with GLP- 1RAs. Compared to controls, GLP-1RA users were 51% more likely to develop DLRPN (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.9, P=0.0008) and 30% more likely to develop CPN (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0-1.5, p=0.018). All cases occurred after 2015, with three DLRPN and seven CPN from 2015-2019, rising in 2020-2024 to 24 and 70 cases, reflecting increases of 700% and 900% respectively.

**Conclusion:**
GLP-1RA use is associated with increased risks of DLRPN and CPN. DLRPN appears more strongly linked improved glycaemic control, while CPN is more influenced by weight loss.

**Background and aims:**
There are currently no FDA approved dis- ease modifying therapies for Diabetic Neuropathy (DN). Reduced miR-146a-5p driven neuroinflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of DN. Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2i has shown benefit in diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy. This study investigated the effect of Dapagliflozin on corneal nerve morphology in relation to neuroin- flammatory pathways.

**Materials and methods:**
Forty-five subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) underwent corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) and assess- ment of serum levels of IL-1β, TNFα, Gasdermin-D & carboxymethyl lysine (CML) (ELISA) and gene expression of plasma miR-146a5p and PBMC expression of receptor for AGE(RAGE), NFkB, TRAF6, NLRP3 (RT-PCR) at baseline and 3 months after treatment with (n=25) or without (n=20) Dapagliflozin (10mg/day).

**Results:**
HbA1c decreased significantly in the Dapagliflozin (P=0.02) and non-Dapagliflozin (P=0.04) group. Corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD)[p<0.001] fiber length (CNFL)[p<0.05] and fractal dimension [p<0.01] increased and fiber width (CNFW) [p<0.001] decreased significantly in the Dapagliflozin group, while CNFL(p<0.05) reduced and CNFW(p<0.05) increased significantly in non-Dapagliflozin group. miR-146a-5p expression increased (̴ 2.5- fold) and serum levels of CML (P=0.03), IL-1β (P=0.01), TNFα (P=0.02), Gasdermin-D (P=0.02) and RAGE (P=0.01), TRAF6 (P=0.04), NFkB (P=0.03) and NLRP3(P=0.04) gene expression, decreased significantly in the dapagliflozin treated group compared to no change in the non-Dapagliflozin group.

**Conclusion:**
Dapagliflozin treatment was associated with early cor- neal nerve regeneration and modulation of the miR-146a5p/TRAF6/ NFkB pathway.

**Diabetic foot ulcer: value of bedside blind bone biopsy and bed- side toe amputation practiced by a diabetologist on major infe- rior limb amputation incidence**

F. Féron

**Background and aims:**
In case of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), major inferior limb amputation (MILA defined as complete transmetatarsal, transtibial, transfemoral) is closely related to underlying osteitis and necrosis. Since 2016, in our diabetology unit, medical physicians have been performing bedside blind bone biopsy (B4) and bedside toe amputation surgery (BAS).

**Materials and methods:**
In this monocentric, observational study, we compare rates of MILA in the operating room during 2015, the reference period wtih no B4 or BAS, to 2023.

**Results:**
In 2015 and 2023, 105 and 129 patients were respectively hospitalized for a DFU. Patients’ characteristics (age, sex ratio, dia- betes mellitus type and duration, DFU history, tobacco smoking, renal function) and DFU severity score (SINBAD) were not sig- nificantly different (except in the case of a higher HbA1c in 2015, p=0.0375). In 2023, B4 and BAS were respectively performed in 45% and 18%. Significantly more inferior distal limb revasculariza- tions were performed in 2023 (24 vs 49%, p=0.0001). MILA rate significantly decreased between 2015 and 2023 (21 vs 8.5%, -61%, p=0.0067). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, B4 but not BAS was associated with this result (figure 1). Revascularization seems a marker of a severe disease.

**Conclusion:**
In a diabetology unit, B4 improves prognosis by reduc- ing MILA rate. The lack of statistical power might explain the lack of benefit from BAS and/or revascularization. A long term analysis of B4/BAS/revascularization practice is required.

**The association between platelet morphological parameters and diabetic peripheral neuropathy in people with type 1 diabetes**

M. Kulecki, Anderko, B. Lasowski, P. Haras, A. Grzelka-Wozniak, A. Araszkie-, wicz, D. Zozulinska-Ziolkiewicz

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic neuropathy is a common complica- tion among individuals with diabetes, contributing to a reduced quality of life. One of its early markers is sudomotor dysfunction (SD), which can be quantified using SUDOSCAN based on feet’s electrochemical skin conductance (FESC). People with diabetes often exhibit increased mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW). Both MPV and PDW have been linked to various diabetic complica- tions, such as arterial stiffness and erectile dysfunction. Although an association between higher MPV and neuropathy has been described in people with type 2 diabetes, corresponding data in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) remain scarce. This study evaluated the relationship between platelet morphology parameters (MPV, PDW) and sudomotor dysfunc- tion in individuals with T1DM.

**Materials and methods:**
We enrolled 119 participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The inclusion criteria were age 18-50 years and a confirmed T1DM diagnosis (positive autoantibodies) for at least 5 years. Exclusion criteria included infection, pregnancy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, platelet counts, or hemoglobin outside the refer- ence range. Demographic and laboratory data were collected, includ- ing MPV and PDW measurements performed on a Sysmex XN1000 analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Japan) within 120 minutes of blood collection. SD was defined by FESC below 60 μS, measured with a SUDOSCAN device (Impeto Medical, Paris, France).

**Results:**
The median age of the participants was 34.0 [24.6-41.3] years, and the median duration of diabetes was 16 [10-23] years. In the study group, 59 (49.6%) were male. Sudomotor dysfunction (SD) was diag- nosed in 26 out of 119 participants (21.8%). Individuals with SD were older [42.6 (30.0-46.9) vs. 33.6 (24.4-39.7) years] and had higher MPV values but not PDW. Both MPV and PDW correlated with hand skin conductance but did not correlate significantly with FESC. In multi- variate models, adjusting for age, duration of diabetes, and HbA1c levels, both PDW (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.08-1.63; p=0.01) and MPV (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.23-3.73; p=0.01) were significantly associated with SD.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that elevated platelet morphol- ogy parameters, particularly MPV and PDW, may serve as essential correlates of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in T1DM, highlighting a potential role for platelet indices in early risk assessment.

**Background and aims:**
Small fibre neuropathy represents an early and often under-recognised complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key regulator of lipid metabolism, has been implicated in neurodegenera- tive processes through its involvement in inflammatory and vascular pathways. In this study, we evaluated corneal nerve morphology and circulating PCSK9 concentrations in individuals with T1DM in com- parison to age-matched healthy controls.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied 85 adults with T1DM and 87 age- matched healthy controls. Corneal nerve fibre density (NFD), nerve branch density (NBD), and nerve fibre length (NFL) were assessed using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). Total and free PCSK9 were quantified by ELISA. Multiple linear regression was used to examine associations between PCSK9 levels and nerve parameters, adjusting for age and diabetes duration.

**Results:**
Compared to controls, individuals with T1DM had signifi- cantly lower NFD (no./mm ) (24.38 ± 9.85 vs 36.23 ± 6.55), NBD (no./mm ) (52.81 ± 32.24 vs 88.27 ± 37.60), and NFL (mm/mm ) (18.18 ± 6.83 vs 25.96 ± 5.55) all p < 0.001. Total PCSK9 was sig- nificantly reduced in T1DM (193.26 ± 73.36 vs 272.45 ± 71.50 ng/ ml, p < 0.001), while free PCSK9 was elevated (144.69 ± 60.42 vs 107.10 ± 36.61 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Multivariable regression analyses, adjusted for age and duration of diabetes, demonstrated that both free and total PCSK9 levels were independently associated with reduced NFD (p = 0.038 and p = 0.031, respectively).

**Conclusion:**
These findings demonstrate significant small fibre nerve loss in T1DM and identify altered PCSK9 profiles—characterised by reduced total and elevated free PCSK9—as independent correlates of corneal nerve degeneration. PCSK9 may represent a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for diabetes-related small fibre neuropathy.

**Background and aims:**
People with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) have an increased risk of falls, potentially due to impaired postural control associated with diabetic neuropathy. This study aimed to investigate postural control in people with T2D, with and without neuropathy, by assessing the center of pressure (CoP) during quiet standing.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study included partici- pants aged 40 years and older with a diagnosis of T2D for at least one year. Participants were divided into two groups: Those with diabetic neuropathy (n = 49) and those without (n = 50). Diabetic neuropa- thy was defined as either a vibration perception threshold ≥ 50V, two or more abnormalities in the standard cardiac autonomic reflex tests (heart rate responses to deep breathing, to standing, and to the Vals- alva maneuver), or abnormal orthostatic blood pressure measurements. Postural control was assessed during quiet standing by measuring CoP area and velocity, higher values indicating diminished postural control, with eyes open and closed, while performing cognitive tasks. Data were analyzed using generalized linear models with gamma distribution and linear regression models, adjusting for covariates like age (<65 and ≥65), sex, body mass index (BMI), timed-up-and-go (TUG), chair stand test (CST) performance, and use of fall-associated medications.

**Results:**
The neuropathy group was older (mean age 66.8 vs. 60.8 years, p<0.001) and more likely to be male (75.5% vs. 52%, p=0.015). In unadjusted analyses, diabetic neuropathy was associated with signifi- cantly higher CoP (area: β = 0.62, p < 0.001 and velocity: β = 0.31, p = 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, TUG, CST performance, and use of fall-associated medications, diabetic neuropathy remained signif- icantly associated with a higher CoP area (β = 0.42, p = 0.029). Higher CST performance (i.e., more stands) was significantly associated with decreased CoP area (β = -0.07, p = 0.007), whereas slower mobility (higher TUG) was significantly associated with increased CoP velocity (β = 0.28, p = 0.036). Additionally, female sex was significantly associ- ated with reduced CoP velocity (β = -0.29, p = 0.002).

**Conclusion:**
These findings clearly demonstrate that diabetic neuropa- thy and reduced functional mobility contribute to impaired postural control and should be routinely evaluated in clinical practice to help mitigate fall risk in people with T2D.

**Diabetic peripheral neuropathy and associated microvascular com- plications in type 2 diabetes: insights from a Greater Manchester cohort**

M. Ahmed

**Background and aims:**
To determine the prevalence and clinical char- acteristics of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in patients with type 2 diabetes in a representative cohort from Greater Manchester.

**Materials and methods:**
408 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes attending diabetes clinics at two secondary centres were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of microvascular complications with a focus on neuropathy and related risk factors. Neuropathy was determined using neurothesiometer (>15V) and 10g monofilament exam.

**Results:**
Within this cohort (mean age 61.62 ± 13.3 years, 61% male), 34.8% of patients demonstrated evidence of large fibre neu- ropathy. Patients with DPN were older (64.09±11.4 vs 59.21±14.21 years, p=0.002) and had a longer duration of diabetes (18.06±8.98 vs 13.94±8.41 years, p<0.001) compared to people without DPN. There was no difference in any other known risk factors; BMI (31.03±7.09 vs 32.69±8.02,p=0.082), HbA1c (71.49±23.35 vs 70.71±20.6mmol/ mol, p=0.783), smoking (p=0.055), cholesterol (4.14±1.28 vs 4.18±1.24mmol/L, p=0.83), and triglycerides (2.42±2.56 vs 2.27±2.55 mmol/L, p=0.66).There was a 14.6% average increase in DPN prevalence for each subsequent five-year period. 68.5% with a diabetes duration >10 years had DPN. The prevalence of retinopathy and nephropathy were 34.5% and 42.1% in the first five-year group, increased to 50.9% and 45.1% in the 5-10-year group and 76.2% and 67.5% in >10-year group, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Study highlights the high prevalence of DPN and retinop- athy, notably, approximately one-third of patients were affected within the first 5 years of diagnosis. Early detected and targeted treatment strategies are critical for reducing burden of diabetes-related complica- tions, particularly in the early stages of type 2 diabetes.

Both obesity and autoimmune diabetes (AD) increase the risk of small fiber neuropathy (SFN). Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) allows the detection of early damage to small nerve fibers. Langerhans cells (LC), easily assessed by CCM, are professional antigen-presenting cells in the cornea and may be a potential mediator of neuronal damage. In this study, we evaluated whether the presence of overweight and obesity (OW/OB), insulin resistance, and inflam- matory markers might relate to CCM markers of nerve damage and inflammation in subjects with AD.

**Materials and methods:**
CCM was used to evaluate mature, immature, and total LC density (no/mm2), corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD) (no./mm2), branch density (CNBD) (no./mm2) and fiber length (CNFL) (mm/mm2) in 46 people with AD (20 normal weight [NW_AD] and 26 with OW/OB [OW/OB_AD]). Clinical (age, disease duration, body mass index - BMI) and biochemical (HbA1c, blood glucose, lipid, renal function) features were collected. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-α) were assessed with bead-based multiplexed immunoassay. Surrogate markers of insulin resistance, including tri- glyceride/HDL (Tg/HDL) ratio and Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI), were estimated.

**Results:**
Population features, stratified by presence of OW/OB, are summarized in Table 1. Subjects with OW/OB showed a higher number of mature LC than normal weight (p=0.049). CCM parameters did not significantly differ between NW_AD and OW/OB_AD. Among peo- ple with OW/OB, Tg/HDL ratio was negatively correlated to CNDB and CNFL (respectively, r=-0.455, p=0.022 and r=-0.505, p=0.010). VAI was also negatively associated with CNFL (r=-0.489, p=0.018). In the same group an inverse relationship was found between IL-1β and CNFD (r=-0.437, p=0.026), CNBD (r=-0.555, p=0.003), CNFL (r=-0.668, p<0.001). A positive correlation between IL-10 and CNBD was found (r=0.527, p=0.006). In the NW_AD group, immature and total LC were directly related to Tg/HDL ratio (r=0.544, p=0.016 and r=0.488, p=0.034, respectively). A trend was present for VAI (respec- tively, r=0.494, p=0.052 and r=0.456, p=0.076).

**Conclusion:**
Inflammatory cytokines and surrogate markers of insulin resistance may negatively impact on small nerve fibers in subjects with AD affected by OW/OB. These results strengthen the importance of investigating the effects of the increasing burden of OW/OB on the complications of AD.

**Background and aims:**
There is a major and imminent need for blood- based biomarkers to both identify the presence and inform the prog- nosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. This meta-analysis aimed to assess potential blood-based biomarkers in type 2 diabetes associated with peripheral neuropathy.

**Materials and methods:**
A data search of Ovid, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane library and Web of Science from inception to August 2024 was performed. Observational studies reporting a quantitative blood- based biomarker associated with nerve involvement in individuals with type 2 diabetes associated peripheral neuropathy were included. Exclu- sion criteria included studies where participants were aged younger than 18 years, those that included participants with a concomitant cen- tral nervous system disorder, and where there was no control group, or a comorbid control group with neuropathy. Case reports, and confer- ence abstracts were excluded. Data were extracted and reviewed by 2 investigators with conflicting results adjudicated by a third. The review was preregistered on PROSPERO and followed PRISMA reporting guidelines. Joanna Briggs Institute checklists were used to assess study quality. Meta-analysis was performed if two or more studies reported the same biomarker with comparable methodology. Fixed-effect models were used when only two studies were included, and random-effects models used when more than two studies were included. Prior to data extraction the main outcome measure was determined to be the associa- tion of abnormal blood-based biomarker levels with the presence of type 2 diabetes associated peripheral neuropathy.

**Results:**
The search identified 944 non-duplicate records, with 17 being included after eligibility assessment (one was removed from the metanalysis due to duplication of published data). Eleven different blood-based biomarkers were evaluated, with neurofilament light chain, evaluated in five studies. Nerve growth factor, neuron-specific eno- lase, S100B and brain derived nerve factor were each assessed in two studies. Individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy demonstrated higher levels of neurofilament light chain (SMD = 0.6 [95%CI, 0.30 to 0.96]; P=0.005) and lower levels of brain derived nerve factor (SMD = -1.67 [95%CI, -3.25 to -0.10]; P=0.0377) when compared to with those with type 2 diabetes, but without diabetic peripheral neuropathy. No differences in levels of S100B, neuron-specific enolase or nerve growth factor were identified.

**Conclusion:**
This meta-analysis supports the use of neurofilament light chain as a blood-based measure of neuronal injury in peripheral neuropathy associated with type 2 diabetes, while further studies are required to optimize diagnostic values for brain derived nerve factor and neurofilament light chain.

**Background and aims:**
Recent data suggests that the greatest rise in prevalence of diabetes has been across Africa. Diabetes related foot complications remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortal- ity imposing a heavy burden on the health care sector across the continent. Whilst several recent studies have focused on character- ising the foot ulcers in different African countries across different study periods, there is a scarcity of information on the demographics of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and their comparison across different settings during same timeframe. The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of DFU that are treated in different settings across African countries. The aim of the investigation is to investigate the demographics and baseline characteristics of people with active DFU who attended 10 foot clinics across Africa.

**Materials and methods:**
During the 6 months study period-October 2023 to March 2024 -data from 762 (F/M:297/465) patients with active DFU who attended the diabetes clinic across the 10 countries were recruited. The data included demographics, diabetes status, details of ulcer, amputation history, peripheral neuropathy, periph- eral arterial diseases (PAD), ulcer classification as well as the life- style and comorbidities. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the characteristics of patients at baseline.

**Results:**
The distribution of ulcers across SINBAD classifications were:SINBAD-1: 5.4%, SINBAD-2: 7.5%, SINBAD-3 14.2%, SIN- BAD-4: 34%, SINMBAD-5: 27.2% and SINBAD-6: 10.2%. There were 5.1% of patients with Charcot foot, and 3.4% had active ulcera- tion on the Charcot foot. Blisters was the most prevalent aetiology (32.2% of all wounds) followed by trauma (19.4%). 20.5 % of patients had history of amputation (3.1% major amputations, 17.6% minor amputations, and 0.2% both minor and major amputations) while 47.8% had a previously healed ulcer. 88% of patients had Periph- eral Neuropathy while 33.6% had peripheral arterial disease (PAD). 78.5% had a palpable pulse and 30.4% had neuro-ischemic ulcers.

**Conclusion:**
In this Pan African study, we have shown that almost 9 in 10 DFU were neuropathic with half of patients having a history of ulceration. 1 in 3 patients had PAD with a similar ratio having neuro-ischaemic ulcers. 70% of all ulcers had SINBAD classification scores 4 or higher.Our results show that neuropathy is still the com- monest cause of DFU. The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease is also high. The knowledge of patient characteristics at baseline can be useful in developing strategies to improve resource allocations across Africa.

**Background and aims:**
After retrospective analysis of our cohort of Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy (CNO) patients, we found an evident discrepancy between the clinical suspicion and the imaging confirma- tion through magnetic resonance (MRI) of activity in absence of inter- fering factors. We then speculated if an artificial intelligence-generated prediction model could help in guiding the diagnostic workup.

**Materials and methods:**
We retrospectively collected clinical and MRI data of all patients referred to our radiology Department with the clinical suspicion of an active CNO from January to December 2024. Clinically, we searched for the presence of oedema, erythema, pain and temperature difference between the two limbs in the plantar or dorsal region greater than one centigrade degree and the presence of a previous episode of active CNO. We distinguished patients into two Group according to MRI confirmation of active CNO through detection of bone marrow oedema (Group A) or not (Group B). We eventually created, using these clinical parameters, a decision trees model apply- ing the ensemble machine learning technique of the Random forest in regression modality with growing method Exhaustive Chi Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) which organizes probabili- ties in a tree-like hierarchical model.

**Results:**
We studied 40 patients. Diagnosis was confirmed by MRI in 15 patients of Group A (37.5%, mean age 66.1±9.6, median age 65.0, male/female 46.7/53.3%) and refuted in 25 patients of Group B (62.5%, mean age 70.2±8.0, median age 72.0, male/female 64.0/36.0%). CNO history was present in 44% of patients of Group A and 60% of Group B, pain in 44% in Group A and 53.3% in Group B, oedema in 44% in Group A and 80% in Group B, erythema in 16% in Group A and 46.7% in Group B. Plantar temperature was higher than 1°C in 72% of patients in Group A and 86.7% in Group B while dorsally the dif- ference was higher than 1°C in 56% in Group A and 73.3% in Group B. Only erythema (p=0.004) differed significantly between the two Groups. The decision tree pointed out a diagnostic model including, in hierarchical order: oedema (Chi square 4.972, p=0.026), erythema (Chi square 4.958, p=0.026), history of CNO (Chi square 3.884, p=0.049) and plantar temperature difference greater than 1°C (Chi square 9.000, p=0.003).

**Conclusion:**
According to exhaustive CHAID method, the sequence and the presence of oedema, erythema, history of CNO and plantar temperature difference greater than 1°C in this hierarchical order, rep- resent the clinical cluster of diagnostic signs more reliable in detecting active CNO.

**Background and aims:**
Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a prev- alent but often underappreciated complication among women living with diabetes mellitus (DM), influenced by both physiological and psychological factors. Despite its significant impact on quality of life, FSD remains under-researched in sub-Saharan Africa, particu- larly in Kenya. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of FSD among women living with diabetes in Kenya.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a multicenter prospective cross-sectional study between April 2024 and August 2024 at three public and private diabetes care clinics in Kenya. A total of 427 women were recruited and subjected to a validated female sexual function index (FSFI) questionnaire for sexual function assessment.

**Results:**
The mean age of our participants was 51 years among which majority attained higher education, married and living in urban areas and half of them were in menopausal period. 94% were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 40% of them were hypertensive. The prevalence of FSD was 75.8% using the FSFI threshold score of 26.55. The total median score was 21.0 (IQR = 11.5). All domains of FSFI scores were reduced compared to the cut-off. In the univariate analysis, age, level of education, living in urban area, the duration of marriage and the mean of diastolic blood pressure were signifi- cantly associated with FSD. However, in the multivariable analysis, only age and living in urban area remained significantly associated with FSD.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights a high prevalence of female sex- ual dysfunction (FSD) among women living with diabetes in Kenya, with multiple contributing factors including age, and urban resi- dence. Considering the significant impact of FSD, it is essential to enhance awareness, implement regular screening, and use integrated management strategies in diabetes treatment to improve the overall quality of life of these patients.

2. tal, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, Department of Cardiology,

**Background and aims:**
Previous studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency was associated with both cardiac autonomic dysfunction and the development of diabetic foot (DF). However, the impact of vitamin D levels on heart rate variability (HRV) in individuals with DF, a high-risk group, remains unclear. We explored the association between vitamin D status and HRV in individuals with DF.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 458 individuals with DF were assessed for vitamin D levels by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and evaluated for cardiovascular autonomic function using both time and frequency domains of the HRV measures. Multivariate regres- sion analysis and restricted cubic spline regression were employed to examine the associations.

**Results:**
Vitamin D levels were positively associated with HRV indices in people with DF, including standard deviation of the nor- mal sinus interval (SDNN), standard deviation of the 5-min average RR intervals (SDANN), low-frequency power (LF), high-frequency power (HF) and the LF/HF ratio (all P < 0.05). The associations between serum 25(OH)D and cardiac autonomic dysfunction were non-linear. When 25(OH)D levels were < 50 nmol/L, the odds ratio (OR) for predicted cardiac autonomic dysfunction per SD increase in 25(OH)D was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.44-0.72). However, no significant effect was observed when 25(OH)D levels exceeded 50 nmol/L.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates that lower 25(OH)D levels are associated with reduced HRV in individuals with DF. Specifi- cally, when 25(OH)D levels fall below 50 nmol/L, the risk of cardiac autonomic dysfunction in people with DF significantly increases.

**Improvement of small fibre peripher nerve function after two years of treatment with antidiabetic drugs and/or lifestyle mofification in prediabetes: the ePREDICE European trial**

R. Gabriel, J. ­Tuomilehto

1. Scientific Department, World Community of Prevention of Diabetes
2. Foundation, Madrid, Spain, Public Health, University of Helsinki,

**Background and aims:**
To date, there is not enough evidence as to whether the peripheral nerve function can be better preserved by com- bining lifestyle interventions with early glucose-lowering drug (GLD) treatment (combined or in monotherapy) in people with prediabetes. To compare the effect of glucose-lowering drugs (GLD) plus lifestyle modification with only lifestyle modification on the preservation of peripheral nerve conductance in prediabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in 875 adults with prediabetes (IGT, IFG or both) treated during 2 years. Six hundred fifty three participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to the glucose lowering drugs (GLD) group: metformin 850mg alone, linagliptin 5 mg alone or fixed-dose combination of metformin 850 mg/linagliptin 2.5 mg, and 222 to the matched-placebo control group. All study participants followed the same Lifestyle Modification (LSM) program of physical activity and diet recommendations. Sam- ple size and trial´s power were calculated to reject the null hypothesis with aggregate analysis of GLD against placebo. difference between baseline and 2 years in foot electrochemical skin conductance (FESC) measured with the SUDOSCAN® device. : High-risk of small fibre peripheral neuropathy (HR-SFPN) estimated as FESC<70 μSiemens. Using the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, we calculated the overall crude differences in the proportion of HR- SFPN between baseline and 2 years within each study group, and the Odds Ratio (OR) between GLD and placebo. In addition, the 2-year relative risk (RR) of SFPN in those participants with low-risk of SFPN at baseline, was also estimated in the 551 low-risk participants ran- domized to GLD, and the 195 individuals allocated to the placebo group.

**Results:**
The crude proportion of HR-SFPN at baseline (prevalence) in the GLD group was 15.6%, and 12.1% in the placebo (p=0.146). By 2 years, the crude proportion of HR-SFPN increased to 28.8% % in the placebo group, and to 26.3% in the GLD group (p=0.167). However, the baseline-adjusted increment in 2 years was 10.7% in the GLD, while 15,3% in the placebo group. Therefore, compared to placebo, the 2-year proportion of HR-SFPN in the in GLD group decreased by -4.6% (-9,9 ; 0.7); OR: 0.66 (0.43 ; 1.03); p=0.0523). Among those with low-risk of SFPN at baseline, 28.7% (34/118) evolved to HR-SFPN in the placebo group, and 30.5% (108/354) in the GLD in two years. RR 1.06 (0.82 ; 1.37).

**Conclusion:**
In people with prediabetes, the 2-year risk of SFPN decreased sligthly, but not significantly, with both metformin and/or linagliptin plus lifestyle modification or with lifestyle modification alone. Early intervention with glucose-lowering-drugs plus lifestyle modication can contribute to the preservetion of small fibre periph- eral nerve function in people with high-risk of peripheral neuropathy.

**Impact of vitamin B12 supplementation on electrochemical skin conductance in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy: a retrospective analysis**

A. Hinduja

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a major complication of diabetes, often exacerbated by Vitamin B12 deficiency, which is common in diabetics due to metformin use. Electrochemical skin conductance (ESC), a non-invasive marker of small fiber nerve function, correlates with neuropathy symptoms. This study evaluates whether Vitamin B12 supplementation improves ESC in well-controlled diabetic patients with neuropathy.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective analysis included 32 well- controlled diabetic patients (HbA1C 6.5-7.5%) with documented B12 deficiency (serum B12 <200 pg/mL). Patients received oral Vitamin B12 (1000 mcg/day) for 3 months. ESC was measured at baseline and follow-up using SUDOSCAN, which assesses sweat gland func- tion. Changes in Feet ESC (ΔFeet ESC) and Hand ESC (ΔHand ESC) were analyzed via paired t-tests (significance: p<0.05). Limi- tations include the small sample size, lack of a control group, and potential confounders.

**Results:**
- Feet ESC increased from 56.80 μS to 63.35 μS (Δ=+6.54 μS, p=0.031, 95% CI: 1.07-12.02). - Hand ESC increased from 50.80 μS to 57.47 μS (Δ=+6.64 μS, p=0.027, 95% CI: 1.42-11.86). - Patients with severe neuropathy (lower baseline ESC) showed greater improvement (exploratory analysis). - Age did not influence outcomes (p=0.26).

**Conclusion:**
Vitamin B12 supplementation significantly improved ESC, suggesting potential nerve function recovery in diabetic neu- ropathy. Clinical relevance of ~6.5 μS ESC changes warrants fur- ther study. Early B12 correction is recommended, particularly in metformin-treated patients. Study limitations include a retrospective design and a small sample size. Longitudinal trials are needed to confirm long-term benefits.

**Low-grade chronic inflammation and heart rate variability param- eters in internally displaced individuals with type 2 diabetes and subclinical cardiac neuropathy**

V. Serhiyenko

**Background and aims:**
Internally displaced persons (IDPs) exhibit emotional responses to psychosocial stress that disturb the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is asso- ciated with insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN). It significantly contributes to the regulation of low-grade chronic inflammation (LGCI). The objective of the study was to examine the differences in LGCI and short-term heart rate variability (HRV) among IDPs with T2DM and subclinical CAN.

**Materials and methods:**
Sixteen healthy individuals (group 1, con- trol) were examined alongside sixteen patients from Lviv diagnosed with T2DM and subclinical CAN (group 2), as well as sixteen IDPs also suffering from T2DM and subclinical CAN (group 3). There were no significant differences in age, sex, duration of T2DM, BMI, and HbA1c (p > 0.05). Subclinical CAN was detected using standard cardiovascular reflex tests and the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score-31 (COMPASS-31). We examined and evaluated the short-term HRV outcomes. Enzymatic assay techniques were employed to quantify immunoreactive insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 in the blood. The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and the ratio of TNF-α to IL-10 were calculated. Statis- tics: ANOVA. Statistical significance at p<0.05.

**Results:**
The persons with the highest HOMA-IR scores were IDPs with T2DM and subclinical CAN (5.2±1.7 [2.8; 8.1]; p<0.05). The examined individuals exhibited an elevation in hs-CRP, especially in group 3, with a mean of 9.9±4.9 [2.1; 18.7] mg/L (p<0.05). An eleva- tion in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and the TNF-α/IL-10 ratio was observed. The concentrations of TNF-α and the TNF-α/IL-10 ratio exhibited the greatest significant increases in IDPs (17±4.9 pg/ml [2.8; 21.6] (p<0.001) and 3.0±2.9 [0.2; 9.9] (p<0.05), respectively). In group 2, the heart rate (HR) of patients increased significantly, although the median RR intervals (mRR) and the percentage of consecutive NN intervals with a difference of more than 50 ms (pNN50%), high fre- quency power (HF) and the normalized high frequency unit (HFnorm) decreased. Compared to the second group among IDPs we noted a substantial increase in HR 86.19±82.3 [69.0; 121.0] bpm (p<0.05), of the normalized LF unit (LFnorm): 79.81±14.25 [54.0; 96.0] n.u. (p<0.001) with the decrease of root mean square of successive dif- ferences (RMSSD) 17.56±9.06 [5.0; 41.0] ms (p<0.05), pNN50% 2.56±4.66 [0; 17] % (p<0.05), HFnorm 20.19±14.25 [4.0; 46.0] n.u. (p<0.05) and the percentage of high frequency in the total spectrum (HF%) 10.44±8.15 [2.0; 26.0] (p<0.01).

**Conclusion:**
Internally displaced persons with T2DM and subclinical CAN demonstrate the most pronounced insulin resistance and a sig- nificant increase in certain LGCI indices. A reduction in total power and a pronounced preponderance of the sympathetic component were observed in IDPs with T2DM and subclinical CAN. The collected data can be used to develop successful strategies for preventing T2DM and innovative methods for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of individuals with this condition.

**Background and aims:**
Although they share common risk factors and overlapping pathogenic features, the relationship between cardiac auto- nomic neuropathy (CAN) and peripheral sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) in diabetes mellitus (DM) remains unclear due to the lack of prospective studies.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 276 individuals with diabetes (DM1: n=60, DM2: n=216) underwent baseline CAN assessments, including the 30:15 and E:I ratio tests and orthostatic blood pressure drop. DSPN was diagnosed using: i) clinical scales (NDS ≥6 or NSS ≥5 plus NDS ≥3), ii) sensory loss phenotype in the foot via quantitative sensory testing (QST), and iii) a combination of pathological electro- physiology findings and clinical deficits (Toronto consensus criteria). Participants without DSPN by each definition were followed for an average of three years. The impact of CAN (defined by ≥2 pathological cardiovascular tests) on the prospective DSPN diagnosis probability was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for multiple confounders (age, sex, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, DM type and duration, beta-blocker therapy, HbA1c, eGFR, and ACR).

**Results:**
A total of 51 individuals (18.5%) had ≥2 pathological CAN tests, while an additional 83 (30.1%) had a single pathological test. Apart from higher BMI and HbA1c in the CAN group, both groups were otherwise similar in basic clinical and laboratory characteristics. In cross-sectional analysis, ≥2 pathological CAN tests independently predicted somatic neuropathy across all three definitions: i) NSS/ NDS-based (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.04-4.31, p=0.039), ii) QST-based sensory loss phenotype (aOR 2.50, 95% CI 1.08-5.81, p=0.033), and iii) Toronto consensus-defined DSPN (aOR 2.90, 95% CI 1.23-6.82, p=0.015). In a longitudinal analysis of participants without DSPN by any of the three definitions (n=180), the presence of ≥2 abnormal CAN tests independently predicted the onset of somatic neuropathy over a mean follow-up of three years. This association was significant across all definitions: i) NSS/NDS-based (aHR 4.49, 95% CI 1.81-11.13, p=0.001), ii) QST-based sensory loss phenotype (aHR 2.86, 95% CI 1.04-7.90, p=0.042), and iii) Toronto consensus-defined DSPN (aHR 8.84, 95% CI 1.88-41.56, p=0.006).

**Conclusion:**
In individuals with diabetes without DSPN, cardiac autonomic dysfunction is a strong predictor of future DSPN develop- ment across multiple diagnostic criteria. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating CAN testing into clinical practice to identify patients at high risk for DSPN.

**Background and aims:**
Slow breathing and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback interventions have been explored as non-pharma- cological adjuvant therapies to improve autonomic function and overall health in individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. We aimed to systematically review the literature on these interventions in individuals with diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We searched 6 databases (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus) up to October ­9 2024, with no publication date restrictions. Eligible studies included RCTs, non-randomised controlled trials (NRCT), before-and- after time series, and case-control studies involving adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes undergoing slow breathing interventions (<10 breaths/minute) with or without HRV biofeedback, reporting diabetes- related outcomes. Exclusion criteria were studies in children, predia- betes, gestational diabetes, non-English language papers, unpublished/ inaccessible full texts, those without a comparator/control, and stud- ies combining slow breathing with other interventions such as yoga. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts; a third reviewer resolved conflicts. Data extraction included intervention details (type, duration, facilitator), population characteristics, compara- tor/control group, and diabetes-related outcomes. Methodological qual- ity was assessed using Cochrane and ROBINS-I risk of bias tools. Due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes, meta-analysis was not conducted; findings were summarized by narrative synthesis.

**Results:**
A systematic search identified 6,642 articles, of which 122 underwent full-text review. 14 studies met inclusion criteria: 7 NRCTs, 5 RCTs, and 2 before-and-after studies published between April 2011 and September 2024. These studies collectively involved 905 partici- pants across Israel (2), Netherlands (2), Finland (2), Bangladesh (1), Taiwan (1), Pakistan (1), Austria (1), India (1), Germany (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1). 2 studies evaluated patients with T1DM, 11 focused on T2DM, and 1 included both; participants were aged 31 through 89. Interventions ranged from single-session experiments (4) to programmes with long-term interventions and follow-up up to 16 weeks (10). 4 studies used in-person facilitators or self-guided prac- tice, 7 relied on specialised devices or software, and 3 did not specify their method. HRV, a marker of autonomic function, was assessed in 6 studies; 4 showed significant improvements in at least 1 HRV met- ric (p<0.05), suggesting short-term autonomic benefit. HbA1c was reported in 5 longitudinal interventions; 3 found no significant change, 1 showed a trend toward a decrease (p = 0.053), and 1 reported a significant decrease (p < 0.001), indicating limited glycaemic impact in this interval.

**Conclusion:**
Slow breathing and HRV biofeedback demonstrate poten- tial benefit for people living with diabetes but heterogeneity in study design, baseline demographics and measured outcomes limit gener- alisability. Future research should focus on standardising protocols, incorporating long-term follow-up, and assessing adherence to evaluate sustained effects.

**Background and aims:**
The commercialization of Automatic Insu- lin Delivery (AID) systems in Spain began in 2018. This prospective cohort study aimed to compare the incidence and prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using AID sys- tems versus those on multiple daily insulin injections (MDI).

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a prospective cohort study of 379 adults with T1D followed for a mean of 5.6 years (2018-2024). The presence of diabetes complications was assessed through a com- prehensive review of the patients’ medical history, physical examina- tion (including foot examination), and relevant complementary tests. Microalbuminuria was evaluated using a first-morning spot urine sam- ple. Additionally, the most recent ophthalmological examination was reviewed to confirm or rule out the presence of DR. Among the par- ticipants, 113 initiated AID between 2018 to 2024, and 266 continued MDI therapy. DR incidence was analysed using Cox regression and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE).

**Results:**
At baseline, AID users were younger (38 ± 13 vs. 42 ± 13 years, = 0.002) and had lower ­HbA levels (7.1 ± 0.9% vs. 7.4 ± 1.1%, P < 0.001). The reduction in ­HbA levels during follow-up was greater in the AID group (-0.20% -0.01%, = 0.023) compared with MDI group. The overall prevalence of DR at baseline was 13.98% (95% CI: 10.49-17.48%), with no significant difference between groups (15% in AID 13.5% in MDI, = 0.698). Over the follow-up period, the cumulative incidence of DR was 13.8% (45 new cases of DR). The inci- dence of DR was significantly lower in the AID group [6.3%, (95%CI: 1.41 to 11.09%)] compared to the MDI group [17.0%, (95%CI: 12.11 to 21.81%; = 0.011)]. Cox regression analysis identified significant determinants for DR incidence, including age [OR = 1.043, (95%CI: 1.012-1.075, = 0.005)] and ­HbA levels [OR = 1.433, 95% (CI: 1.004-2.045, P = 0.048)]. Conversely, a greater reduction in ­HbA dur- ing 5.6 years-follow-up was associated with a lower risk of DR [OR = 0.637, (95%CI: 0.429-0.947, = 0.026)].

**Conclusion:**
AID systems were associated with a significantly lower incidence of diabetic retinopathy compared with continued MDI ther- apy in adults with T1D over a mean follow-up of 5.6 years.

**Metformin eye drops improve early diabetic retinopathy in db/db mice through oxidative stress suppression and anti-inflammatory mechanisms**

X. Geng, Y. ­Qiu, X. ­Zhang, Y. ­Zhao, Z. ­Xu, Y. ­Yang

**Background and aims:**
The therapeutic potential of topical met- formin formulation in diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains unexplored. The present study explores the therapeutic efficacy of ophthalmic met- formin administration in modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the / mice model.

**Materials and methods:**
30 diabetic / mice received bilateral metformin eye drops (20 mM) or PBS twice daily for 14 days, with 15 non-diabetic C57BL/Ks mice as controls. Systemic parameters (body weight, blood glucose) were monitored longitudinally. Retinal histopathology was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain- ing, while apoptosis was quantified through TUNEL assay. Retinal oxidative stress status was evaluated by measuring glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels using commercial assay kits. Inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-6, TNF-α) was analyzed via RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) protein expression was determined by Western blot. Data analysis employed one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.

**Results:**
Topical metformin administration did not alter systemic parameters ( > 0.05). Metformin-treated retinas exhibited 1.36-fold greater inner retinal layer thickness versus diabetic controls ( < 0.05), with TUNEL-positive cells reduced by 1.48-fold ( < 0.001). Compared to non-diabetic mice, diabetic retinas showed significantly depleted antioxidant reserves (GSH: 3.2±0.4 . 6.1±0.5 nmol/mg; CAT: 12.3±1.2 24.5±2.1 U/mg; both <0.001) and elevated MDA (4.8±0.6 1.9±0.3 nmol/mg, <0.001). These were reversed by metformin (all < 0.01). Retinal IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA levels decreased by 3.8- and 4.2-fold respectively in metformin-treated mice versus diabetic mice ( < 0.01). Western blot analysis revealed signifi- cant downregulation of SELENBP1 expression in metformin-treated retinas ( < 0.01).

**Conclusion:**
Ophthalmic metformin formulation mitigates early DR progression in db/db mice by enhancing retinal antioxidant capacity, suppressing inflammatory mediators, and modulating SELENBP1 expression, independent of systemic glycemic effects.

**Background and aims:**
Treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) has grown increasingly essential, but consensus on effective methods for early or mild DME—characterized by best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT)—is lacking. Our previous studies suggest the potential efficacy of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in early-stage or less severe DME. This study conducts a post-hoc subgroup analysis of relatively mild cases to evalu- ate the feasibility of SGLT2i as a non-invasive treatment for early or mild DME.

**Materials and methods:**
This analysis, derived from the COMET Trial—a clinical study exploring SGLT2i’s impact on DME—focuses on cases with mild DME, defined by baseline CRT ≤375 μm and BCVA ≤0.155 (logMar). Patients in the COMET Trial were assigned to receive either the SGLT2i luseogliflozin or sulfonylurea (SU) as control, based on factors such as HbA1c, urinary albumin, and BCVA. All participants received an initial intravitreal ranibizumab injection (IVR), followed by additional IVR administrations every 4 weeks up to 48 weeks according to the protocol: 1) optical coher- ence tomography (OCT)-measured CRT>350 μm; 2) OCT-measured CRT increase by >100 μm from the reference CRT obtained post- enrolment; and 3) OCT-measured CRT increase relative to the previ- ous observation point, and BCVA increase by 0.2 (logMAR) from that obtained post-enrolment. In cases of bilateral DME, the more severely affected eye was selected as the study eye. Key outcomes included the frequency of anti-VEGF injections from week 4 to 48 compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with allocation adjustment factors as covariates.

**Results:**
For cases with CRT <375 μm, the SGLT2i group exhibited significantly fewer intravitreal injections (IVR) (0.5 ± 1.0) com- pared to the SU group (4.3 ± 0.8; p=0.005) (Figure). However, no significant differences were observed in groups with CRT ≥375 μm (SGLT2i: 5.9 ± 0.8, SU: 5.7 ± 0.8; p=0.80), BCVA <0.155 (SGLT2i: 3.5 ± 0.8, SU: 4.7 ± 1.1; p=0.36), or BCVA ≥0.155 (SGLT2i: 5.2 ± 0.9, SU: 5.8 ± 0.8; p=0.58).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrated a significant reduction in IVR frequency in the SGLT2i group among cases with CRT <375 μm and relatively mild DME. However, in the BCVA favorable group, which included cases with pronounced CRT thickening, no significant reduction in IVR was noted. These results suggest that incorporating SGLT2 inhibitors could be a valuable strategy for treating early-stage DME in cases with mild CRT.

**Early vs late vitrectomy for vitreoushaemorrhage associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy: a single-centre comparison**

Y. Li

**Background and aims:**
Vitreous hemorrhage secondary to prolifera- tive diabetic retinopathy is a common vitreoretinla condition with potential risk of permanent vision impairment. Currently, there is no consensus with regard to the optimal timing of interventions of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).

**Materials and methods:**
In this single-center observational study, we compared early (defined as PPV performed within 6 weeks) versus late (PPV performed over 6 weeks) PPV in 138 eyes from 65 diabetic patients who developed vitreous hemorrhage second- ary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy between October 2020 and March 2023. Main outcomes included 12-month postoperative best- corrected visual acuity (BCVA), re-operation rates, and severity of complications.

**Results:**
Data from 60 eyes with early PPV and 78 eyes with late PPV were compared. There were no significant differences in terms of patient age, sex and baseline BCVA between the 2 groups (all P > 0.05). However, the early PPV group had significantly better 12-month postoperative BCVA (P<0.001) and fewer post-operative complications (2/60 vs 12/78, P=0.02) than the late PPV group, especially those without posterior vitreous detachment. In addition, the re-operation rate in the early PPV group was significantly lower than that in the late PPV group (2/60 vs 10/78, P=0.04).

**Conclusion:**
Compared to late PPV, early PPV is associated with sig- nificantly better vision outcome, lower complication rate and lower re-operation rate for patients with vitreous hemorrhage secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

**Background and aims:**
Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothe- lial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents is a standard therapy for diabetic macular edema (DME). However, concerns remain about its systemic effects, particularly on renal function. Retrospective studies suggest a decline in renal function post-injection, but prospective data are lim- ited. This study evaluates the impact of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy on renal function in a prospective setting.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from the COMET Trial, a randomized, open-label study on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in type 2 diabetes patients with DME undergo- ing anti-VEGF therapy. Fifty-four patients were included, with a mean age of 63 years (range: 32-79) and a mean diabetes duration of 14 years (range: 6 months-40 years). Mean HbA1c was 7.70% (range: 6.5-10.9%), and mean BMI was 25.23 kg/m² (range: 18.8-33.9 kg/m²). Renal function was assessed via estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline, 4, 12, 24, and 48 weeks, and urinary albumin-cre- atinine ratio (UACR) at baseline, 24, and 48 weeks. Statistical analyses examined changes in renal parameters and associations with anti-VEGF injection frequency.

**Results:**
At 4 weeks, mean eGFR declined significantly from 72.09 to 68.57 mL/min/1.73 m² (p=0.001), with this decline persisting at 12, 24, and 48 weeks. However, UACR showed no significant increase at 24 or 48 weeks. No significant correlation was found between eGFR decline and the number of anti-VEGF injections. Patients on SGLT2 inhibitors showed a trend toward preserved renal function compared to those on sulfonylureas, though not statistically significant.

**Conclusion:**
eGFR declined early after initiating intravitreal anti- VEGF injections in DME patients and remained reduced through 48 weeks. The lack of correlation with injection frequency suggests the decline may result from chronic diabetic microvascular complications rather than direct nephrotoxicity. Unlike anti-VEGF therapies for malig- nancies, no significant UACR increase was observed. The potential renal protective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors warrants further investiga- tion. These findings emphasize the need for renal function monitoring in patients receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.

3. Spain, Diabetes and Metabolism Research Unit, Vall d’Hebron

**Background and aims:**
Neurodegeneration is a common pathogenic element for the development of two leading causes of severe visual impairment and blindness worldwide: diabetic retinal disease (DRD) and glaucoma. In addition, glaucoma is more prevalent in subjects with diabetes. In previous studies we demonstrated in db/db mice that topi- cal administration of sitagliptin (a DPP-IV inhibitor) reach the retina by transscleral route and exert a powerful neuroprotective action, which was coupled to an inhibition of vascular leakage. Since glaucoma is characterized by progressive degeneration of optic nerve axons and the retrograde death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), we wanted to further explore the neuroprotective action of eye drops of sitagliptin in an experimental model of glaucoma. This approach allows us to demonstrate whether the neuroprotective action of sitagliptin can be also observed in other retinal neurodegenerative diseases unrelated to diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
The DBA/2J mouse strain, a genetic model of glaucoma that closely resembles hereditary open-angle glaucoma in humans, was used. Sitagliptin eye drops (10 mg/mL; n=10) or vehicle (n=10) were administered for 3 weeks prior to euthanasia. An untreated group (n=20) served as control. Body weight and IOP levels were monitored throughout the study. Post-euthanasia analyses included RT- qPCR, western blotting, and immunolabelling to assess the effects of sitagliptin treatment in retinal sections, whole mounts, and the optic nerve head (ONH). Neuroinflammatory markers (i.e. RBPMS, TUJ1, Iba-1, γ-synuclein, galectin-3, JNK signaling, and NLRP3 inflamma- some activation) were evaluated by immunofluorescence. Oxidative DNA/RNA damage was assessed through 8-hydroxyguanosine and nitrotyrosine protein levels. In addition, oligodendrocytes (OLs) were assessed using Olig2 in the ONH, and synaptic dysfunction was also evaluated.

**Results:**
DBA/2J mice exhibited glaucomatous neurodegeneration with progressive IOP elevation and RGC loss by 43 weeks. A significant reduction in RGCs (axons and soma) density was observed, which was prevented by sitagliptin treatment. RGC degeneration was also associ- ated with a decrease in γ-synuclein expression in RGC axons which was inhibited by sitagliptin eye drops. In addition, sitagliptin treatment suppressed proinflammatory cytokine expression, microglial activation, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, JNK phosphorylation and preserved the expression of key synaptic proteins (i.e. SNAP-25, synaptotagmin, and VAMP2) in pre-synaptic neurons, and PSD95 in post-synaptic neurons. Additionally, it mitigated oxidative stress, enhanced Sigma-1R (S1R) activation, and reduced DNA/RNA oxidative damage (8-hydrox- yguanosine and nitrotyrosine levels) in the neuroretina and ONH.

**Conclusion:**
Topical administration of sitagliptin eye drops exert a multi-pathway neuroprotective effect in a genetic model of glaucoma. Overall, this result reinforces the concept that sitagliptin has a powerful neuroprotective action, which is unrelated to its antidiabetic activity, and can be contemplated as new therapeutic strategy for glaucoma and other retinal neurodegenerative diseases.

**Background and aims:**
This study aimed to investigate the association between the postload-fasting gap and risk of developing vascular com- plications, including stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), retinopathy and nephropathy, in a population-based cohort.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 2,071 participants from the SENSI- BLE cohort study were included in the analysis. We recorded incident stroke, CHD, retinopathy and nephropathy events over an average of 728.2 days of follow-up. The postload-fasting gap, defined as 2-hour postload plasma glucose (2hPG) minus fasting plasma glucose (FPG), was divided into quartiles (Q1-Q4), and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine its association with incident vascular complications. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to model the dose-response relationship and test for non-linearity.

**Results:**
In this cohort study, 110 (5.31%) of 2,071 participants had one or more new vascular complications events (including stroke, coro- nary heart disease, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic nephropathy). Compared to participants with vascular complications, those with- out vascular complications were younger and had lower BMI, blood pressure (both SBP and DBP), HDL-C levels, lower 2hPG, a smaller postload-fasting gap and were more likely to be in the NGT state (all p < 0.05). The risk of vascular complications increased across quartiles, with Q4 showing a significantly higher hazard ratio (HR) compared to Q1. Optimal cutoff values of what? identified through RCS analysis for increased risk were: overall vascular complications (1.55 mmol/L), stroke (1.62 mmol/L), CHD (-1.39 mmol/L and 1.62 mmol/L), retin- opathy (0.91 mmol/L and 2.5 mmol/L), and nephropathy (0.6 mmol/L). Nonlinear relationships were observed between the postload-fasting gap and specific vascular complications. A J-shaped association was found for overall vascular complications, a wave-like pattern for stroke, a U-shaped relationship for CHD, and an inverted U-shaped relation- ship for retinopathy. For nephropathy, a monotonically increasing association was observed, with risk rising as the postload-fasting gap increased. These associations remained consistent after adjusting for covariates.

**Conclusion:**
The postload-fasting gap can be an important predictor of vascular complications, with distinct nonlinear dose-response patterns observed for different conditions. These findings highlight the impor- tance of considering the postload-fasting gap in glucose metabolism assessments and risk stratification for vascular complications.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes is the most common cause of vision deterioration and subsequent vision loss in people worldwide. RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) is a signal transduction receptor, whose activation triggers an increase in proinflammatory mol- ecules, oxidative stressors and cytokines. Diaph1, protein diaphanous homolog 1, belongs to the Rho-GTPase formins and binds to RAGE’s cytoplasmic tail. Together these two proteins play a primary role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its related complications. Here, we aimed to gain insight into the effect of RAGE-Diaph1 signaling on selected protein expression patterns in retina and optic nerve affected by long- term hyperglycemia.

**Materials and methods:**
C57BL/6 (wild type, WT, n=14) and RAGE- Diaph1 double knockout (DRKO, n=14) mice were used in the study. Mice were randomly divided into control and diabetic groups and dia- betes was induced with Streptozotocin at two months of age as per earlier studies. Weight and glucose levels were monitored regularly. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee (no. 66/2024). After four months of the experiment, mice were humanely euthanized, and retina and optic nerve were collected for further analysis. Gene expression levels were measured by real-time PCR and subsequent analysis of obtained data was performed using GraphPad prism sta- tistical software.

**Results:**
Our results revealed increased expression of AGER (RAGE encoding gene) in both retina and optic nerve of WT diabetic mice as compared to controls over four months of the disease duration. Simi- larly, we also noted higher levels of RhoA, ACTB (actin encoding gene) and PFN1 (profilin encoding gene) in retina and optic nerve of WT, but lower in DRKO diabetic mice over four months of the disease duration. Strikingly, levels of DIAPH1 were lower in WT mice as com- pared to controls over four months of the disease duration.

**Conclusion:**
The novelty of our current study lies in the selection of proteins involved in RAGE-Diaph1 signaling axis and elucidation of their expression patterns in diabetic eye samples. We observed that the expression of RhoA, a part of RAGE-Diaph1 axis was increased in WT mice mimicking elevated levels of RAGE observed in diabetic sam- ples, however it was lower in DRKO mice highlighting the therapeutic potential for RAGE-Diaph1 signaling inhibition in diabetes. Similarly, ACTB and PFN1 were increased in WT diabetic mice, but remained indistinguishable from control in diabetic samples from DRKO mice. Finally, Diaph1 expression, as observed in our previous studies in diabetic peripheral nerve was reduced in diabetic samples, the down- regulation potentially offset by the observed upregulation of ACTB and PFN1 in WT samples. Summarizing, our results underline the importance of studying RAGE-Diaph1 signaling pathways in context of neuro-ophthalmic complications of diabetes, highlighting the therapeu- tic potential for RAGE-Diaph1 signaling inhibition. A follow-up study using RAGE-Diaph1 pharmaceutical inhibitor is currently underway.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in individuals with diabetes, yet adherence to lifestyle and therapeutic interventions remains suboptimal. We hypothesized that real-time visualization of retinal images during routine diabetes consul- tations could serve as a motivational tool for patients to improve glyce- mic control and adherence to lifestyle modifications. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of in-office fundus imaging on patient motivation, dietary compliance, and subsequent improvements in HbA1c levels.

**Materials and methods:**
A cohort of 70 adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) was included in this study (39 men, 31 women; mean age: 42.5 years, range: 21-71 years). The mean diabetes duration was 17.4 years (range: 2-47 years), and the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.6% (range: 4.8-12.1%). Fundus images were captured using a non-mydri- atic DRSplus® camera (iCare, Finland) with TrueColor Confocal tech- nology and analyzed via iCare RETCAD software (Class IIa certified). The artificial intelligence-based software was used to detect DR and age-related macular degeneration. Retinal images were reviewed with patients, emphasizing retinal health status and potential DR progres- sion. Motivational counseling was provided based on retinal findings, highlighting the role of glycemic control, dietary habits, and physi- cal activity in preventing further damage. HbA1c and Time in Range (TIR) from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Patient-reported motivation and adherence to lifestyle changes were evaluated using structured questionnaires.

**Results:**
Diabetic retinopathy of varying severity was diagnosed in 28 patients (40%). At baseline, patients with DR had significantly higher HbA1c levels (8.9% ± 1.2%, 95% CI: 8.45-9.35) compared to those without DR (6.7% ± 1.0%, 95% CI: 6.37-7.03, < 0.001). Diabetes duration was also significantly longer in the DR group (15 ± 4.2 years vs. 7 ± 3.8 years, = 0.002). Patients who visualized their retinal images demonstrated a significant increase in motivation scores and adherence to dietary modifications. In the DR group, the ability to see retinal images during the consultation led to a mean HbA1c reduction from 8.9% to 8.1% after four months ( = 0.015). A moderate negative correlation was observed between motivation improvement and HbA1c reduction ( = -0.42, = 0.002). The most significant improvements were observed in patients with early-stage DR, suggesting a strong preventive effect of retinal visualization.

**Conclusion:**
In-office fundus imaging and real-time retinal visualiza- tion enhance patient engagement in diabetes self-management, leading to measurable improvements in glycemic control. The ability to directly observe retinal health status appears to be a strong motivational factor, particularly in patients diagnosed with DR. Integrating this approach into routine diabetes care may serve as a cost-effective strategy to improve long-term metabolic outcomes and reduce the burden of DR. Further large-scale studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

We included all relevant studies, indexed in PubMed and Scopus, up to January 2025. A total of 29 studies (7,007 subjects) were included, and the results were synthesized according to PRISMA Guidelines. Results are presented as standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

**Results:**
The mean age of the included subjects was 52.6 ± 9.4 years, with the 52.5% being male sex. The primary analysis included 25 stud- ies with a total of 6,291 subjects (2,770 patients with DR vs. 3,521 controls). Notably, Lp(a) levels were significantly higher in patients with DR compared to controls with a SMD of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.48-1.22; p<0.001, ­I = 98%). Sensitivity analysis confirmed these results after excluding 8 outlier studies, that reported a pooled SMD of 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.39; p<0.001, ­I =72%). Interestingly, secondary analysis between patients with Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) and Non-pro- liferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR), reported a SMD of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.09-0.47; p=0.004, ­I =97%) between the two compared groups. In this analysis, a total of 1,066 patients (465 PDR patients vs. 601 NPDR patients) were included. Sensitivity analysis also confirmed these results with an SMD of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.09-0.47; p=0.004, ­I 28%).

**Conclusion:**
Elevated Lp(a) levels show to have a compelling eviden- tial relationship with the development and progression of DR.

**Association of protein-derived toxic molecules and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule with central macular thickness in diabetic retinopathy**

S. Pramanik

**Background and aims:**
Despite significant advances in treatment, the prevalence of blindness related to diabetic retinopathy (DR) continues to rise rapidly. Oxidative stress is a key driver of DR, facilitating the formation of protein-derived toxic components such as Protein Car- bonylation (PCO) and Advanced Oxidative Protein Products (AOPP), while also exacerbating inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, which are associated with the release of soluble Vascular Cell Adhe- sion Molecule (sVCAM). In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association between protein-derived toxic molecules and sVCAM with retinal morphological changes, specifically alterations in macular thickness, in the early stages of DR.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study included 87 age- and gender-matched T2DM subjects without DR (DWR) and 138 subjects with mild to moderate form of DR (NPDR) without macular edema, recruited from the ‘Retina Clinic’ at the ‘Regional Institute of Ophthal- mology’, Kolkata, India. The central macular thickness (CMT) of each study subject was measured using Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT). Fasting venous blood (5 mL) was collected from each participant, and serum samples were isolated. Vitreous samples were obtained from 9 DWR subjects out of 87 and 14 NPDR subjects out of 138 during 3-port pars plana vitrectomy for idiopathic macular hole surgery. Serum and vitreous samples were analyzed for PCO and AOPP using spectrophotometry, while sVCAM levels were measured by ELISA.

**Results:**
The Mann-Whitney U test was performed, revealing that PCO (45.30 ± 9.14 nM/mg protein vs. 68.67 ± 7.46 nM/mg protein), AOPP (106.9 ± 9.678 μM/mg protein vs. 142.7±13.53 μM/mg protein), and sVCAM (685.2 ± 19.50 ng/ml vs. 714.2 ± 29.91 ng/ml) in serum were significantly higher (all at p < 0.0001) in NPDR compared to DWR. Additionally, PCO (nM/mg protein) (28.96±4.74 vs. 52.48±7.18), AOPP (μM/mg protein) (71.39 ±6.81 vs. 104.1±9.26), and sVCAM (ng/ml) (369.7 ± 42.32 vs. 432.2±23.95) in the vitreous exhibited a similar trend (all at p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the NPDR subjects exhibited a significantly higher CMT (248.8 ± 12.31 μm) compared to DWR (237.2 ± 14.92 μm), with a p-value < 0.0001. Serum levels of PCO (r=0.68), AOPP (r=0.58), and sVCAM (r=0.79) correlated significantly (all at p < 0.0001) with their vitreous levels in the NPDR group. Furthermore, multiple linear regression analysis showed that PCO (p < 0.0001), AOPP (p = 0.0002), and sVCAM (p < 0.0001) were significant predictors of CMT in NPDR, with the model explaining 85.5% of the variation in CMT.

**Conclusion:**
The association between serum and vitreous levels of PCO, AOPP, and sVCAM in NPDR suggests systemic oxidative stress (SOS) and inflammatory responses, which may extend to the vitreous, an adjacent part of the retina. These processes may affect the macula and serve as predictors of CMT.

**Background and aims:**
Rapidly progressive diabetic retinopathy (RPDR) is a severe complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D), character- ized by extensive neovascularization, a high risk of intraocular hemor- rhages, and potential vision-threatening complications. This study aims to compare the 12-year evolution of glycemic control and complica- tions between patients with PDR and those without severe diabetic retinopathy at baseline.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective, case-control, multicentric, non-interventional study was conducted on adult patients with T1D. Participants were divided into two groups: one including patients with RPDR at baseline (N=33) and the other comprising patients without severe diabetic retinopathy at the start of the follow-up (N=66). The groups were matched based on sex, age, diabetes duration, and total follow-up duration. Glycemic control was assessed using HbA1c levels, while associated complications included nephropathy, neuropathy, foot complications, and cardiovascular events. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney test, and categorical variables were compared using Fisher’s exact test.

**Results:**
A total of 33 cases and 66 controls were included, with no differences in age (mean 28 years), sex distribution (69.7% women), or diabetes duration (mean 16.7 years) at baseline. However, hypertension was more prevalent in RPDR patients, with a rate of 36.36% compared to 1.52% in controls. Active smoking was also more frequent in this group, with 21.21% of RPDR patients being smokers compared to 36.36% in the control group. At baseline, median HbA1c was significantly higher in patients with RPDR, 9.7% [IQR 4] vs 8% [IQR 1.1] in controls (p<0.05). After a median follow-up of 11 years, cases showed a greater HbA1c reduction than controls and now have better glycemic control (median HbA1c 7.0 [1.8] vs. 7.5 [1.3], p=0.07). At baseline, eGFR and albumi- nuria stages were similar between groups. After follow-up, renal function worsened more in PDR cases, with 7 requiring kidney transplants and 4 on dialysis, compared to none in controls (p<0.001). After follow-up, diabetic neuropathy was more prevalent in RPDR patients (27.27% vs. 1.52%, p<0.001), and 3.03% of PDR patients experienced foot compli- cations, including amputation, compared to none in controls. No differ- ences were observed in macroangiopathy, although the low number of events over 12 years limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, despite improved glycemic control over 12 years, patients with rapidly progressive diabetic retinopathy (RPDR) at baseline experienced more severe long-term complications, particu- larly in renal and neurological outcomes, highlighting the concept of metabolic memory. These findings emphasize the importance of early and sustained management of glycemic control in preventing long-term complications in type 1 diabetes, especially in patients with advanced retinopathy.

**Background and aims:**
Data-driven identification of diabetes clus- ters provides a practicable method to address disease heterogeneity yet can be affected by disease duration and treatment. Here, we propose a modified clustering algorithm for already treated persons excluding HbA1c as clustering variable, making cluster assignment more inde- pendent from current treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
Participants of the German Diabetes Study (GDS) with diabetes diagnosed within the past 12 months (N=940) were classified into clusters with (w/HbA1c) and without HbA1c (w/ oHbA1c). At 5-year intervals, for up to 15 years, participants under- went comprehensive phenotyping including assessment of insulin secretion by intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), diabetic retinopathy by fundus photography, and peripheral as well as auto- nomic neuropathy (by functional and clinical measures). To compare the discriminative ability of the two approaches for detecting diabetes- related comorbidities, receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed and analysed. To validate our analysis in an independent cohort, we investigated subtype representation in adults with type 2 diabetes (N=794) undergoing coronary diagnostics from the Ludwig- shafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) cohort.

**Results:**
The prevalence of severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) increased from 3.3% to 19.9% when clustered w/oHbA1c by reclassi- fication of mild age-related diabetes (N=133) and mild obesity-related diabetes cases (N=47). Given the increased prevalence of SIDD and its association with insulin secretion failure, retinopathy and neuropa- thy in prior studies, we further focused on these outcomes. The inci- dence of retinopathy was the highest in SIDD using both approaches (w/HbA1c: 16.1%, p=0.027; w/oHbA1c: 14.4%, p<0.0001). However, the discriminative ability for retinopathy was higher with the approach w/oHbA1c, achieving an area under the curve of 0.74 compared to 0.66. There was no difference for discriminative ability for periph- eral (p=0.13) or autonomic (p=0.59) neuropathy. Individuals classi- fied as SIDD using the approach w/oHbA1c better predicted insulin secretion failure than those classified as SIDD w/HbA1c (p=0.01). In the LURIC cohort, excluding HbA1c also increased prevalence of SIDD from 2.1% to 9.2%, showing higher mortality in SIRD and MARD compared to MOD in both methods, whereas in the approach w/oHbA1c all-cause mortality for SIDD was lower compared to SIRD and MARD.

**Conclusion:**
Excluding HbA1c from the clustering variables in indi- viduals with a prior diabetes diagnosis enhanced the ability to detect diabetic retinopathy and insulin secretion failure in the SIDD cluster. This adaptation of the clustering algorithm thereby improves the clas- sification of diabetes heterogeneity, possibly offering practical benefits for precision diabetology.

**Background and aims:**
Hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes mel- litus (T2DM) share risk factors like insulin resistance and obesity, with HTN worsening cardiovascular mortality in T2DM. This study is a subgroup analysis of the safety and effectiveness of the telmisartan/ amlodipine (T/A) FDC in Indian hypertensive patients with T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
TACT India was a real-world prospective, multicentre, observational study involving Indian patients with HTN, conducted from September 2023 to June 2024. Adult patients aged ≥18 years with newly diagnosed HTN (systolic blood pressure [SBP]/ diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥140/90 mmHg) or those inadequately controlled on monotherapy, who were eligible for initiating the T/A FDC were included. The primary endpoint was to assess the change in SBP from baseline to end of study (week 8 [+2 weeks] - EOS). This subgroup analysis is carried out to understand the treatment effective- ness and safety of T/A FDC amongst hypertensive patients with T2DM. Ethics Committee approval and Informed consent were obtained.

**Results:**
A total of 5363 evaluable patients were analysed, of which 72.11% hypertensive patients with T2DM were included for analysis. They had a mean (SD) age in years (y) of 57.52 (11.30) with a male pre- dominance (53.96%) having history of HTN present in 72.34% patients, with a mean duration of 5.94 y. The mean (SD) SBP (mmHg) at baseline was 155.10 (6.64) which reduced to 136 mmHg (6.80), at EOS showing a reduction of 19.11 mmHg (P<0.001). Similarly, the mean (SD) DBP (mmHg) at baseline was 104.47 (6.67) which, reduced to 88.42 (1.72), at EOS showing a reduction of 16.05 mmHg (P<0.001). There were three reported adverse events (all mild in severity). A majority (>98%) of physicians agreed that the T/A FDC was effective and well-tolerated; similarly, >99% of patients were satisfied with the treatment.

**Conclusion:**
Results from this subgroup analysis demonstrate a sig- nificant reduction in BP from baseline with T/A FDC in Indian hyper- tensive patients with T2DM.

**Background and aims:**
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of insulin resistance risk levels, central obesity, and glycemic status on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and to explore the interaction effects between these factors and gender. Given the escalating prevalence of obesity and diabetes worldwide, understanding how these conditions interact to affect SBP is crucial for developing targeted interventions aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study was approved by the Ethics Committee and utilized data from a 2023 governmental screening program involving 120,266 adults. Insulin resistance was assessed using the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), with risk levels categorized as low (<8.5), moderate (8.5-9.0), and high (>9.0).

**Results:**
The mean age of participants was 44.3 ± 15.2 years, with 39.2% (n=49,270) male and 41.4% (n=49,749) residing in urban areas. The distribution of insulin resistance risk levels was 62.8% low, 22.5% moderate, and 14.7% high. Regression analysis revealed that males typi- cally had lower SBP compared to females, decreasing by 2.467 mmHg (p < 0.001). SBP increases were observed with higher insulin resistance, with increases of 1.549 mmHg for moderate risk and 4.072 mmHg for high risk (both p < 0.001). Significant interaction effects indicated that males at higher risk levels experienced disproportionately greater increases in SBP, with additional increases of 2.426 mmHg for moderate risk and 2.663 mmHg for high risk (both p < 0.001). Central obesity was associated with higher SBP across all risk levels. Specifically, in the context of glycemic status, SBP for individuals with normal glu- cose tolerance (NGT) and central obesity increased from 116 mmHg to approximately 123.5 mmHg, while for those with impaired fasting glu- cose (IFG), SBP increased from about 118 mmHg to 129 mmHg. Those with diabetes (DM) demonstrated an even greater increase in SBP from 120 mmHg without central obesity to 128 mmHg with central obesity.

**Conclusion:**
Insulin resistance, central obesity, and glycemic status significantly influence SBP, with interaction effects suggesting that males at higher risk levels experience greater increases in SBP. These findings underscore the need for integrated cardiovascular risk man- agement strategies, particularly focusing on high-risk populations with multiple comorbid conditions.

**Vascular mechanoreceptors magnetic activation, haemodynamic evidence, and potential applications in diabetic macro- and micro- vascular dysfunction**

J. Gmitrov

1. Diabetology Clinic, Krompachy Hospital, Agel SK inc, Krompachy,
2. Slovakia, National Institute of Public Health, Tokyo, Japan.

**Background and aims:**
Vascular mechanoreceptors and the auto- nomic dysfunction are key players in the development of type 2 dia- betes and its cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. The goal was to identify the relationship between carotid and microvascular mechanoreceptor vasodilator activity, which is triggered by magnetic stimulation, with a focus on possible application in diabetic macro- and microvascular complications.

**Materials and methods:**
Static magnetic field (SMF), by ­Nd -Fe -B magnets, was selectively exposed in conscious rabbits either to ear cutaneous microvascular networks (MN) or carotid baroreceptors (CB) for 40 min. The ­SMF series had 20 sham and 20 SMF (250 mT), while the ­SMF series included 14 sham and 14 SMF (350 mT) experiments. In the ­SMF series, at the same time, ear cutaneous microcirculatory blood flow by microphotoelectric plethysmography (MPPG), heart rate (HR), and mean femoral artery blood pressure (BP) were measured. Arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was estimated by assessing the BP and HR responses to intravenous (i.v.) bolus doses of nitroprusside (Ni) and phenylephrine (Fig. 1).

**Results:**
For both SMF applications, there was a significant increase in microvascular dilatation with ­SMF increasing by 17.9 ± 9.58% (p = 0.0136) and ­SMF by 22.6 ± 11.11% (p = 0.039%), which was not mutually statistically different, and a noticeable rise in vasomotion. In the ­SMF series, there were decreases in BP (-6.2%), an increase in BRS (+68.8%), HR variability (HRV, +20.6%), and the same dose of Ni microvascular dilatory effect (+304.2%), which acts as a spontane- ous nitric oxide (NO) donor (Fig. 1). A positive correlation between ­BRS and MPPG was found (r = 0.66, p < 0.009).

**Conclusion:**
CB magnetic activation and enhancements in BP and microcirculatory control were evidenced by a significant decrease in BP and increases in HRV, ­BRS , and MPPG. Improved CB pressure sensitivity by CB membrane SMF ­Ca transient facilitation mecha- nism may be behind this effect. However, microvessel mechanorecep- tor magnetic activation was also confirmed by increased vasomotion (Fig. 1, upper panel), which assumes responsiveness for both mechani- cal and magnetic cues. This is corroborated by CB magnetic activation, believed to be the standard vascular mechanoreceptor. A growing body of evidence suggests that SMF diminishes ischemic foot ulcers and diabetic neuropathic pain, which is likely attributable to vasodilation by the vascular mechanoreceptors magnetic activation mechanism. Enhanced vasomotion, which is reduced in diabetes, provides addi- tional benefit in oxygen transfer to ischemic tissues when blood flow through critically narrowed arteries is limited. SMF simultaneous expo- sure to CB and injured diabetic tissues may enhance the healing process and enable the treatment of high CV risk combined hyperglycemic and hypertensive vascular damage by triggering both central and peripheral mechanoreceptor vasodilator physiology.

**Background and aims:**
Hypertension significantly amplifies cardio- vascular risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite this known association, the age-specific prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension in newly diagnosed T2DM remains poorly characterized. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and severity of hypertension across different age groups in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM and evaluate its implications for cardiovascular risk assessment.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 591 patients diagnosed with T2DM within the previous 3 months. Patients were stratified into three age groups: young adults (18-40 years, n=214), middle-aged (41-50 years, n=164), and older adults (>50 years, n=213). Blood pressure was measured following standard- ized protocols. Hypertension was defined according to current inter- national guidelines (≥130/80 mmHg). Additional cardiovascular risk factors including BMI, lipid profile, waist circumference, and family history were assessed. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify age-specific predictors of hypertension

**Results:**
The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension demonstrated a strong age-dependent gradient, affecting 11.2% (20/178) of young adults, 23.0% (32/139) of middle-aged adults, and 50.0% (93/186) of older adults with newly diagnosed T2DM (p<0.001). Mean sys- tolic blood pressure increased significantly with age: 126.5 mmHg (18-40 years), 129.7 mmHg (41-50 years), and 133.1 mmHg (>50 years) (p<0.001). Grade 1 hypertension was more prevalent in older adults (33.3%) compared to middle-aged (29.3%) and young adults (21.1%). Furthermore, older adults exhibited significantly higher rates of additional cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity (51.1% with BMI ≥27.6 kg/m²) and dyslipidemia (66.7% with LDL >100 mg/dL), creating a concerning pattern of multiple concurrent risk factors.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings reveal a strikingly high prevalence of undi- agnosed hypertension in older adults with newly diagnosed T2DM, suggesting a critical window for early intervention. This age-dependent pattern of "silent hypertension" highlights the need for comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment at diabetes diagnosis, particularly in older adults. Implementation of systematic blood pressure screening in newly diagnosed T2DM patients could significantly improve early detection and management of hypertension, potentially modifying car- diovascular outcomes in this high-risk population.

**Association between grip strength and risk of metabolic multimor- bidity in Chinese adults: a prospective cohort study**

T. Gao

**Background and aims:**
Increased grip strength was related to reduced risks of metabolic diseases including diabetes and hypertension. How- ever, no studies have assessed whether grip strength is associated with the risk of metabolic multimorbidity in middle-aged and older adults. This study aimed to address this issue.

**Materials and methods:**
We included 4,352 participants without meta- bolic multimorbidity at baseline from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. These participants were followed up for about 4 years. Metabolic multimorbidity was defined as the coexistence of two or more metabolic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipi- demia, and hyperuricaemia. Grip strength from the dominant hand was measured and normalized by body weight. Cox regression analysis was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

**Results:**
During 4-year follow-up, 791 participants (18%) developed metabolic multimorbidity. Grip strength was significantly lower in individuals with metabolic multimorbidity than in those without (p < 0.001). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, each 1-standard-deviation increase in grip strength was associated with a 13% reduction in the risk of metabolic multimorbidity (HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80-0.93). The following metabolic disease combinations were significantly negatively correlated with grip strength: hypertension-dia- betes (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.97, < 0.05), diabetes-dyslipidaemia (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66-0.89, < 0.05) and the coexistence of all three conditions (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.41-0.88, < 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Higher grip strength is associated with a lower risk of metabolic multimorbidity in middle-aged and older Chinese adults.

**Background and aims:**
The noninvasive visceral adiposity index (VAI) is linked to the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The relationship of Chinese VAI (CVAI) and it’s dynamic change with hypertension and comorbidities still unclear. This study aims to exam- ine the associations between CVAI, its trajectories, and hypertensive comorbidities.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included 5,058 participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), with baseline data collected in 2011-2012. Participants were subse- quently followed across four waves: 2013-2014, 2015-2016, 2017- 2018, and 2019-2020. Study outcomes included hypertension (HTN) and its comorbidities: overweight (HTN-OW), metabolic unhealthi- ness (HTN-MET), and diabetes (HTN-DM). Prospective associations between baseline CVAI and these outcomes were analyzed using Cox regression. Longitudinal trajectories of CVAI over 3 years (2012-2015) were identified through K-means clustering analysis.

**Results:**
From 2013 to 2020, 1581 participants (31.3% of the 5058 total) developed HTN. The higher CVAI was significantly associated with risk of HTN-OW (HR per 1 SD increase = 1.20; 95%CI: 1.08 to 1.33) and other outcomes (HTN, HTN-MET, and HTN-DM) (HR per 1 SD increase = 1.20~1.23, < 0.05). Meanwhile, the risks of HTN and co-morbidities increased by 33% and 65% with each quartile increment in CVAI and cumulative CVAI, respectively ( -trend < 0.05). K-means clustering analysis generated three trajectories of change in CVAI lev- els (low, moderate, and high) between 2012 and 2015, and higher class was significantly associated with risk of HTN and co-morbidities com- pared to low class (HR = 1.63~1.65, < 0.05, -trend < 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
The findings highlight the significant positive correlation between the change in CVAI with hypertension and comorbidities in the middle-aged and elderly population, suggesting a potential appli- cation in the clinical assessment and prevention of cardiometabolic disease.

**Background and aims:**
Studies have shown that insulin stimulates flow in the arterial bed in the forearm and increases renal flow and glomerular filtration rate, preceding diabetic nephropathy. A general hyperdynamic circulation in diabetes has been proposed but never evaluated. We tested this hypothesis in a dataset on people acutely admitted to a tertiary hospital in Denmark for treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
951 unselected patients including 157 with diabetes, had measured systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac index (CIx, i.e., cardiac output / body surface area) using the finger clamp method and pulse contour analysis for 10 minutes within 24 hours from admission to a tertiary hospital in Denmark.

**Results:**
SVR was 25% (P<0.0001) lower in people with diabetes, and CIx was 20% higher (P<0.0001). In regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, body-mass-index (BMI), ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, infection, smoking habits and medication for hypertension, respectively, it was observed that diabetes and BMI remained strongly associated with SVR (Table1) and CIx (Table2). People with diabetes who were treated by insulin (n=44) had a 20% lower SVR (P=0.002) compared to those with diabetes not treated by insulin and had 11% higher CIx (P=0.029). Systolic blood pressure at admission was similar between people with diabe- tes (mean, SD) 140 (26) mmHg compared to those without 137 (27) mmHg (P=0.08).

**Conclusion:**
The data support the notion that a hyperdynamic circu- lation is a hallmark of diabetes and obesity, mainly due to relatively decreased resistance in the vascular bed and compensated increased cardiac output.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) represent a major clinical concern, often resulting from impaired macrophage efferocy- tosis, which contributes to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and chronic inflammation, thus hindering the wound healing process. The present study aims to investigate the role of Ajuba, an efferocytosis- associated protein, in modulating macrophage efferocytosis and its subsequent impact on diabetic wound healing, with a particular focus on the molecular mechanism by which Ajuba activates mitophagy.

**Materials and methods:**
Immunofluorescence staining and RT-qPCR were employed to evaluate the alterations in macrophage efferocytosis within diabetic wound tissues, while bioinformatics analysis identi- fied Ajuba as a key regulatory protein. The effects of hyperglycemia on macrophage efferocytosis were assessed using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. In vitro models of Ajuba overexpression and knockdown were constructed to elucidate its functional role in macrophage efferocytosis. Additionally, in vivo experiments using a diabetic mouse model overexpressing Ajuba were conducted to validate the involvement of Ajuba-induced mitophagy in promoting wound healing. The interaction between Ajuba and Beclin1, a critical mitophagy-related protein, was investigated through immunoprecipi- tation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS), co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), and proximity ligation assays (PLA).

**Results:**
In diabetic wounds, macrophage efferocytosis was signifi- cantly compromised, and Ajuba expression was notably downregu- lated in macrophages. Overexpression of Ajuba in Raw264.7 cells and primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) under high-glucose conditions restored efferocytosis. Further analysis by transmission electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, and Western blot confirmed that Ajuba activated mitophagy, a process that was validated using mitophagy inhibitors (CQ and 3-MA) and activators (CCCP and RAPA). In vivo, Ajuba overexpression enhanced mac- rophage efferocytosis at the wound margin in diabetic mice, thereby accelerating wound closure, while mitophagy inhibition reduced this effect. Molecular mechanisms revealed that Ajuba directly interacted with Beclin1, modulating the Beclin1-BCL2 complex, which is pivotal in mitophagy regulation, further promoting macrophage efferocytosis and wound healing.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates that Ajuba regulates macrophage efferocytosis in diabetic wounds by activating mitophagy through its interaction with Beclin1. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic wound healing and suggest that Ajuba may serve as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing wound repair in diabetic patients.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), frequently arising from impaired angiogenesis, are a common diabetes com- plication. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of platelet-derived exosomes (PLT-Exos) in promoting angiogenesis and accelerating wound healing in diabetic models, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms.

**Materials and methods:**
PLT-Exos were isolated from activated platelets, and their therapeutic potential was assessed both using diabetic mice and with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to high glucose conditions. , diabetic mice were treated with PLT-Exos, and wound healing was monitored over 9 days. Histological analysis, including Masson’s trichrome and immunostaining, was performed to evaluate wound closure, collagen deposition, and vascularization. , HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation were assessed using CCK-8, transwell, and tube formation assays. Proteomic analysis identified key molecular changes in response to PLT-Exos, particu- larly the upregulation of Gdf15. The effects of Gdf15 were further explored through knockdown and overexpression experiments.

**Results:**
, PLT-Exos significantly enhanced wound closure by 92.49% on day 9, compared to 81.71% in control groups (p < 0.05). Histological analysis revealed increased collagen deposition and more pronounced vascularization in the PLT-Exos group. , PLT-Exos treatment significantly promoted HUVEC proliferation (p < 0.01), migration (p < 0.01), and tube formation (p < 0.01). Proteomic analysis identified Gdf15 as a key upregulated factor in HUVECs treated with PLT-Exos. Knockdown of Gdf15 significantly impaired HUVEC migration and tube formation (p < 0.05), while overexpression of Gdf15 restored these functions (p < 0.01). Gdf15 activated the Akt signaling pathway, which was further validated using an Akt inhibitor, confirming that the Gdf15/Akt pathway plays a critical role in the pro-angiogenic effects of PLT-Exos.

**Conclusion:**
PLT-Exos significantly promoted angiogenesis and accelerated wound healing in diabetic mice through the Gdf15/Akt signaling pathway. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of PLT-Exos in diabetic wound healing and proposes a novel Gdf15- loaded PMVs platform as a promising strategy for enhancing wound repair in diabetic patients.

**Background and aims:**
Wound healing in diabetes is impaired by persistent low-grade chronic inflammation, reduced angiogenesis, and disordered skin and immune cell activities, leading to delayed wound closure, fibrosis, and increased risk of complications such as infections and pathological scarring. The inflammatory state-specific microRNA-146a-5p, highly increased in diabetes, is not well charac- terized in wound healing. Moreover, miR-146a-5p has been shown to influence ECM remodeling by regulating the expression of proteins critical in wound healing. Given its central role in inflammation and ECM remodeling, the aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of miR-146a-5p inhibition in human fibroblasts behavior on wound healing responses.

**Materials and methods:**
Human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were cul- tured in high glucose DMEM. medium. HDFs were transfected with an LNA-spiked phosphothioate antisense oligo for miR-146a-5p (miR-146 inhibitor) and a scramble control (Scr) in low, medium and high con- centrations (6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50pmol/L). Cell lysates were collected for proteomic analysis. Tryptic peptides were applied to nanoLC on MS/MS (on QExactive+), and quantified and assessed for quality con- trol using MaxQuant and Perseus tools. The p values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant after FDR correction.

**Results:**
Proteome-wide analysis of HDF identified 2056 proteins in whole-cell lysates. Notably, proteins involved in ECM organization and angiogenesis were differentially regulated in a dose-dependent manner following miR-146a-5p inhibition. A total of 47 proteins were signifi- cantly regulated, 34 proteins being significantly upregulated, and 13 proteins downregulated. Among these, Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) and Collagen 12 alpha 1 (COL12A1), were overall upregulated by miR-146 inhibition (THBS1, miR-146 inhibition 24.45+/-0,64 vs. Scr 22.51+/-0.56 LFQ values, p<0.001, and COL12A1 miR-146 inhibi- tion 21.44+/-0,52 vs. Scr 19,64+/-0.76 LFQ values, p<0.001), in a dose-dependent manner.

**Conclusion:**
Inhibition of miR-146a-5p in HDFs upregulated THBS1 and COL12A1, revealing a previously unrecognized role of fibro- blasts in miR-146a-5p-mediated wound healing. THBS1 may enhance macrophage-driven repair, while COL12A1 supports ECM integrity and fibroblast adhesion. These findings suggest that fibroblast-targeted miR-146a-5p inhibition could enhance ECM remodelling and optimize tissue regeneration in diabetic wounds. Targeting miR-146a-5p could be a promising approach to improving wound healing in diabetes

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the most severe complication of T2DM, affecting over 30% of T2DM patients. How- ever, targeted pharmacological intervention strategies remain limited. Research has shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) play a central regulatory role in metabolic homeostasis and endothelial function regulation. Nevertheless, their molecular mech- anisms in diabetic wound repair have not yet been fully elucidated. This study systematically investigates the role of PPARs signaling in diabetic wound healing, aiming to expand the potential clinical appli- cations of PPARs-targeted first-line drugs in the treatment of DFU.

**Materials and methods:**
(1) Clinical validation: Differentially expressed genes in DFU tissues were screened using the GEO data- set, followed by enrichment analysis to identify key pathways. PPARs expression in neovascularization was validated qRT-PCR, immu- nofluorescence, and western blot. (2) studies: A diabetic model was established using streptozotocin and high-fat diet induction. Inter- vention groups received pan-PPARs agonist, PPARγ-specific agonist, or vehicle control. Wound closure rates, collagen deposition, angio- genesis (CD31/α-SMA co-staining), and cellular proliferation were dynamically monitored. (3) studies: AGEs-induced HUVECs were subjected to PPARs activation. Functional assays included scratch wound healing, transwell migration, and tube formation. Whole- transcriptome sequencing identified critical signaling axes, validated through transmission electron microscopy, SHH knockdown, and SHH agonist interventions. Mitochondrial function was assessed JC-10 staining, mPTP, MitoTracker, ATP quantification, and Seahorse analysis.

**Results:**
PPARs expression was significantly downregulated in DFU tissues, particularly in neovasculature. Pan-PPARs activation acceler- ated diabetic wound closure, enhanced collagen deposition, promoted granulation tissue proliferation, and improved angiogenesis VEGF- A upregulation. In AGEs-induced HUVECs, PPARs activation dem- onstrated cytoprotective effects, elevating VEGF-A/CD31 activity, enhancing anti-apoptotic capacity, and restoring migration and tube formation capacity. Mechanistically, PPARs activated mitochondrial membrane function and the OXPHOS process the SHH/PTCH- mitochondrial axis, thereby boosting endothelial cell activity. Rescue experiments indicated that SHH knockdown abolished PPARs-medi- ated mitochondrial and angiogenic improvements.

**Conclusion:**
PPARs signaling critically regulates diabetic wound healing, with its suppression contributing to DFU-associated vascu- lopathy. PPARs signaling activation significantly enhances endothelial cell energy metabolism and angiogenesis ability the SHH/PTCH1- mitochondrial axis. This study enhances understanding of diabetic wound healing mechanisms, offering a theoretical basis and potential treatments using PPARs agonists for DFU.

**Background and aims:**
Charcot neuroarthropathy (CNO) of the foot is characterized by an increased bone turnover as denoted by serological markers of bone resorption. However, the histological characteristics of foot bones in people with CNO is not well elucidated.

**Materials and methods:**
The foot bone samples were collected from patients who had either surgical reconstruction or below-knee amputa- tions for chronic CNO foot (n=10, Group A), unsalvageable diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) (n = 16, Group B), and non-diabetic healthy controls following road traffic accident (n = 16, group C). Calcaneum bones retrieved were processed. Each case involved eight slides in total—four stained with Haemotoxylin & Eosin and four stained with the Masson- Goldner stain. The histopathological parameters were calculated by taking the mean of 4 slides for each parameter of the respective stain. The quantitative histopathological parameters including bony trabecu- lae number, trabeculae thinning, osteoclast number, Howship’s lacunae, and Haversian canal were studied. Inter group comparisons were done with Kruskal-Walis test with bon-Ferroni correction for variables not normally distributed amongst the three groups. Mann-Whitney test was performed for pairwise comparison.

**Results:**
Mean age of participants in the CNO group was 61.6±5.0 and 62.9±6.5 years in diabetic neuropathy group with duration of dia- betes 13.1±6.8 and 14.1±9.1 years with HbA1c of 7.6±1.8 % and 8.7±2.6 in group A and B respectively. We observed that the normal bone trabeculae were 15%(10-37.5) in group A and 60% (47.5-82.5) in group B as compared to controls (p=<0.01). Thin Bone trabeculae (%) were observed in 10%(3.5-77.5) and 7.5% (0-30) ; p<0.01); increased Howship’s lacunae number (1.5(0.25-2) and 1(0-2.25) (p=<0.01); and increased osteoclast number in group A and B as compared to healthy controls. Descriptively, fragmented bony trabeculae with tunnel effect, dead bone fragments with compensated hypertrophy, and an increased rate of marrow fibrosis were observed in Charcot bone. The number of Haversian canals were higher and inter-trabecular spaces showed mar- row fibrosis with dilated capillary channels in the DFU group compared to CNO or controls

**Conclusion:**
There is an increased bone resorption in CNO causing thinning of bone trabeculae secondary to increased osteoclast num- bers and Howship’s lacunae in CNO of foot. Anti-resorptive therapies that target osteoclast activity may be an appealing treatment option for diabetic CNO of foot.

**AZGP1-medicated mitophagy regulates epithelialisation to enhance diabetic wound healing via PINK1 interaction**

S. Rui, W. ­Deng, Q. ­Li, F. ­Xiao, W. ­Mou, A. David ­G

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a significant clinical challenge, often due to impaired epithelialization, resulting in delayed wound healing and chronic inflammation. This study inves- tigates the role of AZGP1, an epithelialization-associated protein, in regulating epithelial cell function and its impact on diabetic wound healing, focusing on the molecular mechanism by which AZGP1 acti- vates mitophagy through PINK1 binding.

**Materials and methods:**
Immunofluorescence staining and RT-qPCR were used to assess changes in epithelialization in diabetic wound tis- sues, while bioinformatics analysis identified AZGP1 as a key regu- latory protein. Cytological experiments utilized both epithelial cell lines (Hacat) and primary cells (NHEK) to evaluate the effects of high- glucose conditions on epithelial cell behavior. AZGP1 overexpression and knockdown models were used to explore its role in epithelializa- tion. , epithelial-specific overexpression of AZGP1 mice and AZGP1 epithelial strip knock-on mice were employed to investigate the impact of AZGP1 on epithelialization and wound healing. The inter- action between AZGP1 and PINK1, a key mitophagy-related protein, was analyzed using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS), co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), and proximity ligation assays (PLA).

**Results:**
In diabetic wounds, epithelialization was impaired, and AZGP1 expression was downregulated. Overexpression of AZGP1 in Hacat and NHEK cells under high-glucose conditions restored epitheli- alization. Transmission electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, and Western blot confirmed AZGP1’s role in activating mitophagy. , AZGP1-overexpressing diabetic mice showed enhanced wound heal- ing, accelerated epithelialization, and improved collagen deposition. In contrast, AZGP1 epithelial strip knock-on mice had disorganized reepithelialization and delayed diabetic wound healing. Angiogen- esis was increased in AZGP1-overexpressing mice, shown by higher CD31-positive capillaries and VEGFA expression. Granulation tissue proliferation was enhanced, with more fibroblast infiltration and ECM remodeling. Mechanically, mitophagy inhibition reduced the beneficial effects of AZGP1, confirming AZGP1’s role in promoting epithelializa- tion through PINK1-mediated mitophagy.

**Conclusion:**
AZGP1 regulates epithelialization in diabetic wounds by activating mitophagy through its interaction with PINK1. These findings provide insights into diabetic wound healing and suggest that AZGP1 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing wound repair in diabetic patients.

2. tralia, University of Western Sydney, Penrith, Australia.

**Background and aims:**
People with diabetes-related foot ulcers (DFU) experience disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) yet are often excluded from exercise programs due to wound care needs, mobility limitations, and clinical risk. The aim of this study was to assess the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of a tailored exer- cise intervention to improve cardiovascular health in people with DFU.

**Materials and methods:**
Participants with active DFU were ran- domised to either a supervised exercise program or usual care for 12 weeks. The intervention involved 3 times weekly supervised aerobic and strength training while accommodating offloading and wound care requirements. Key outcomes included changes in cardiorespiratory fit- ness, blood pressure and blood lipids. Safety, adherence, and wound healing were also monitored.

**Results:**
n=74 potential participants were screened for eligibility and n=17 adults with diabetes and an active foot ulcer were recruited. Mean age was 59.4±12 years, BMI 30.0±4.6 kg/m², systolic BP was 124±13 mmHg and diastolic BP 75±5.8, and baseline VO peak was very low at 11.3±1.9 mL/kg/min. Compared with control, the exercise group demonstrated significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness (exer- cise +2.9mL/kg/min increase versus control -0.5mL/kg/min, p=0.03). There were no adverse events related to exercise and no difference in wound healing was observed between groups. The exercise sessions were well attended (mean attendance 75±12%). Blood lipids, blood pressure, wound healing and glycaemia were not changed with exercise.

**Conclusion:**
The DFU-Ex Study demonstrates that exercise is feasi- ble and safe in people with DFU and may offer clinically meaningful improvements in cardiovascular health. These findings challenge cur- rent assumptions around exercise contraindications in this population and support its inclusion as a CVD risk reduction strategy in diabetes care. Future research is needed to examine the impact of aerobic and resistance training on cardiovascular and wound outcomes in people with a DFU.

**Multimodal approach to post-revascularisation monitoring among diabetes patients with peripheral artery disease in a tertiary high- risk foot clinic: outcomes at 6 months**

S. Promislow

**Background and aims:**
A global average of 6.4% people with diabetes have of diabetic foot ulcers, which is often concomitant with peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD with an ulcer, gangrene, and/or pain at rest can lead to amputation without revascularization to restore blood per- fusion. The integrated patient unit (IPU) was established at the Sheba Medical Center to address the lower-extremity high amputation rates in Israel due to diabetic foot ulcers (17 per 100,000 individuals compared to the OECD average 8). The IPU has a unique multidisciplinary team and a multimodal postoperative monitoring system, including remote monitoring, a wound clinic, and periodic ultrasound exams. This study evaluates outcomes for IPU patients with diabetes and PAD following revascularization.

**Materials and methods:**
Data is collected from IPU patient records at baseline and every 3 months, up to 12 months after the procedure, including demographic information, clinical indices, and patient reported outcome measures. Between June 2023 and July 2025, 107 cases of PAD in patients with diabetes underwent revascularization and enrolled in postoperative monitoring. Herein, we focus on mid- term outcomes at 6 months’ follow-up. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. A p-value below 0.05 was considered significant.

**Results:**
Of the 107 cases, 78.5% were among male patients, who were a mean age of 74.64 years (SD 9.58) and had diabetes for a mean dura- tion of 21.39 years (SD 11.56); 56.1% were treated with insulin and 22.4% with dialysis. A substantial number of patients/cases were lost to follow up within the first 6 months due to major amputation (n=23), death (n=10), declined monitoring or continued care elsewhere (n=7). Improvements in clinical indices were minor and largely insignificant and blood perfusion gradually declined. Significant improvements were observed in pain scores, from 6.36 (SD 3.44) at baseline to 3.09 (SD 3.53) at 6 months (p<0.001), and patient diabetes distress levels from baseline (PAID score 29.39, SD 19.48) to 6 months (PAID score 22.71, SD 22.86, p=0.048). Patient satisfaction with recovery remained con- sistently high (See Table 1).

**Conclusion:**
While it may not significantly improve clinical outcomes, the IPU’s multimodal approach to postoperative monitoring may be successful in improving patients’ quality of life. Prevention and early detection must be implemented along with the IPU model of care to prevent disease severity and amputation.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic wounds often involve chronic inflam- mation, impaired angiogenesis, and an increased risk of infection. To address these challenges, biocompatible scaffolds that support tis- sue regeneration are increasingly needed. To enhance the regenera- tive properties of decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) derived from and , a composite hydrogel was devel- oped. Using 3D bioprinting technology, a customized wound healing patch was created and applied to BALB/c mice.

**Materials and methods:**
Tilapia and carp skin tissues were decellular- ized to produce tilapia skin-derived dECM (tsdECM) and carp skin- derived dECM (csdECM), followed by quantitative analyses of DNA, collagen, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), elastin, and free fatty acids. A tsdECM/csdECM-based hydrogel with HaCaT cells was 3D bioprinted into a net-like skin construct. To evaluate the patch’s effectiveness, 6 mm wounds were induced on the dorsal skin of BALB/c mice, and the patch was applied. The wound healing process was monitored, and immune responses were assessed through histology and FACS, confirming biocompatibility and regenerative effects. The experiment was also conducted in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model to evaluate the efficacy of the tsdECM/csdECM-based 3D bioprinted patch.

**Results:**
After decellularization, the DNA content in tilapia and carp skin decreased from 126.19 ± 4.36 ng/mg and 587.56 ± 13.46 μg/mg to 20.88 ± 1.44 μg/mg and 43.38 ± 2.88 μg/mg, respectively, repre- senting a reduction of over 95%. The 3D bioprinted tsdECM/csdECM constructs exhibited high porosity (>90%) and enhanced mechanical stability. The tsdECM/csdECM composite containing 10 mg/mL of csdECM showed over 95% cell viability in HaCaT cells, confirming its suitability for in vivo applications. In BALB/c mice, the patch sig- nificantly improved wound healing compared to conventional collagen patches. The tsdECM/csdECM-treated group exhibited a faster reduc- tion in wound size than both the control and positive control groups. Immune cell analysis revealed a notable decrease in inflammatory immune cells, particularly eosinophils, indicating effective inflamma- tion regulation. Additionally, the reduction of F4/80+ macrophages and CD11c+ dendritic cells suggested a rapid transition from inflammation to tissue repair. Notably, the significant decrease in F4/80+ MHCII+ antigen-presenting macrophages in the tsdECM/csdECM-treated group compared to the controls indicated suppressed excessive immune acti- vation, thereby supporting improved tissue regeneration.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates the potential of tsdECM/ csdECM-based 3D bioprinted patches as customized scaffolds for dia- betic wound healing. The results indicate that the tsdECM/csdECM patch provides an environment that promotes tissue repair while effectively modulating immune responses. Notably, the reduction in macrophages suggests a faster progression of wound healing into the remodeling phase. Additionally, the patch exhibited accelerated wound recovery and better immune balance modulation compared to collagen patches, confirming its strong potential as a biomaterial for wound healing.

**Background and aims:**
Lower limb amputation is a serious compli- cation of the diabetic foot syndrome, which entails both micro- and macrovascular disturbances subsequently leading to the necessity of surgery. Here we aimed to determine temporal trends and sex dif- ferences in outcome, comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors in lower limb amputations of patients with and without diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
1107 patients, who underwent non-trau- matic lower limb surgery from 2006 to 2022 at a Medical Univer- sity were analysed. Survival was modelled and predictors including anthropometrics, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, temporal trends and medication were studied.

**Results:**
Of the 1107 patients included in this study 54.9 % had dia- betes, 95.3 % of which belonged to type 2 diabetes. Overall survival was comparable in patients with and without diabetes with cumu- lative survival of 23.6 % versus 23.3 % after 10 years (p=0.122). However, patients with diabetes were younger (71.4 [63.3;79.5] vs. 76.2 [67.3;83.3] (years); p < 0.001) and had a higher BMI (26.2 [23.3;29.8] vs. 23.2 [20.5;26.7] (kg/m²); p < 0.001) at first surgical intervention. Male preponderance was more pronounced in patients with diabetes (82.5 % vs 64.3 %, p = 0.004). Hypertension was more frequently found in patients with diabetes (80.7 % vs 73.5 %; p = 0.005), while atrial fibrillation (20.9 % vs 28.1 %, p = 0.007) and COPD (12.0 % vs 20.9 %; p < 0.001) were more common in patients without diabetes. Within the diabetes group, LDL-C target of < 55 mg/dl was achieved in 22.9 % of patients, with even poorer rates in females than in males: Median LDL-C was 87.5 mg/dl in females and 74.0 mg/dl in males. While LDL-C levels decreased in male patients with diabetes from 2006 until the end of 2022 (85.0 [66.0;107] vs. 71.0 [52.0;89.0] (mg/dl); p = 0.01), LDL-C in female patients remained unchanged (83.0 [58.2;120] vs. 84.0 [50.5;112] (mg/dl); p = 0.651). Median Hba1c levels were comparable between male and female patients and remained stable over the study period (7.3 % (male patients) vs. 7.2 % (female patients), p = 0.437). While insulin usage had not effect on survival, metformin usage was associated with significantly better survival in patients with diabetes (10-year cumulative survival: 0.397 [0.304;0.519] vs. 0.213 [0.183;0.246], p = 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Lower-limb amputations remain associated with poor outcome in patients with and without diabetes with marked age gap in the disadvantage of diabetic patients. In patients with diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors including LDL cholesterol are still poorly controlled especially in females. Improved risk factor management is urgently needed to reduce the risk of lower limb amputations in patients with diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) increases the risk of foot ulceration (DFU) and mortality; yet traditional screening tests often detect DPN too late for effective prevention. This study compared the predictive validity of two point-of-care devices (POCDs): DPN-Check (hand-held sural nerve conduction/amplitude test) and SUDOSCAN (sudomotor function test), against the 128 Hz tuning fork vibration- and the 10g monofilament- tests, for incident DPN, DFU, and all-cause mortality.

**Materials and methods:**
229 consecutively included patients with dia- betes underwent the Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score, 10g mono- filament test, and POCD assessments at baseline and follow-up after 9 years. Outcomes assessed included all-cause mortality, incident clinical DPN (TCNS>5) and DFU, using adjusted Cox or logistic regression models. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), sen- sitivity, and specificity of abnormal findings were evaluated.

**Results:**
Baseline DPN prevalence was higher with POCD being abnormal (66.8%) than with monofilament testing (14.4%). At 9-year follow-up, 59 participants had died, and 35 (15.3%) developed DFU. POCDs significantly predicted clinical DPN (RR 9.6, CI: 2.3-39.4; sensitivity 80%, specificity 64%), DFU (RR 3.4, CI: 1.1-10.0; sen- sitivity 88%, specificity 37%), and mortality (RR 2.5, CI: 1.0-6.6; sensitivity 85%, specificity 40%). Vibration testing showed lower predictive performance for incident clinical DPN (RR 4.6, CI: 1.4- 15.4; sensitivity 60%, specificity 74%), DFU (RR 2.6, CI: 1.1-6.6; sensitivity 81%, specificity 45%), and mortality (RR 2.1, CI: 0.9-4.6; sensitivity 79%, specificity 48%). Monofilament testing demonstrated very high specificity but very low to extremely low sensitivity across all outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
POCDs exhibit superior sensitivity for clinical DPN, DFU, and mortality compared to vibration threshold and especially monofilament testing, supporting their integration into routine diabetes care, where early detection using a sensitive test can alter treatment and ultimately disease course.

**Background and aims:**
In a previous study we have shown the ben- eficial impact of a Multidisciplinary Diabetic Foot Unit (MDFU) on the amputation rate in a tertiary care hospital, which is the reference hospital in the Northern Barcelona area. In the present study we wanted to examined whether the general changes in management of diabetes care implemented by MDFU in close collaboration with the Primary Care engagement area of our hospital have reduced the cardiovascular mortality after diabetic foot amputation (DFA) at 5 year of follow-up. This is a meaningful issue because there is a high mortality after DFA (ranging from 40% to 70% within 5 years), cardiovascular causes being the most common.

**Materials and methods:**
An observational study was conducted ana- lyzing cases of DFA in two periods: from 01/01/2011 to 31/12/2015 (prior to the establishment of the Multidisciplinary Diabetic Foot Unit) and from 01/01/2016 to 31/12/2020. A total of 290 cases of patients who underwent amputations were analyzed.

**Results:**
Of the 290 cases included, 168 patients (57.9%) died. The deceased patients were older (71.1±10.1 vs. 62.7±11.1; p<0.001), had a longer duration of diabetes (20.7±9.7 vs. 16.5±9.2 years, p<0.001), higher prevalence of micro and/or macrovascular complications (79.2% vs. 59.0%, p<0.001), more rate of hypertension (84.4% vs. 72.2%; p=0.014), and presented higher rate of previous major amputations (36.9% vs. 13.1%, p<0.01). When comparing the two periods, five- year mortality decreased in the second period [65.3% (2011-2015) vs. 49.6% (2016-2020), p=0.006], mainly due to a reduction of a cardio- vascular mortality (54.0% vs. 41.2%, p=0.029). Notably, in the second period, there was an increased use of high-intensity statins (37.9% vs. 8.5%, p<0.01), combined use of statins and ezetimibe (19.4% vs. 5.1%, p<0.01), use of fibrates (35.0% vs. 23.9%, p=0.038). In addition, the use of GLP-1 agonists increased (15.3% vs. 1.3%, p<0.001), as did SGLT-2 inhibitors (6.6% vs. 0%, p<0.001), while the use of sulfonylu- reas decreased (2.1% vs. 15.0%, p<0.001). All these changes in medical treatments result in improvements of cardiovascular risk factors.

**Conclusion:**
The new strategies in treating diabetes have had a sig- nificant influence in reducing the cardiovascular mortality after DFA. Our results provide evidence that the strength collaboration between MDFU and Primary Care professionals is essential for improving the life expectancy after DFA.

**Background and aims:**
Immobilization, a primary method for treating diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), has a negative impact on bone mineral den- sity (BMD). Currently, it is possible to relieve the affected limb using specialized offloading, allowing patients to achieve greater mobility. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of limb offloading on BMD in patients with DFU.

**Materials and methods:**
The study involved 43 men with diabetes (DM1, n = 6; DM2, n = 37) who had diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) (n = 41) or Charcot neuroarthropathy (n = 2) and 30 men from the control group. The mean age (median [Q1-Q3]) of patients with DFU was 64.5 [56.5-69.0] years, while in the control group it was 60.5 [53.0-66.0] years; p = 0.213; the BMI were 29.2 [25.4-33.1] and 28.4 [25.5-33.3], respectively; p = 0.943. The diabetes duration was longer in the DFU group, at 15 years (10-20 years) compared to 10 years (6-15 years) in the control group; p = 0.042. Densitometric examinations of the lumbar spine and the proximal ends of both femurs were performed at baseline and after 6.3 (5.8-6.9) months of follow-up. Additionally, the selected circulating biochemical parameters were measured. The median duration of ulceration at the study’s initiation was 6 months (range, 3-16 months). The methods of offloading were as follows: 15 patients (34.9%) used a wheelchair, 25 (58.1%) an offloading shoe, and 3 people (7.0%) crutches, respectively.

**Results:**
At the study baseline, no differences were found in bone min- eral density (BMD) in the proximal femur and lumbar spine between the groups. BMD values in both groups, expressed as standard devia- tions (SD), were within the normal range. At the baseline, there were no differences in BMD between the affected and healthy limb. In the follow-up analysis comparing changes in BMD in the lumbar spine (L1-L4), total hip area and femoral neck, no differences were found between the groups. There were also no differences in BMD of the lumbar spine, total hip area and femoral neck between the first and second measurements regardless of the offloading method. In the DFU group, a lower concentration of vitamin D3 was found: 17.9 [12.1-26.1] ng/ml vs 26.6 [22.3-35.9] ng/ml; p < 0.001 and a higher concentration of alkaline phosphatase: 92.0 [76.0-106.0] U/l vs 67.0 [53.0-77.0] U/l; p < 0.001.

**Conclusion:**
Limb offloading used in the treatment of DFS does not affect the bone mineral density of the skeleton at a median follow-up of 6.3 months.

**3D printed nano-hydrogel containing PRP for the treatment of diabetic wound healing**

A. Guan

**Background and aims:**
Chronic diabetic wounds remain a clinical challenge due to impaired healing and poor angiogenesis. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), rich in growth factors, has been widely used for the regeneration of chronic wounds, but its rapid release and lack of a structural scaffold limit efficacy. Thus, this study developed a novel PRP-loaded nanogel hydrogel, which can be 3D printed and control PRP release and evaluated its 3D-printability and therapeutic efficacy in diabetic wound healing.

**Materials and methods:**
Nanogel hydrogels (15% gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), 15% Pluronic F68, 0.75% photoinitiator) were mixed and followed by digital light processing (DLP) 3D-printing of customized scaffolds. For PRP nanogel hydrogels, PRP were added into the poly- mer inks. Hydrogel microstructure was characterized by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The applicability of hydrogels to different wounds was evaluated using a simulated subcutaneous tunnel model. ELISA assay was used for quantitative analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (n=3). A CCK-8 proliferation assay was per- formed to identify an optimal concentration (n=3). In vivo biocom- patibility were evaluated by subcutaneously implanting the material onto the rat skin. For wound healing experiments, diabetic rats (n=6) with full-thickness dorsal skin wounds (8mm diameter) were treated with either no treatment (control), nanogel alone, PRP alone, or PRP nanogel (the allocation used the random number table method). Wound closure, histology, and immunofluorescence were analyzed on days 7, 14 and 21.

**Results:**
PRP with different concentrations were used for DLP 3D printing PRP nanogel hydrogel. After printing, the hydrogel exhibited geometries consistent with the design. SEM confirmed highly porous nanosphere architecture. The nanospheres and holes are interconnected. 15% PRP concentration demonstrated the best ability to enhance pri- mary dermal fibroblast cell proliferation (p<0.05, n=3). PRP nanogel facilitated sustained growth factor release (15 pg/ml VEGF retained at 72h vs 10 pg/ml in PRP). Using chicken breast to simulate sub- cutaneous tunnel model (linear, branched), PRP nanogel suitable for different types of subcutaneous tunnel shapes are filled into it. In terms of in vivo biocompatibility, 3D-printed hydrogels without cells were implanted subcutaneously. Minimal inflammation was observed in the surrounding tissue (H&E). In diabetic wound models, PRP nanogel significantly accelerated healing wound healing rate (at day 7, 31.2 % for the control group, 55.6% for the PRP group and 64.8% for the PRP nanogel group); and by day 21, nearly complete closure in the PRP nanogel group (91.5%) vs 76.4% in controls (p<0.01). H&E and Mas- son staining showed increased enhanced reepithelialization and wound closure in the PRP nanogel group. In addition, it also greatly increased angiogenesis, with ­CD31 vessels’ density 2-fold higher than control (p<0.01). After 4w of implantation of PRP nanogel, small blood ves- sels grew into the hydrogel, indicating the excellent ability of the mate- rial to promote vascular regeneration.

**Conclusion:**
The customizable nanogel hydrogel containing PRP sig- nificantly improved diabetic wound healing, via its cell-adaptable nano- structure (promoting cell proliferation and angiogenesis)​ and sustained release of growth factors, highlight its promise as a novel therapy for chronic diabetic foot ulcers.

**Background and aims:**
The risk prediction models for lower extrem- ity deep vein thrombosis (LEDVT) have been validated in patients with autoimmune diseases, malignant tumors, or post lower extremity orthopedic surgery. However, due to the complex pathological fea- tures characterizing diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients, including poor glycemic control, recurrent infections, and microcirculation disorders, existing models show limited applicability. This study aims to inves- tigate LEDVT risk factors in DFU patients, develop a disease-specific nomogram prediction model, and conduct clinical validation.

**Materials and methods:**
Clinical data from 557 DFU patients (49 LEDVT and 508 non-LEDVT) were retrospectively analyzed. Statis- tical analyses were performed using SPSS and R software to compare baseline characteristics and laboratory parameters. Based on a ran- dom number table, the cohort was divided into a training set (n=389, 70%) and a validation set (n=168, 30%). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify independ- ent risk factors and establish the prediction model, with subsequent validation through C-statistics, Hosmer-Lemeshow tests, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis.

**Results:**
Multivariate logistic regression identified age ≥60 years (OR=5.66, 95%CI 2.05-15.60; P<0.001), smoking his- tory (OR=3.23, 95%CI 1.50-6.98; P=0.003), glucocorticoid use (OR=4.53, 95%CI 1.59-12.90; P=0.005), diabetic retinopathy (OR=3.36, 95%CI 1.57-7.23; P=0.002), and lower extremity arte- riosclerosis obliterans (OR=2.36, 95%CI 1.08-5.17; P=0.032) as independent risk factors. The model demonstrated discriminative ability with C-statistics of 0.805 (95%CI 0.718-0.891) in the training set and 0.855 (95%CI 0.765-0.944) in the validation set. Hosmer- Lemeshow tests showed adequate fit (P=0.103 for training; P=0.940 for validation, both P>0.05), while calibration curves and decision curve analysis confirmed clinical utility.

**Conclusion:**
This study established a nomogram incorporating five independent risk factors for LEDVT in DFU patients. The model exhib- its satisfactory predictive accuracy and clinical applicability, providing a visual tool for individualized risk assessment and optimized preven- tive strategies for high-risk populations.

**Background and aims:**
International guidelines recommend regular foot assessment in people with diabetes to identify patients at higher risk of foot complications early. However, utilization of such preventive services is low. We aim to test a simplified foot screen for prelimi- nary foot assessment by non-clinical personnel with minimal training. This initial screen may help a wider pool of patients be assessed while serving to triage patients requiring a comprehensive foot screen, thus optimizing health professionals’ time.

**Materials and methods:**
Cross-sectional study in adults with diabetes, with prospective recruitment of participants from outpatient clinics and ongoing cohort studies. The simplified foot screen consisted of 6 yes or no questions and 4 assessment items (visual inspection of active prob- lems or deformities, assessment of touch, cold sensation and circulation using cotton swab, metal chopstick and pulse oximeter respectively). The standard clinical diabetic foot assessment was the reference test.

**Results:**
A total of 783 individuals were assessed. Using the national guidelines in Singapore, 194 (24.8%) were classified as having low (International Working Group for Diabetic Foot IWGDF very low), 357 (45.7%) as moderate (IWGDF low), and 231 (29.5%) as high (IWGDF moderate and high) risk of foot ulceration. Compared to the gold standard, the index test had a sensitivity of 92.7% (90.9%-94.5%) and specificity of 96.9% (95.7%-98.1%) in identifying those at moder- ate or high risk, with an overall accuracy of 93.7%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.95 (0.93-0.96). The inter-rater agreement for the index test was substantial with a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.64 (0.59-0.70).

**Conclusion:**
This simplified foot screen has high sensitivity, speci- ficity and good inter-rater reliability for identifying individuals with diabetes at moderate and high risk of foot ulceration. This screen can increase the reach of diabetic foot screening services by allowing non- clinical staff and even caregivers to perform the initial screen with minimal training. By using this screen for triaging, comprehensive in-clinic assessments can be reserved for those at higher risk, saving both patients and the health system time and costs.

1. Lariboisière Hospital, Paris, France, Dijon University Hospital,

**Background and aims:**
Toe necrosis is a common complication of dia- betic foot ulcer (DFU). Amputation surgery is usually performed by a surgeon in the operating room. In response to the limited availability of operating rooms, clinicians from two specialised diabetic foot units per- formed bedside surgery to amputate isolated toe-necrosis-complicated DFU.The aim of our study was to compare the rate of wound healing 6 months after toe amputation following bedside amputation surgery (BAS) and conventional amputation surgery (CAS).

**Materials and methods:**
This restrospective observational multi- center study was conducted in two French diabetic foot units. All patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) who underwent a toe amputation for isolated and delimited necrosis in an operating room (CAS) or at bedside (BAS) were included between May 2016 and July 2023. The primary endpoint was the 6-month healing rate, defined as a complete skin epithelialization without recurrence at 6 months, without second- ary surgery (reamputation).

**Results:**
Out of 2029 patients admitted for DFU, 189 had isolated toe necrosis requiring limited amputation (9%). Among the 171 patients who attended follow-up at six months: 82.5% were males, 94.7% had type 2 diabetes, the average duration of DM was 18.3+/-0.9 years, and the average HbA1c was 8.6+/-2%. BAS was performed on 106/171 (62%) patients. The 6-month healing rate was not significantly different between the two groups (BAS 53.8% vs CAS 52.3%, p=0.852). The rate of secondary surgery was not significantly different in the two groups (BAS 24.5% vs CAS 16.9%, p=0.241), and there was no dif- ference in the rates of further amputation (transtibial amputation: BAS 7.5% vs CAS 3.1%, p=0.227 / complete transmetarsal amputation: BAS 11.3% vs CAS 13.8%, p=0.625).

**Conclusion:**
Bedside amputation surgery is a safe and efficient approach for the treatment of isolated toe necrosis, resulting in a heal- ing rate similar to that of conventional surgery.

**Background and aims:**
Musculoskeletal disorders of the hand, col- lectively known as diabetic hand (DH), are an often overlooked com- plication of diabetes mellitus (DM), despite their functional impact and reduced quality of life. The association between DH and glycae- mic control or other clinical factors remains poorly understood. This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with DH in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), with a focus on the role of chronic hyperglycaemia.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective matched case-control study at a University Hospital. From a cohort of 968 adults with T1DM, 45 DH cases were identified. Each case was matched to two controls (n=90) based on age, sex, diabetes duration and presence of retinopathy using propensity scores. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was applied to assess associations with DH.

**Results:**
DH prevalence was 4.6% (n=45/968). Patients with DH had significantly higher HbA1c compared to controls (8.03 ± 1.3% vs. 7.6 ± 1.0%; p=0.038). Cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in DH cases (20.2% vs. 2.2%; p=0.005), as was the use of high-intensity lipid- lowering therapy (30.0% vs. 8.9%; p=0.006). In multivariable analysis, only HbA1c (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.16-3.28; p=0.011) and age (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01-1.12; p=0.012) remained independently associated with DH. No significant associations were found with nephropathy, retin- opathy or CGM-derived glycaemic variability.

**Conclusion:**
In this matched case-control study, poor long-term glycae- mic control, as indicated by elevated HbA1c, was independently associ- ated with the presence of diabetic hand. These findings suggest that DH is a distinct, non-vascular complication of T1DM, more directly related to chronic hyperglycaemia than to traditional vascular or microvascular risk factors. Clinicians should be aware of DH as an early functional complication of suboptimal diabetes control. Further research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms and guide targeted prevention or management strategies.

**Metabolic decompensation parameters as predictors of mortality in diabetic foot patients**

A. Piaggesi

**Background and aims:**
To evaluate the role of the new metabolic decompensation indexes and of anemia as predictors of mortality in a cohort of severely complicated diabetic foot (DF) inpatients.

**Materials and methods:**
We retrospectively analyzed data of all patients admitted to our department for DF in 2021. We collected data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, blood parameters, procedures performed and clinical outcomes, such as healing. At the end of 2024 all patients were contacted to investigate regarding vital status and, in case of death, its date. Patients were then divided into two groups according to whether they were alive (Group A) or dead (Group B). We compared groups for clinical characteristics, blood chemistry, blood crasis and parameters of metabolic severity [Fibrosis 4 (FIB4) index, triglyceride/glucose ratio (TyG)]. We then compared those parameters with mortality rate.

**Results:**
We admitted in the study period 280 patients: 31 of them were not contactable during follow-up and were therefore excluded from this analysis. Of the remaining 249: 160 were in Group A [64.3%, mean age 73.9±9.2 yrs, male/female 74.4/25.6, DM1/2 7.5/92.5%; BMI 29.0±5.1 kg/m2; Hba1c 61.9±18.7 mmol/mol; diabetes duration (DD) 20.2±11.9 years] and 89 in Group B [35.7%, mean age 67.8±11.2 yrs, male/female 66.2/33.8, DM1/2 8.9/91.1%; BMI 27.4±7.7 kg/m2; Hba1c 60.1±15.3 mmol/mol; diabetes duration (DD) 21.4±13.9 years]. Group B were older (p<0.05), had a longer (p<0.001) DD, a higher prevalence of ischemic cardiopathy (p<0.05) and of chronic kidney disease (p<0.05). No differences in levels of total haemoglobin while Group B had higher levels of FIB4 (p<0.05), TYG (p<0.05) and higher levels of creatinine- mia (p<0.05). In Cox logistic regression FIB 4 (HR 1.34, p=0.027), TyG (HR 1.78, p=0.032), ischemic cardiopathy (HR 1.23, p=0.034) and chronic kidney disease (HR 1.33, p=0.028) positively correlated with death. Multivariate regression confirmed only FIB4 (HR 1.87, p<0.02) and TYG (HR 1.34, p<0.001) as predictor of mortality.

**Conclusion:**
Our data demonstrated how metabolic decompensation indexes may predict mortality in DF patients.

**Diabetic foot patients aging and survival over 20 years of activity of a third-level specialized unit**

A. Piaggesi

**Background and aims:**
The aim of our study was to assess whether over the years population of patients attending our Diabetic foot (DF) centre has changed demographically and if this affected long-term survival

**Materials and methods:**
We evaluated patients who have made their first access to our DF centre in 2004 (Group A), in 2014 (Group B) and in 2024 (Group C). We compared Groups in terms of age at first admission, reason for accessing such as primary or secondary preven- tion, acute diabetic foot and the presence of infection, ischemia or neuro-arthropathy. We evaluated therefore for all patient death and date thereof. We analyzed then through regression methods the predictive power of different parameters in terms of mortality rate and time of death

**Results:**
We derived data from 1341 patients: 165 in Group A (12.3%), 716 in Group B (53.4%) and 460 in Group C (34.3%). Age was increasing from Group A (mean 66.3±11.6, median 67.0 yrs) to Group B (mean 69.4±13.0, median 70.5 yrs) and to Group C (mean 70.9±12.6, median 72.0 - p<0.001). In Group A almost all patients accessed due to the presence of ulcers versus about half in the other two groups (93.9% in Group A, 47.1% in Group B, 52.0% in Group C, p<0.001). Only 3% of patient in Group A was in primary prevention versus 46.5% in Group B and 40.4% in Group C (p<0.001). Mor- tality within ten years from first access was significantly higher in Group A versus Group B (53.3% vs 44.1% p<0.001) and we observed also a significant increase in age of death: 74.9±10.1 yrs in Group A, 79.1±12.9 in Group B and 83.2±8.9 in Group C (p<0.001). Logistic regression pointed out a predictive role for death of male sex (OR 1.551, p<0.001), ischemia (OR 2.296, p<0.001) and infection (OR 1.970 p<0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis inversely cor- related the presence of infection at first visit with survival (HR 1.27 - 95%CI 1-01-1.60 - p=0.04).

**Conclusion:**
Over the years, diabetic foot patients have become older, while a decrease in mortality rate was observed. Infection and ischemia appear to be predictors of mortality while infection conditions survival duration.

**Background and aims:**
Amputations in individuals with diabetes mel- litus (DM) is a problem both for the individual and for society. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of amputations at differ- ent levels (hip and femur, knee and below knee and foot and ankle) and the economic burden for society in the Västra Götaland region (VGR), the next largest region in Sweden.

**Materials and methods:**
In this observational retrospective study from VGR, data regarding incidence of amputations and the related costs are analysed. In the VGR, with 1.8 million inhabitants, registra- tions of care occasions are stored in the regional database, the VEGA database. Data regarding amputations occurring for patients with dia- betes were extracted from the database over a six-year period (2015 - 2020). Regional sources regarding care and costs, in a Swedish set- ting, is available, useful for long-term follow-up, evaluation and audit of care as decided by The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR). The SALAR supports the implementation of patient-related cost accounting in healthcare, known as KPP (Kostnad per patient). Based on in-patient hospital registrations the incidence and costs for care related to patients diagnosed with DM and amputa- tions are analysed.

**Results:**
A total of 1794 amputations took place during these six years, 299 amputations per year. Of these the most common level of amputation was knee and below knee (n=118/year), the second most common was foot and ankle (n=98/year) amputations while hip and femur amputations were more rare (n= 82/year) In total, the cost per year for amputations, independent on level, was 64 million SEK (6,4 million euro). The mean cost per year for hip and femur amputations was 21 million SEK (2,1 million euro), 28,9 million SEK (2,9 million euro) for knee and below knee amputations and 14 million SEK (1,4 million euro) for foot and ankle amputations. Over six years 2% of the individuals with DM were affected by an amputation. Men were more affected by amputations than women, in total over six years 1210 ver- sus 584 amputations in women. Particularly, considering the number of men and women with diabetes, foot and ankle amputations were proportionally more common among men, 0,9% versus 0,3% of all individuals with DM.

**Conclusion:**
Amputations are both common and costly and primary care and society should put down a considerable effort to prevent ampu- tations by being observant on early signs of foot ulcers and provide preventive care to all patients with DM, with extra focus on men.

**Background and aims:**
The infection spreading in patients with infected diabetic foot ulcers (iDFU) is preventable by the induction of sufficient serum and peripheral tissue concentrations of applied antibi- otics (ATBs).The impact of peripheral arterial disease on ATB levels in people with iDFU is still unclear. The aim of the DFIATIM trial was to determine the possible impact of circulation parameters on achieved peripheral tissue levels of time-dependent ATBs.

**Materials and methods:**
We have enrolled 60 patients (mean age 65±9 years, BMI 32.7±5.1 kg.m , HbA1c 63±7 mmol/mol), who were treated by intravenous ATBs - ceftazidime (CTZ) or amoxicillin/clavu- lanate acid (AMC) for iDFU. These study subjects were divided into 4 groups based on the type of ATB administration - bolus ­(CTZ , ­AMC ) or continual ­(CTZ , ­AMC ). Macrocirculation sta- tus was determined by ankle-, toe-brachial indexes (ABI, TBI) and occlusive plethysmography (arterial flow, inter-arm distance). Micro- circulation was assessed by transcutaneous oxygen pressure ­(TcPO ). Peripheral tissue ATB levels were assessed via microdialysis and their efficacy by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics determinants.

**Results:**
No significant differences as in parameters of macro- as of microcirculation were detected among study groups (mean ABI 1.15-1.2±0.15-0.36; TBI 0.66±0.26; inter-arm distance 25±3.5 mm; increase of arterial flow 43-76±17.5-29.5 mL.min ; ­TcPO 46±14 mmHg in all study groups). Only slightly positive correlation of increase arterial flow with ATB concentrations in peripheral tissue has been found in patients from ­CTZ group (p=0.079). Patients treated with AMC, especially study subjects from ­AMC group, had positive correlations of tissue ATB concentrations with ABI (p=0.017) and increase of arterial flow (p=0.012), in ­AMC group with TBI only (p= 0.033). Microcirculation did not influence significantly the peripheral tissue ATB levels

**Conclusion:**
DFIATIM trial has shown that in contrast to microcir- culation only parameters of macrocirculation, predominantly amount of arterial flow to lower limbs, significantly influenced the achieved ATB concentrations in peripheral tissue and therefore their efficacy in patients with iDFU.

3. India, Radiodiagnosis, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education

**Background and aims:**
Current modalities for monitoring remission and predicting recurrence of active charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy (CNO) are limited and none has been shown to predict recurrence. The present study evaluates the role of 18F-Sodium Fluoride positron emission tomography / computed tomography (18F-NaF PET/CT) for the diagnosis, monitoring for remission and predicting recurrence of active CNO.

**Materials and methods:**
This prospective study screened eighty patients of diabetes with asymmetric foot swelling. All participants were evaluated with infra-red thermography, magnetic resonance imag- ing (MRI) and F-NaF PET/CT. Standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) on NaF PET/CT was obtained at region of interest (ROI) at baseline, remission, and three-monthly post remission. The baseline SUVmax was compared between individuals with active CNO on MRI and those without. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine a discriminatory threshold for diagnosing active CNO. Participants diagnosed with active CNO were monitored until remission and beyond clinical remission to evaluate any potential recur- rence. The recurrence risk for active CNO was analyzed using logistics regression analysis.

**Results:**
Thirty-nine patients meeting inclusion were evaluated and 33 had active CNO. The median SUVmax was 55.1 in active CNO compared to 7.5 in those with cellulitis (p<0.001). SUVmax of 11.9 had 97% sensitivity and 50% specificity for the diagnosis of active CNO (AUC: 0.947, p=0.001). Twenty-nine participants achieved remission and median SUVmax decreased from 58.3 to 19.6 (p<0.001) (61.9% reduction) at remission. Four patients relapsed at three months post- remission. All the four patients had a significantly lower SUVmax reduction from baseline (28.4% vs. 64.7%, p=0.006). A 64% reduction in SUVmax from baseline independently predicted sustained remission (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.941-0.999, p=0.046).

**Conclusion:**
A F-NaF PET/CT SUVmax of 11.9 demonstrated high accuracy for the diagnosis of active CNO of foot. A reduction in SUV- max of 64% from baseline strongly predicts sustained remission of active CNO.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) significantly increase morbidity and mortality among patients with diabetes. Mal- nutrition is highly prevalent in this population and may further worsen outcomes, but its impact on survival and amputation rates remains understudied. This study aimed to assess the effect of malnutrition, defined by the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, on survival and amputation risk in patients hospitalized for a DFU.

**Materials and methods:**
Clinical records from patients admitted to the University Hospital Antwerp (Belgium) for DFU complications between June 2016 and June 2024 were retrospectively analyzed (follow-up until December 2024). Malnutrition was assessed upon admission using the GLIM criteria. Survival differences were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, as well as Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, DFU severity and comorbidities. Similarly, a Fine- Gray model was analyzed for competing risks of amputation and survival.

**Results:**
A total of 222 patients (mean age 69 ± 12 years, 79% male) were included; 35% were malnourished. The survival probability for the entire population at 5 years post follow-up was 62%. Survival dis- tributions did not significantly differ between the malnourished and non-malnourished group (p =.607). Time to first amputation (minor or major) and time to first major amputation after inclusion also did not significantly differ between both groups (p=.95 and p=.78 respectively).

**Conclusion:**
Our study found no significant impact of malnutrition on survival or amputation risk. These findings suggest that other factors, such as cardiovascular disease, play a more dominant role in determin- ing these outcomes. All patients received nutritional support as part of standard care, which may have mitigated potential negative effects of malnutrition and influenced our results. Further research is needed to explore the role of malnutrition and nutritional support in DFU heal- ing and long-term outcomes. Figure: Bold lines show Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (A) and cumulative incidence functions of amputation after adjusting for death as competing risk (B) for both the malnourished and non-malnourished group. Dashed lines show cor- responding confidence intervals.

**Background and aims:**
The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial demon- strated reduction in cardiovascular events with alirocumab in patients after acute coronary syndromes with or without diabetes. We evaluated the impact of alirocumab on acute ischemic events and mortality in individuals with or without diabetes and with atherosclerotic cardio- vascular disease (ASCVD) and no prior acute ischemic events.

**Materials and methods:**
Using the Optum Research Database (2016- 2022), we identified individuals with ASCVD but without prior myo- cardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke. The population was stratified based on diabetes status. In each group, patients initiating alirocumab were matched with those who did not initiate PCSK9i (mAb or siRNA) via propensity score. The primary endpoint was a composite of non- fatal MI, nonfatal ischemic stroke, or all-cause mortality. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), a doubly robust estimator of causal effect, was used to evaluate the relative risk reduction (RRR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) over 2 years via a per-protocol analysis.

**Results:**
A total of 1,056 diabetes and 2,245 no-diabetes patients ini- tiating alirocumab were selected. They were matched, respectively, with 2,111 and 4,490 individuals who did not initiate PCSK9i. Base- line characteristics were well balanced between the alirocumab groups and controls. In individuals with and without diabetes, respectively, mean age was 68.3 and 66.6 years; 49.4% and 56.5% were male; 77.5% and 71.7% had coronary disease; 7.6% and 9.2% had cerebrovascular disease; 13.8% and 11.7% had peripheral artery disease; mean LDL cholesterol was 122.4 mg/dL and 129.9 mg/dL; baseline statin use was 55.0% and 56.0%. In individuals with and without diabetes, respec- tively, the TMLE-estimated RRR with alirocumab vs. no-PCSK9i over 2 years was 49.5% and 42.3%; and the estimated ARR over 2 years was 7.1% and 3.3% (all p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Treatment with alirocumab was associated with signifi- cantly lower acute ischemic events or mortality in patients with or without diabetes and with ASCVD and no prior acute ischemic events, with greater relative and absolute reduction in events in individuals with diabetes.

6. Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA, Joslin Diabetes

**Background and aims:**
We previously demonstrated that genetic vari- ability in the PPARA region affects the effectiveness of the PPAR-α agonist fenofibrate in managing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dia- betic retinopathy (DR) progression, even in individuals without ath- erogenic dyslipidemia. Evidence suggests that higher genetically deter- mined PPARA expression, as reflected by the Genetic Score (eQtGS), may enhance fenofibrate’s benefit. In this pharmacogenetic trial, we aimed to assess whether PPARA eQtGS influences fenofibrate’s impact on lipid and apolipoprotein profiles in statin-treated individuals with well-controlled lipid levels.

**Materials and methods:**
We enrolled adult patients with type 2 dia- betes who were on stable statin therapy, with LDL-C <100 mg/dL, tri- glycerides <200 mg/dL, HbA1c <8%, and eGFR >60 mL/min. Patients were randomized to receive either fenofibrate or placebo for 12 weeks (1:1). Lipid profile, apolipoproteins, transaminases, creatinine, CPK, and CRP were assessed. The eQtGS was derived from the publicly available EyeGEx database, using PPARA retinal expression data, and was found to correlate positively with PPARA expression in RNAseq experiments from whole blood (eQTLgen Consortium data).

**Results:**
A total of 180 subjects (mean age: 66 years, 23% female, 33% obese, 23% with prior CAD, HbA1c: 6.6%) completed the study. All participants were on statins, with mean LDL-C at 62 mg/dL and tri- glycerides at 102 mg/dL. Fenofibrate significantly reduced triglycerides (-20.7 mg/dL) and ApoCIII (-1.56 mg/dL), while increasing LDL-C (+4.62 mg/dL), ApoAII (+8.5 mg/dL), and creatinine (+0.14 mg/dL, all p<0.05). At baseline, each 1-S.D. increase in PPARA eQtGS was nominally associated with higher levels of total- and LDL-cholesterol (+4.6 mg/dL and +2.7 mg/dL, respectively, all p<0.05), as well as higher ApoAI (+1.9 mg/dL, p=0.04). After adjusting for these base- line differences, we found that PPARA eQtGS significantly modulated fenofibrate’s effects on LDL-C and ApoB levels, with higher PPARA eQtGS associated with lower levels of LDL-C and ApoB post-treat- ment. A significant positive interaction between eQtGS and fenofibrate was also observed for transaminase elevations. No differences in cre- atinine levels were found.

**Conclusion:**
These precision medicine findings support the concept that genetically determined PPARA expression influences fenofibrate response, providing further evidence for using genetic variants to iden- tify individuals who may derive greater benefit from this treatment. However, the modest differences observed in lipid profiles are unlikely to fully explain the large effects of fenofibrate on CVD and DR across genetically diverse populations. Further research is needed to explore additional mechanisms and tissue-specific eQtGS.

3. Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea, Daegu Catholic University

**Background and aims:**
Lipid-lowering drugs are known to cause various muscle-related side effects; however, evidence regarding their association with muscle mass reduction is limited. This study aimed to investigate the association between the use of lipid-lowering drugs and muscle mass, as well as the prevalence of sarcopenia, using nationally representative data.

**Materials and methods:**
This cross-sectional study used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2008-2011. A total of 18,668 adults aged ≥20 years who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and had documented lipid- lowering drug use were included. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was defined as the sum of lean soft tissue mass in the arms and legs measured by DXA. ASM was normalized by body weight (ASM/ wt) for analysis.

**Results:**
Participants were categorized into three groups: no hyper- lipidemia, hyperlipidemia without medication, and hyperlipidemia with medication. Compared to those without hyperlipidemia, indi- viduals with hyperlipidemia had significantly lower ASM/wt (Figure A and D). After adjusting for confounders (age, height, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, FBG, eGFR, 25(OH)D , daily intake of total calo- ries, protein, and fat, past history of DM and HTN, smoking history, physical activity, and menopause (in women), and lipid profiles), no significant difference was observed between the untreated hyperlipi- demia group and the general population. However, those taking lipid- lowering drugs had significantly lower ASM/wt (Figure C and F, < 0.01). The prevalence of sarcopenia was also higher in this group (OR = 2.89 [95% CI 1.95-4.28] in men, < 0.01; OR = 1.68 [1.26- 2.24] in women, < 0.01). Among medicated patients, duration of hyperlipidemia was linearly associated with reduced ASM/wt (B = -0.069 in men, < 0.01; B = -0.085 in women, < 0.01) and higher sarcopenia prevalence (OR = 1.12 [1.04-1.21] per year in men, < 0.01; OR = 1.08 [1.01-1.15] per year in women, = 0.02). These trends were not observed in untreated hyperlipidemic individuals.

**Conclusion:**
Lipid-lowering drug use was associated with reduced skeletal muscle mass and a higher prevalence of sarcopenia. These findings suggest a potential adverse effect of such medications on muscle health and highlight the need for monitoring muscle mass in long-term users.

**Dapagliflozin does not reduce LDL catabolism but modifies VLDL catabolism in a more physiological way, in patients with type 2 diabetes**

1. Dijon University Hospital, Dijon, France, Ctm-umr1231, INSERM,

**Background and aims:**
Some animal data have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors may decrease the catabolism of LDL, by reducing the hepatic expression of LDL-receptors. However, the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on LDL metabolism, and more widely on all apoB-con- taining lipoproteins remain unknown in humans. This prompted us to study the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, on the metabolism of apoB100 containing lipoproteins, in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

**Materials and methods:**
We performed an in vivo kinetic study with stable isotopes (tri-deuterated L-leucine) in 18 T2DM patients before and after 6-month treatment with dapagliflozine (10mg/day) or placebo, given after randomization. This was a double-blinded study in which 12 patients received dapagliflozin and 6 placebo.

**Results:**
Compared with placebo-treated patients, those who received dapagliflozin showed a significant reduction of body weight (87.2±7.88 vs. 91.1±8.15 kg, p=0.0001) and HbA1c (7.87±1.09 vs. 8.65±1.51 %, p=0.001). Plasma triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels were not significantly modified by dapa- gliflozin. LDL-apoB fractional catabolism remained unchanged after dapagliflozin treatment (0.92 ± 0.41 vs. 0.84 ± 0.27 pool/day, p=0.53). Similarly, no significant modification of LDL-apoB pool or LDL-apoB production rate was observed. However, dapagliflozin modified significantly the metabolism of ­VLDL -apoB by reducing its direct catabolism (0.46±0.73 vs. 2.28±2.25 pool/day, p=0.012) and increasing the “more physiological” indirect catabolism towards ­VLDL and IDL (2.74±1.58. vs. 1.76±1.39 pool/day, p=0.015).

**Conclusion:**
Dapagliflozin does not modify the catabolism of LDL in patients with T2D. It modifies the catabolism of ­VLDL by reducing its direct catabolism and by increasing its indirect catabolism towards ­VLDL and IDL, which is more physiological.

**Background and aims:**
This study aims to evaluate the effect of cumu- lative burden of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on cardio- vascular risk in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who have no preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD), using nationwide data.

**Materials and methods:**
This study retrospectively evaluated data from approximately 2,616,828 Korean patients with T2DM who par- ticipated in the national health screening program during the 2015- 2016 period. The data were collected from Korean National Health Insurance Service claim records up to 2022. A total of 300,449 patients were ultimately included in the study, with cumulative LDL-C expo- sure categorized from 0 to 4 based on the number of laboratory results showing LDL-C levels of ≥130 mg/dL. The primary outcomes were cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death, assessed according to the degree of LDL-C exposure.

**Results:**
In fully adjusted model (Model 5 including statin, drug use, and lifestyle), patients with the highest LDL-C exposure (category 4) exhibited a significantly increased risk of CVD (hazard ratios (HR) 1.57, 95% CI 1.46-1.69) compared to the reference group (category 0). A dose-dependent increase in risk was observed across exposure categories. The strongest association was observed for MI, with a 74% higher risk in the highest exposure group (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.58-1.91). A progressive rise in risk was evident across exposure levels also. The stroke incidence rate remained relatively stable across categories, rang- ing from 3.00 to 3.28 per 1,000 person-years. However, individuals in the highest exposure group showed a significantly elevated risk (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.25-1.55). Interestingly, patients with the highest LDL-C exposure did not have significantly increased risk of cardiovascular death in fully adjusted model (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87-1.06) compared to the reference group though the confidence interval included 1.0, suggesting a lack of statistical significance.

**Conclusion:**
In this nationwide cohort study, higher cumulative LDL-C exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of CVD, MI, and stroke in a dose-dependent manner. Cardiovascular mortality did not increase with higher LDL-C exposure and the reason needs to be elucidated.

**Background and aims:**
CLEAR Outcomes showed cardiovas- cular (CV) risk reduction with bempedoic acid (BA) in diabetes, but real-world data is limited. We aimed to analyze effect of BA/ BA+ezetimibe (BA/BA+EZE) in patients with/without diabetes from 4 EU countries in the real-world MILOS study.

**Materials and methods:**
MILOS, a prospective European study, assesses BA/BA+EZE effectiveness and safety in hypercholester- olemia/mixed dyslipidemia. Patients were stratified by glycemic status: diabetes, prediabetes, or normoglycemia. Pre-treatment and interim 8-week follow-up (8W) LDL-C data were analyzed.

**Results:**
Pooled data from 2121 patients (Austria, 200; Belgium, 375; Italy, 1310; UK, 236) were analyzed. Of these, 18.6% had diabetes, 21.2% had pre-diabetes, 58.2% had normoglycemia and 2.0% had missing diabetes status. Overall, patients were often male; those with diabetes and prediabetes had higher BMI (>30 kg/m ). Investigator-classified high/very-high CV risk (%): diabetes (23.9/63.9), prediabetes (29.0/55.1) and normoglycemia (30.2/48.3). Before BA/BA+EZE initiation, about one-third patients were not on lipid lowering therapies (LLTs) (diabetes: 32.5%; prediabetes: 31.3%, normoglycemia: 35.1%), one-third received monotherapy (diabetes: 35.0%; prediabetes: 35.6%, normoglycemia: 33.8%) and one-third received combination therapy (diabetes: 32.5%; predia- betes: 33.1%, normoglycemia: 31.1%). LDL-C at pre-treatment and 8W were available for 1081 patients (16.9% diabetes, 19.9% predia- betes, 61.2% normoglycemia and 2% with missing diabetes status). Mean (SD) pre-treatment LDL-C levels were lower in patients with diabetes vs prediabetes and normoglycemia (102.8 [45.8] vs 115.7 [49.7] and 115.0 [47.4] mg/dL, respectively). After 8W of treatment with BA/BA+EZE, mean (SD) LDL-C for patients with diabetes, prediabetes and normoglycemia were reduced to 83.1 (34.7), 76.3 (32.4), and 76.1 (42.5) mg/dL, respectively. LDL-C goal attainment from pre-treatment to 8W increased across all groups (diabetes: 4.9% to 39.3%; prediabetes: 6.1% to 40.9%, normoglycemia: 8.9% to 36.7%).

**Conclusion:**
MILOS data from 4 countries showed that adding BA/ BA+EZE for 8 weeks, with or without other LLTs, led to ~7-fold increase in the proportion of diabetes and prediabetes patients achieving their LDL-C goal.

**Background and aims:**
Tissue turnover in the human heart requires the recruitment of multipotent cardiac progenitor cells (hCPC). Defec- tive hCPC number and pro-angiogenic capacity contribute to diabetes- and obesity-related heart failure in humans. Evidence supports benefi- cial cardiovascular effects of dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists such as tirzepatide. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether hCPC express functional GLP-1R, GIPR, and to investigate the ability of the GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide to prevent palmitate-induces apoptosis, autophagy, and senescence in hCPC.

**Materials and methods:**
hCPC were obtained from right auricle biop- sies of non-obese, non-diabetic subjects undergoing elective cardiac surgery. GLP-1R and GIPR mRNA and protein expression were dem- onstrated by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respec- tively. hCPC were exposed to 100 nM tirzepatide for different times. hCPC, pretreated or not with 100 nM tirzepatide for 1 h, were exposed to 0.25 mM palmitate for 16 h. CREB phosphorylation was evaluated by immunoblotting. Apoptosis, autophagy and senescence, were evalu- ated by cleaved caspase-3, LC3-II and ­p21 immunoblotting, respectively.

**Results:**
hCPC express both functional GLP-1R and GIPR. Exposure of hCPC to tirzepatide for 5 min activeted CREB signaling (p<0.05). Treatment of hCPC with palmitate induced apoptosis, autophagy and senescence (p<0.05). Pretreatment of hCPC with tirzepatide prevented palmitate-induced apoptosis, autophagy and senescence (p<0.05). Con- versely, the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 prevented palmitate-induced apoptosis and autophagy, whereas GIP prevented apoptosis, but not autophagy.

**Conclusion:**
hCPC express functional GLP-1R and GIPR. Tirzepatide prevents palmitate-induced apoptosis, autophagy, and senescence of hCPC. Hence, in humans, pharmacological targeting through GLP- 1R and GIPR might produce beneficial cardiovascular effects that go beyond glucose control and weight loss.

**Blocking of mineralocorticoid signalling reduces atherosclerosis in hyperglycaemia-induced ApoE knockout mice without altering glycolipid metabolism**

H. Iwamoto, M. Shimoda, S. Nakanishi, T. Mune, K. Kaku, H. Kaneto

**Background and aims:**
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is acti- vated in blood vessels with atherosclerosis, and its antagonist leads to the suppression of atherosclerosis and nephrosclerosis independently of hypertension. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade also dem- onstrates cardioprotective and renoprotective effects, but its effects on atherosclerosis remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether blocking mineralocorticoid signaling with esaxerenone, a non-steroidal MR blocker, exerts anti-atherosclerotic effects and to clarify its molecular mechanism.

**Materials and methods:**
ApoE KO mice were used as a model of ath- erosclerosis, with both non-diabetic and drug-induced diabetic models created using low-dose streptozotocin. The mice were divided into a control group and an esaxerenone group, with the latter receiving a mixed diet (0.03%, 3 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks starting at 10 weeks of age. We evaluated blood glucose levels, metabolic markers (lipids), mRNA expression in the aorta, and plaque area in the aortic arch. Additionally, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were used to assess the direct effects of esaxerenone.

**Results:**
In the non-diabetic ApoE KO model, where atherosclerosis was mild, no significant effect of esaxerenone was observed. However, in the diabetic ApoE KO model, esaxerenone administration did not affect blood pressure, serum triglycerides, or serum total cholesterol levels. Surprisingly, a significant reduction in the plaque area in the aortic arch was observed in the esaxerenone-treated group compared to the control group (plaque area: 0.24 vs. 0.17, P = 0.0059). This reduc- tion in plaque formation was accompanied by a marked decrease in inflammation-related markers, including the macrophage marker, cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1), and oxidative stress markers. Specifically, the urinary oxidative stress marker, 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxy- guanosine (8-OHdG), was significantly lower in the esaxerenone group, suggesting a reduction in oxidative damage. In vitro experiments using human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) treated with LPS dem- onstrated that esaxerenone (100 nM) significantly reduced the expres- sion of key pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β) and adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1).

**Conclusion:**
Blocking of mineralocorticoid signaling by esaxerenone exerts anti-atherosclerotic effects through the direct modulation of inflammatory pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells, without impacting blood pressure or glycolipid metabolism. The reduction in plaque formation in the aortic arch is likely driven by the attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation-related signaling pathways. These findings suggest that MR blockade with esaxerenone may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis, particularly in the context of diabetes, through its molecular action on vascular smooth muscle cells and inflammatory mechanisms.

**Background and aims:**
In individuals with diabetes, concordance between LDL-C estimating equations and direct enzymatic assays is lower. Previous studies have shown that the Martin-Hopkins (MH) equation offers better alignment with direct measurement than the Friedewald (F) equation. In our prior analysis of an entire population of inpatients enrolled in the timeframe 2021-2022, we found that LDL-C target achievement declines progressively in higher-risk categories, with only 32.1% of diabetic patients reaching their LDL-C targets.

**Materials and methods:**
Retrospective real-world data were extracted from the Hospital Information System using automated data extraction strategies and stored in a patient-centered repository (the Dyslipidemia Data Mart). Patients were excluded if triglycerides were >400 mg/dl. LDL-C was calculated using both the MH and F equations, and Pearson correlation was performed. Differences in LDL-C (ΔLDL-C) between the two equations were calculated for the entire population, as well as for the diabetic and non-diabetic subgroups. LDL-C target achievement was assessed based on the 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines.

**Results:**
A total of 13,834 patients were included, 30.5% of whom had diabetes. The Pearson correlation between MH and F equations was 0.99 (p < 1×10 ¹ ). Mean LDL-C values were consistently higher with the MH equation. ΔLDL-C (MH-F) was 2.66 mg/dl, 2.16 mg/dl and 3.78 mg/dl for the entire population, non-diabetic subgroup and diabetic subgroup, respectively (p <0.001). Overall, on-target patients were 35.8% with MH compared to 38.9% with F. The percentage of on-target patients (according to F) reclassified as off-target (according to MH) was significantly higher in diabetics compared to non-diabetics (5.1% vs 2.8%, p<0.001). Distance-to-target (DTT) was also higher with MH, particularly among diabetics (3.8 mg/dL vs 2.2 mg/dL in non-diabetics, p < 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Accurate LDL-C estimation is critical in the cardiovas- cular risk management of diabetic patients. The choice of calculation method can significantly influence both target achievement and subse- quent therapeutic decisions, with the Martin-Hopkins equation identi- fying a larger proportion of diabetic patients as off-target compared to the Friedewald equation.

4. USA, Department of Internal Medicine and Diabetology, Poznan

**Background and aims:**
People with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) are char- acterized by high serum HDL concentration, which does not translate into a better cardiovascular (CVD) prognosis. It is probably related to the impaired function of HDL particles. One of the main functions of HDL is the anti-atherosclerotic role related to reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages in arterial walls (cholesterol efflux capac- ity-CEC). CEC is a proven CVD risk factor. However, its prospective changes in the T1DM population are understudied. The study aimed to explore the CEC relationship with the management of diabetes and features of insulin resistance in adults with newly diagnosed T1DM.

**Materials and methods:**
84 participants (F/M: 35/49) of the Insulin Therapy and Lipoproteins Profile in Type 1 Diabetes (InLipoDiab1) study had CEC measured at baseline (at onset of T1DM) and after 12 months. CEC was assessed by measuring the efflux radiolabelled cho- lesterol from murine J774 macrophages to apolipoprotein B-depleted serum. Body composition was assessed with bioimpendancy (TAN- ITA). Mixed-effects models (MEM) analysed associations between CEC and HbA1c, lipid profile, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist circum- ference (WC), fat-to-muscle ratio (FMR) and body fat proportion (BF).

**Results:**
Mean age at onset was 26.6±5.8 years, and mean baseline: HbA1c 11.1±1.9%. Inferential statistics (results given as MEM coef- ficients (95%CI)) were performed. Compared to the baseline, CEC significantly increased at 12 month (0.09(0.04, 0.14), p=0.001). After adjustment for visit, CEC was associated with WC: -10.27(-17.82, -2.71), p=0.008 and WHR -0.09(-0.16, -0.03), p=0.003). Moreover CEC was associated with HDL-cholesterol 0.54(0.24, 0.85), p=0.001 and LDL-cholesterol -0.69(-1.10, -0.28), p=0.001. There were no asso- ciations between CEC and sex, baseline age, HbA1c, FMR and BF.

**Conclusion:**
CEC improves with treatment and is associated with indi- rect markers of insulin resistance and lipid profile in newly diagnosed T1DM. The higher WC and WHR the worse CEC.

**Background and aims:**
Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically deter- mined lipoprotein linked to atherothrombosis and progressive renal dys- function. While elevated Lp(a) has been recognized as an independent cardiovascular risk factor, its impact on long-term cardiorenal outcomes among patients with diabetes mellitus remains poorly characterized. This study aimed to investigate the association between Lp(a) levels and major renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network, encompassing data from 100 healthcare organizations. Adult patients with diabetes mellitus and a recorded Lp(a) value were included and stratified into two cohorts: Lp(a) ≥31 mg/dL (Cohort 1) and Lp(a) ≤30 mg/dL (Cohort 2). Propen- sity score matching was applied (1:1) based on demographics, comor- bidities, and relevant laboratory values, yielding 10,479 patients per group. Outcomes assessed over a 5-year period included chronic kidney disease (CKD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, proteinuria, and all-cause mortality. Risk estimates were calculated using risk ratios, odds ratios, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

**Results:**
Following matching, patients with elevated Lp(a) demon- strated significantly higher risks of CKD (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.08- 1.28; <0.001), MI (RR 1.17; 95% CI 1.06-1.30; =0.002), and pro- teinuria (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.00-1.25; =0.049), compared to those with lower Lp(a) levels. No significant differences were observed in risk of stroke (RR 0.95; =0.239) or mortality (RR 0.90; =0.074). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed increased event rates for CKD and MI among the elevated Lp(a) cohort ( <0.01 for both).

**Conclusion:**
In a large, real-world diabetic population, Lp(a) levels ≥31 mg/dL were associated with increased long-term risk of CKD, MI, and proteinuria, independent of traditional risk factors. These findings suggest Lp(a) as a clinically relevant biomarker for risk stratification in diabetes, warranting consideration for routine measurement and potential therapeutic targeting.

**Background and aims:**
The function of the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis may influence bariatric surgery outcomes. This retrospec- tive longitudinal cohort study investigated the correlation between pre- operative plasma cortisol concentration after a 1mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and post-bariatric surgery metabolic parameters in obese patients.

**Materials and methods:**
We enrolled 67 prediabetic patients (72% female, mean age 48±10 years) with grade III obesity or complicated grade II obesity showing clinical signs of hypercortisolism. Patients underwent bariatric surgery (72% sleeve gastrectomy, 16% Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 8% other procedures) and had a pre-operative DST. Meta- bolic parameters were assessed at baseline and 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-months post-surgery. Linear regression analyses evaluated associations between pre-operative cortisol levels and changes in metabolic parameters.

**Results:**
Pre-operative cortisol levels after DST showed complex asso- ciations with post-bariatric surgery metabolic outcomes. For every 1 mcg/dl increase in baseline cortisol, there was a 1.479 mg/dl smaller reduction in glucose levels at 12 months (p=0.037, R²=0.105), sug- gesting resistance to metabolic benefits. This relationship weakened when adjusted for age and sex. BMI changes showed no significant associations during the first year but trended toward greater reduction with higher cortisol at 24 months. Lipid profiles demonstrated signifi- cant improvements: total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides showed negative associations at 6 and 12 months. HDL displayed a unique biphasic pattern with positive trends at 3 months and a significant posi- tive association at 24 months. Patients with normal cortisol suppression (cortisol < 1.8 mcg/dl) showed greater reductions in glucose at 12 months (p=0.048) and triglycerides at 6 months (p=0.014).

**Conclusion:**
The study reveals a complex interplay between cortisol and metabolic outcomes following bariatric surgery. Pre-operative cor- tisol levels may serve as valuable predictors of metabolic responses, guiding personalized post-operative monitoring strategies. The observed differences in glucose and triglyceride reductions between groups with normal and abnormal cortisol suppression underscore the importance of pre-operative cortisol assessment. These findings highlight the need for further research to fully understand the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in bariatric surgery out- comes and its potential implications for tailored patient management.

**Obesity and higher HbA levels are independently associated with impaired cholesterol uptake capacity of HDL in patients with type 2 diabetes**

2. Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan, Department of

**Background and aims:**
HDL plays a protective role in the progres- sion of atherosclerosis by accepting cholesterol from macrophages in the arterial wall. Previous epidemiological studies have shown that HDL dysfunction, particularly impaired cholesterol efflux or uptake capacity of HDL, increases the risk of atherosclerotic CVD. Abnormal glucose homeostasis is thought to impair HDL function through glycation, oxidation, and carbamylation of HDL. The aim of this study is to investigate independent determinants of impaired cholesterol uptake capacity (CUC) of HDL among various clinical factors in patients with type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Serum CUC levels were measured by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay using an automated ana- lyzer (HI-1000, Sysmex Corporation, Japan) in randomly selected 860 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 62.8 ± 9.4 years, 63.9% men) enrolled in the BioBank Japan Cohort Study, which is one of the large-scale biobanks in Japan. Patients with a history of CVD or malignancy were excluded from the analysis. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed as ­HbA ≥ 6.5% or use of antidiabetic medications including insulin. The CUC in pooled serum from healthy individu- als was defined as 100 A.U., and the CUC measured in this study was expressed as a relative value to that obtained from the pooled serum. Impaired CUC was defined as CUC < 80 A.U., which rep- resents the lowest quartile of the present population. The intra- and inter-observer CV of this assay is reported to be < 5% and < 10%, respectively. Cross-sectional associations between CUC and various clinical variables were examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. This study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave informed consent to participate in the BioBank Japan Cohort Study.

**Results:**
The mean CUC level was 102.2 ± 35.4 A.U. (range: 30.2- 298.8 A.U.). A significant but moderate correlation was observed between serum HDL cholesterol and CUC levels (r = 0.66, p < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/ m ; OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.11) and higher ­HbA level (OR 1.15 per 1% increase, 95% CI 1.02-1.29) were significantly associated with an impaired CUC, after adjusting for several other demographic, lifestyle and clinical factors such as age, sex, current smoking, regular exercise, habitual alcohol consumption, medication for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and/or hypertension, C-reactive protein, and diagnosis of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and/or low HDL cholesterolemia. When BMI was used instead of obesity in the analyses, the results were virtually identical to those for obesity.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrated that obesity and higher ­HbA levels were independent determinants of impaired CUC. These findings suggest the importance of both body weight and glycemic con- trol in maintaining HDL function to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
A decreased plasma concentration of high- density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and impaired HDL function in type 2 diabetic subjects are implicated in increased cardiovascular risk. The glycation of HDL by the reactive glucose-derived metabo- lite methylglyoxal (MGO) may be an explanation for this increased HDL degradation and impairments of HDL functionality. MGO modification of HDL occurs mainly on apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which is the main protein component of HDL. Since the effects of MGO modification of HDL on inflammation are still unknown, we aimed to investigate this in the current study.

**Materials and methods:**
Native human apoA-I was modified with highly purified MGO . Glycation modification was quanti- fied using matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) were pre-treated with 10 μg/mL apoA-I or MGO-modified apoA-I for 24 hours, followed by a stimulation with 1 ng/mL LPS for 6 hours. Inflammation was assessed using ELISA and qPCR. To study the effects of MGO-modified apoA-I on innate immune memory, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) was used to ini- tiate innate training in primary human monocytes with or without apoA-I or MGO-modified apoA-I. After 6 days of rest, cells were restimulated with LPS for 24 hours, and inflammatory markers were assessed using ELISA.

**Results:**
Mass spectrometry showed that modification of apoA-I by MGO occurred on arginine residues, mostly at R160 (42% by 1mM MGO and 83% by 10 mM MGO) and to a lesser extent at R131 (0.6% by 1 mM MGO and 1.4% by 10 mM MGO). Pre-treat- ment of HMDMs with apoA-I significantly inhibited LPS-induced inflammation as indicated by reduced IL-6 and TNF levels (TNF: from 3015 ± 980 to 128 ± 73, IL-6: 1223 ± 275 to 321 ± 83 pg/mL, for both <0.05), with similar trends at the gene level. This anti-inflam- matory effect of apoA-I was not attenuated by MGO-modified apoA-I. In the innate training model, apoA-I demonstrated an inhibitory poten- tial on oxLDL-induced TNF expression (fold change: 1.37 ± 0.18 to 0.80 ± 0.03). Interestingly, this effect of apoA-I was reversed by MGO modification (TNF fold change: 0.80 ± 0.03 to 1.73 ± 0.32, <0.05), which even further enhanced oxLDL-induced innate training. Moreo- ver, the promoting effect of MGO-modified apoA-I on innate training appears to be unique to TNF, since no similar effect was observed for IL-6 or CCL2.

**Conclusion:**
MGO modification of apoA-I has no direct effect on acute inflammation but may promote oxLDL-induced innate immune memory

1. University of Pisa and Livorno Hospital, Pisa, Livorno, Italy, Univer-
3. sity of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, Livorno Hospital, Livorno, Italy, Sant’Anna

**Background and aims:**
hs-CRP is a well-established marker of inflam- mation and a relevant player of residual CV risk. HDL-C reverses cholesterol transport and modulates inflammation, showing an inverse correlation with CV risk. As hs-CRP and HDL-C are extensively used, the aim of this observational, prospective study was to evaluate the association of hs-CRP/HDL-C ratio with incidence of CV events and all-cause death in a cohort of T2D over a 13-year follow-up.

**Materials and methods:**
Vital status and data for CV events (avail- able for 98.5% of subjects) were retrieved in 961 subjects with T2D on December ­31 , 2017. hsCRP/HDL-C ratio levels [calculated as: hsCRP (mg/dL)/HDL (mg/dL)] were divided by tertiles (T1 as reference).

**Results:**
Tertiles did not differ for age, age at DM diagnosis, LDL-C, and smoking. DD and eGFR decreased from T1 to T3; BMI, HbA1c, systolic BP, triglycerides, non-HDL-C, uACR, fibrinogen, rate of hypertension and dyslipidemia increased steeply. Peripheral neuropa- thy (DPN), retinopathy (DR), and prior CVD did not increase across tertiles, while DKD did. hsCRP and HDL-C steeply increased and decreased, respectively. We registered 229 deaths (23.8%), 273 major CV events (28.8%), 181 coronary events (CHD: 19.1%), 82 hospitaliza- tions for heart failure (hHF: 8.7%), 101 cerebrovascular events (CVE: 10.7%), 39 peripheral artery diseases (PAD: 4.1%), and 71 ESKD (7.5%). Across hsCRP/HDL-C ratio tertiles, all-cause death increased from 20.0 to 29.1% (K-M, p=0.018), major CV events from 27.2 to 32.1% (K-M, p=0.146), CHD from 15.5 to 22.9% (K-M, p=0.043), and ESRD from 4.7 to 9.8% (K-M, p=0.036), with no differences for CVE, hHF, and PAD. By Cox regression, hsCRP/HDL-C ratio tertiles were associated with all-cause death with HR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.21-2.30, p=0.002) for T3 vs T1 in Model 1 (M1, adjusted by age and sex), of 1.70 (1.23-2.35, p=0.001) in M2 (M1 plus DD and HbA1c), 1.68 (1.22- 2.32, p=0.001) in M3 (M2 plus smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia), 1.48 (1.07-2.05, p=0.018) in M4 (M3 plus uACR, eGFR, DPN, DR), and 1.43 (1.03-1.99, p=0.031) in M5 (M4 plus prior CVD). hsCRP/ HDL-C ratio T3 was associated with incidence of major CV events with an HR of 1.46 (1.09-1.95, p=0.011) in M1, of 1.49 (1.11-2.00, p=0.007) in M2, 1.38 (1.02-1.85, p=0.035) in M3 and 1.41 (1.05-1.89, p=0.023) in M4. Consistently, hsCRP/HDL-C ratio T3 was associated with incidence of CHD with an HR of 1.77 (1.23-2.56, p=0.002) in M1, of 1.87 (1.29-2.69, p=0.001) in M2, 1.75 (1.21-2.53, p=0.003) in M3 and 1.77 (1.23-2.57, p=0.002) in M4. In M5, hsCRP/HDL-C ratio was excluded as an independent covariate of major CV events, but not of CHD with an HR of T3 vs T1 of 1.63 (1.12-2.37, p=0.011). Con- sistent trends in HRs were observed for hHF (marginally significant) and ESRD (significant for both T2 and T3 vs T1) up to M3, with no associations at all for CVE and PAD in any model.

**Conclusion:**
Thus, the hs-CRP/HDL-C ratio is an independent risk factor for death and CV events, mainly coronary events, among adults with T2D. Paying attention to people with elevated hs-CRP/HDL-C ratio would result in CV risk reduction.

**The correlation analysis between trajectory patterns of triglyc- eride-glucose index and its combination with obesity index and ASCVD in patients with type 2 diabetes**

L. Men

**Background and aims:**
The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a sim- ple effective tool to evaluate IR. It has been confirmed to be associated with the cardiovascular events. However, studies related to the cor- relation between TyG and its combination with obesity index change trajectories and the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in T2DM patients is still limited.

**Materials and methods:**
663 patients with T2DM were selected from Metabolic Management Center of our Hospital. Latent class growth model (LCGM) was used to explore the trajectory patterns of TyG index and its derivative index combined with obesity index: body mass index‌ (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Multivariate COX propor- tional hazard regression was used to analyze the correlation between the trajectory of each index and ASCVD. The predictive efficacy of each index trajectory was compared by receiver operating char- acteristic (ROC) curve analysis to determine the optimal ASCVD predictor.

**Results:**
According to whether ASCVD occurred during the follow- up, patients were divided into ASCVD group and non-ASCVD group. Compared with the non-ASCVD groups, the level of TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR, and TyG-WHR were higher in ASCVD groups ( < 0.05). The patients were divided into three groups according to LCGM, compared with the TyG low-level stable group, the risk of ASCVD in the TyG medium-level stable group and the high-level fluctuation group increased by 1.664 and 4.437 times, respectively ( < 0.05 ). Compared with the TyG-WHR low-level fluctuation group, the risk of ASCVD in the TyG-WHR medium-level fluctua- tion group and the high-level fluctuation group increased by 4.839 and 2.914 times, respectively ( < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the risk of ASCVD among the three groups of TyG- BMI, TyG-WC and TyG-WHtR ( > 0.05 ).TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG- WC, TyG-WHtR, TyG-WHR trajectory variables were included to construct a multivariate COX proportional hazards regression model. After adjusting for confounding factors, the results showed that the area under curve (AUC) of TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR and TyG-WHR index trajectories were 0.84, 0.84, 0.83, 0.83 and 0.84, respectively, and the best cut-off values were 0.66, 0.67, 0.66, 0.28 and 0.17, respectively. By comprehensively comparing the trajecto- ries of each index, the TyG index trajectory shows better ASCVD prediction value.

**Conclusion:**
The TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR and TyG- WHR index trajectories of T2DM patients were all related to the occur- rence of ASCVD, among which TyG and TyG-WHR index trajectories were independent risk factors for ASCVD. The TyG index trajectory of T2DM patients has a high value in predicting the occurrence of ASCVD, and is expected to become a new simple index to predict the ASCVD.

**Effects of semaglutide and empagliflozin on markers of endothelial function in persons with type 2 diabetes: a post-hoc analysis of a randomised trial**

S. Gullaksen, Laugesen

**Background and aims:**
Individuals with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, partly due to increased atherosclerosis. The vascular wall endothelium is vital for maintaining an atheroprotec- tive environment. Endothelial damage can cause leukocyte adhesion, inflammation and dysfunction through upregulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) like E-Selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and P-Selectin. CAMs are upregulated in type 2 diabetes and linked to micro- and macrovascular complications. Impaired endothelial function can also reduce blood flow autoregulation Semaglutide and empagliflozin reduce complication risk, but their effects on CAMs and vascular autoregulation are unclear. We hypothesized that semaglutide, empa- gliflozin, or their combination reduce CAM levels and enhance vascular reactivity.

**Materials and methods:**
This study was a post-hoc analysis of a 32-week randomized trial that examined the individual and combined effects of semaglutide and empagliflozin. A total of 120 participants with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to 1) semaglutide, 2) empagliflozin, 3) combination, or placebo. Biochemical markers were analysed using a Luminex performance assay. Endothelial vasodila- tor function was assessed as the reactive hyperaemic index (LnRHI). Increase in LnRHI is considered beneficial.

**Results:**
Compared to placebo, E-Selectin decreased significantly in the semaglutide arm after 32 weeks (-9.6, 95%CI(-14.1;-5.1)ng/mL, p<0.001). The same was true for the combination group (-9.8, 95%CI (-14.3;-5.3)ng/mL, p <0.001). In the empagliflozin group, there was no significant decrease after 32 weeks (figure 1). Adjustment for glycae- mia and BMI did not change the estimates significantly. ICAM-1 levels tended to decrease in the semaglutide group compared to placebo, but the change was not statistically significant (-4%, p = 0.11). In contrast, compared to placebo VCAM-1 increased after 32 weeks, in both the semaglutide and combination group (14 %, 95%CI (3;26)%, p=0.01 and 19%, 95%CI(8;32)%, p=0.001, respectively).There was no change in P-Selectin in any of the groups. Adjustment for HbA1c and BMI did not change the estimates significantly. Compared to baseline, LnRHI increased significantly in the semaglutide group in the adjusted model (adjusted for heart rate, calcium channel blockers, statins, and aspi- rin) (11 %, 95%CI (1;21)%, p=0.03). Compared to placebo, there was no difference (10%, 95%CI(-4;24)%, p=0.16) (figure 1). We observed no change in neither the empagliflozin nor the combination group (p>0.69).

**Conclusion:**
In summary, semaglutide decreased E-selectin indepen- dently of the effect on glycemia and BMI, which is generally consid- ered beneficial in reducing inflammation. In contrast, our data suggests an increase in VCAM. Endothelial function was not affected. The exact relationship between these changes and cardiovascular outcomes would require further investigation.

10. University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany, CeMM Research Center

**Background and aims:**
Adipose tissue homeostasis depends on a healthy vascular network, whereas vascular malfunction is a hallmark of metabolic disease. Although single-cell transcriptomics approaches have defined atlases of human white adipose tissue, the associated vas- cular niche remains relatively undefined, specifically pertaining to its heterogeneity, functions, and roles in metabolic disease.

**Materials and methods:**
We comprehensively mapped the vascu- lar niche of human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) using single nucleus RNA sequencing and validated our key findings using spatial transcriptomics, whole mount immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, two- and three-dimensional cell and organoid culture, lineage tracing, and endothelial cell specific gene knockout murine models of diet- induced obesity.

**Results:**
We constructed an atlas of the human SAT vascular niche at the single cell resolution, which comprised nearly 70,000 vascular cells from 65 individuals. We identified and validated vascular alterations in obesity and type two diabetes and inferred targetable genomic targets modulating the vascular niche. We identified a previously unrecognized endothelial cell population that arises through endothelial-to-mesen- chymal transition, the modulation of which limits obesity associated adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis.

**Conclusion:**
The human SAT vascular niche is heavily remodeled in obesity and type two diabetes, supporting tissue inflammation and fibrosis. The atlas and accompanying analyses establish a solid founda- tion for investigations into the biology of the adipose tissue vascular niche and its contribution to the pathogenesis of metabolic disease.

**Heterogeneity of human endothelial cells from subcutaneous adi- pose and skeletal muscle tissue in type 2 diabetes**

A.-F. Bruns, Brown, K.I. Bridge, K.K. Witte, M.T. Kearney

**Background and aims:**
Heterogeneity of endothelial cells (EC) from different vascular beds and in disease states is increasingly appreci- ated. In diabetic mice, efforts have been made to describe differences in EC from metabolic tissues. Here, we aim to investigate potential heterogeneity of human EC from subcutaneous adipose (ATEC) and skeletal muscle tissue (SkMEC) in the setting of type 2 diabetes mel- litus (T2DM).

**Materials and methods:**
Pectoralis major and adipose tissue biopsies were collected from non-diabetic (ND) and T2DM patients undergo- ing routine cardiac implantable electronic device implantation in line with local ethical approval. All participants provided written informed consent. Procedures were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. For this study, patients were matched for age, sex, BMI, and severity of heart disease. For gene expression analysis, RNAseq of cultured ATEC and SkMEC was employed. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were verified by qRT-PCR. Cellular signalling under basal conditions or after insulin stimulation with a physiologically rel- evant dose of 10 nM was assayed using immunoblotting. Presence of ER-stress, inflammation, and cellular senescence markers was tested by immunoblotting. Positively identified proteins were correlated to clinically relevant patient characteristics.

**Results:**
Our pilot data showed 52 DEG in ATEC (n=25 ND /17 T2DM), but only three DEG in SkMEC (n=16/6). In T2DM ATEC, basal phosphorylation of IGF-1R was increased 2-fold (p=0.0127, n=14/12). However, it remained unchanged in SkMEC (n=7/7, p>0.05). After insulin-stimulation, phosphorylation of IGF-1R in ATEC (n=7/10) was increased 40-fold in ND (p<0.0001) in compari- son to a 10-fold increase in T2DM (p=0.0589). Furthermore, we could only observe an increase in phospho eNOS (S1177) levels (1.5-fold, p=0.002) in ND ATEC (n=7/10) following insulin-stimulation. In com- parison, phospho IGF-1R levels in SkMEC (n=6/4) were increased 15-fold in ND (p=0.1385) after insulin-stimulation but 35-fold in T2DM (p=0.0086). S1177 eNOS phosphorylation in both ND and T2DM SkMEC was minimal (n=6/4, p>0.05) after insulin-stimulation. The ER-stress markers spliced XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) and CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) were elevated by 30% in T2DM ATEC (n=14/12, both p<0.05). In contrast, we could not detect an upregulation of these markers in T2DM SkMEC (n=8/3). Probing for markers of inflammation in ATEC revealed a 2.5-fold increase in IL-8 (n=14/13, p=0.032), which was absent in SkMEC (n=8/3). Expression levels of CHOP (n=25, r=0.5527, p=0.0042) and phospho IGF-1R (n=25, r= 0.5314, p= 0.0063) were positively correlated with HbA1c- levels in ATEC, but not in SkMEC.

**Conclusion:**
Gene expression analysis of ATEC and SkMEC from ND and T2DM patients revealed significant phenotypic heterogeneity. Under basal conditions, T2DM ATEC, but not SkMEC, showed ele- vated IGF-1R phosphorylation. T2DM SkMEC were insulin-sensitive, whereas T2DM ATEC showed evidence of insulin-resistance. T2DM ATEC displayed increased expression of the chemokine IL-8 but not SkMEC. Additionally, our data provide evidence of ER-stress in ATEC from patients with T2DM which correlated with HbA1c. Future work will explore mechanisms underpinning differences in EC from subcu- taneous adipose and skeletal muscle.

**Background and aims:**
Our recent studies demonstrated that red blood cells (RBCs) from type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients induce endothelial dysfunction due to reduced RBC micro (mi)RNA-210 levels. In con- trast, RBCs from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), who do not exhibit overt endothelial dysfunction , did not cause endothelial impairment, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. We hypoth- esize that miR-210 plays a protective role, explaining this difference.

**Materials and methods:**
Eighteen T1D and twenty T2D individuals matched for glycated hemoglobin levels (mmol/mol: 64.0±6.3 in T1D and 65.7±6.0 in T2D) and twenty-one age and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. miR-210 expression was measured in RBCs by qPCR. Endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) was evaluated in aortas isolated from male Wistar rats using wire myograph after 18h incubation with RBCs (hematocrit: 45%). RBCs were transfected with a miR-210 inhibitor or scramble to study miR-210’s function. The vascular involvement of miR-210 target protein tyrosine phos- phatase 1B (PTP1B) and mitochondrial oxidative stress was studied by incubating aortas with a PTP1B inhibitor (10μM) and mitoTEMPO (100μM). Protein expression of PTP1B and oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) was measured in aortas segments follow- ing RBC incubation by immunohistochemistry. Differences in EDR were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with mixed-mode and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Multiple comparisons of miR-210 expres- sion in RBCs from patients with T1D, T2D and healthy controls were performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Differences of protein expression in immunohisto- chemistry and miR-210 expression in RBCs from patients with T1D following transfection were analyzed by ratio paired test after normal- ity and lognormality tests.

**Results:**
EDR was comparable between aortas incubated with RBCs from T1D (Emax=76.8%) and healthy controls (Emax=82.9%), but was significantly impaired in aortas following incubation with RBCs from T2D (Emax=53.5%). This aligns with similar RBC miR-210 lev- els in T1D and healthy controls, whereas T2D RBCs showed reduced expression. miR-210 inhibition in RBCs from T1D patients signifi- cantly downregulated miR-210 expression and led to impaired EDR (Emax=34.8%) compared to the scramble control (Emax=71.4%). The downstream targets PTP1B and 4-HNE protein levels were upregulated in aortas following incubation with T1D RBCs transfected with the miR-210 inhibitor (~2.4 fold, <0.05 of PTP1B and ~3.2 fold, <0.05 of 4-HNE vs. T1D RBC scramble). Notably, the PTP1B inhibition and mitoTEMPO treatment in aortas significantly attenuated impairment of EDR (Emax=81.9% and 84.1%, respectively) induced by T1D RBCs transfected with the miR-210 inhibitor.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the distinct roles of RBCs in T1D and T2D. RBC miR-210 appears to preserve endothelial function in T1D by suppressing vascular PTP1B and oxidative stress. Understand- ing this protective mechanism may pave the way for therapeutic strate- gies at restoring endothelial function in T2D.

**Therapeutic role of genetically modified BM-MSC derived exosomes in rescuing endothelial cells damaged in hyperglycaemia**

S. Sen, S. ­Nandula

2. University, Washington, DC, DC, USA, George Washington Univer-

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes is associated with endothelial dys- function and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Studies have demonstrated that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and mature endothelial cells (EC) both are susceptible to apoptosis in hypergly- cemia (HG) with increased ROS. p53 gene silencing (p53sh) prevents cellular senescence and helps vascular regeneration in HG. Previously we have shown that apoptosis resistant, p53 silenced EPC and even associated conditioned media (CM) helped EC regeneration in HG. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is also a major prob- lem in HG we decided to test and compare whether CM obtained from p53 silenced and SOD2 antioxidant overexpressed human bone mar- row derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) can improve EC function in HG.

**Materials and methods:**
Ad-human-P53 (TP53)-shRNA is used to silence P53 and Ad-humanSOD2 was used to over-express SOD2 in a human stem cell such as BM-BMSC. We choose BM-MSC for these series of experiments as BM-MSCs are of similar lineage as EPCs for much more readily available. Ad-scrambled-null-shRNA was used as control in BM-MSCs. To collect CM, BM-MSCs were cultured in exosome free media for 5days, following transduction with Ad-p53sh and Ad-SOD2 separately and with Ad-null constructs (as control), as the case may be. The collected supernatant was concentrated 10-fold to obtain the conditioned media (CM) before being added to HG exposed human endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC was exposed for 2-3 weeks in 25mmol glucose with media change every 3 days. Endothelial regeneration in HG was tested using endothelial wound healing assay kit ( from Cell Biolabs # CBA-120-T).

**Results:**
We compared CM obtained from null and p53sh- BM-MSC and SOD2- BM-MSCs on human endothelial cells in HG conditions. Number of cells in the scratch area increased significantly in the p53sh- CM compared to scrambled and non-transduced CM. Similar improve- ment was noted with SOD2 upregulated BM-MSC-CM too but to a lesser degree. We are currently comparing the two possible therapeutic potentials in diabetes wound care model, in-vitro and in-vivo models with mass-spectrometry analysis of the two CMs.

**Conclusion:**
P53 silencing and SOD2 over-expression in BM-MSC and the resultant secretome helped rescue pro-apoptotic human endothelial cells exposed to hyperglycemia. These secretomes are expected to have therapeutic role in treating Endothelial dysfunction related complica- tions in diabetes, such as poorly healing wound care.

**Background and aims:**
Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is an early indicator of diabetes-related vascular complications. ECs exhibit organ- specific heterogeneity owing to their distinct metabolic characteristics and functions. However, a comprehensive understanding of how EC heterogeneity and functions are affected by diabetes, especially in large animal models that better mimic human (patho)physiology at multi- organ levels, is still lacking. We use single-nuclei RNA sequencing to study the endothelium in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle from a Mutant Induced Diabetes of Youth (MIDY) pig model to provide a sys- tem-level understanding of diabetes-induced vascular complications.

**Materials and methods:**
Single-nuclei RNA sequencing analysis was performed on nuclei isolated from the liver, kidney (cortex and medulla, separately), and skeletal muscle tissue of three female MIDY pigs and their healthy controls available through the Munich MIDY pig biobank. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted, fol- lowed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis to identify deregulated pathways in the MIDY pigs. Intercellular communication dynamics was also explored using CellChat, a cell-cell interaction prediction technique.

**Results:**
We generated high quality single-cell transcriptome for 62,554 cells from MIDY and control pigs, of which 6915 were ECs. Single- cell transciptome comparison of ECs between MIDY and control pigs showed that the monogenic (C94Y) mutation in the INS gene caused deregulation (adjusted p-value < 0.05) of the ECs in the medulla (364 DEGs, differentially expressed genes), cortex (44 DEGs), and liver (78 DEGs) in the MIDY pigs. GO and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis revealed substantial metabolic reprogramming in the ECs across these organs. In the cortex, dysregulated genes were majorly associated with lipid and glucose metabolism, whereas in the liver, they were enriched for amino acid metabolism. Medullary ECs showed upregulation of GO terms involved in ossification, apoptosis, and tissue remodeling. These ECs also underwent downregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, indicating vascular calcification and endothelial dysfunction. Cell-cell interaction analysis of ECs with other cells in the medulla showed an increase in the SPP1 (Osteopontin) signaling pathway, a marker of calcification pathology, in the MIDY pigs com- pared to their healthy control.

**Conclusion:**
Multi-organ analysis of ECs during permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus revealed distinct metabolic dysregulation pathways associated with endothelial dysfunction. Notably, vascular calcifica- tion was observed in the medullary ECs in the kidney, along with their functional impairment. Further experiments are to be conducted to unravel the underlying molecular mechanism driving this.

**Blocking EndMT in diabetes: insights from diabetic patient serum and AP-1 inhibition**

A. Waheed-Khan, Jandeleit-Dahm

1. Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, German Diabetes Centre,

**Background and aims:**
Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) refers to the process where endothelial cells transform into a mesenchymal-like state, regulated by various factors, including transcription factors like activator protein 1 (AP-1). Using human serum in research offers a realistic model that closely mimics the environment, making it a valuable tool for studying disease mechanisms. Although recent studies have confirmed EndMT’s role in atherosclerosis, the involvement of AP-1 in EndMT, particularly in the context of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis using diabetic patient serum, remains unclear.This study aimed to elucidate the role of the AP-1 transcription factor complex in EndMT associated with atherosclerosis in diabetes, using human serum emphasizing trans- lational relevance. Additionally, it sought to profile gene expression changes following AP-1 inhibition in a diabetes-induced EndMT model.

**Materials and methods:**
Serum from diabetic and non-diabetic patients was used to induce EndMT in primary human aortic endothe- lial cells (HAECs), with and without the AP-1 inhibitor T-5224. EndMT was evaluated through immunofluorescent staining. In addi- tion, HAECs were used to investigate the effects of AP-1 inhibition on the transcriptional signature of EndMT. This was done using an in vitro model of EndMT under high glucose conditions, shRNA-mediated gene knockdown strategies, and RNA sequencing. EndMT was also assessed through immunofluorescent staining of aortic sections in a preclinical early intervention study using a murine model of diabetes- associated atherosclerosis.

**Results:**
Patient-derived serum induced EndMT in HAECs, while T-5224 effectively prevented it, as demonstrated by immunofluo- rescent staining for EndMT marker fibroblast activation protein (FAP). In the HAECs-based EndMT model, T-5224 miti- gated TNFα and high glucose-induced EndMT. RNA sequencing identified 242 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with EndMT under high glucose conditions. Notably, the expression of 77 of these DEGs was restored by T-5224 treatment. Immuno- fluorescent analysis of the aortic sinus for Fap revealed that T-5224 treatment inhibited EndMT, resulting in reduced atherosclerosis in mice.

**Conclusion:**
This study identifies AP-1 inhibition with T-5224 as a potential therapeutic approach for EndMT and related atherosclerosis in diabetes. The use of human serum underscores the physiological and translational relevance of these findings.

**METTL3/YTHDC1 axis-mediated m6a modification of foxo1 mRNA promote endothelial autophagic apoptosis in diabetic atherosclerosis**

X. Wu

**Background and aims:**
Endothelial dysfunction is critical in the gen- esis of diabetic angiopathy. Our previous study revealed that FoxO1 mediates advanced glycation end products (AGEs)-induced human aor- tic endothelial cells (HAECs) autophagic apoptosis through impairing autophagosome-lysosomes fusion in diabetes. However, how AGEs regulate FoxO1 expression needs further investigation. m6A modifica- tion plays an important role in various biological processes, whether it is involved in AGEs-induced autophagic apoptosis in HAECs has not been reported. Therefore, we aimed to explore the change of m6A mod- ifications in diabetic vascular plaques and AGEs-treated HAECs, and investigate the role of METTL3 in AGEs-induced autophagic apoptosis in HAECs by promoting FOXO1 expression in diabetic atherosclerosis.

**Materials and methods:**
RNA-m6A methylation and regulatory fac- tors METTL3/YTHDC1 expression in carotid plaques of diabetic patients and aortic plaques of diabetic ­ApoE mice induced by STZ were detected by quantitative kit, immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence co-localisation respectively. MeRIP-seq was used to detect m6A modification profiles in AGEs-treated HAECs. RNA- protein interactions were detected by RNA-binding protein immuno- precipitation. The expression of target mRNA and protein was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. siRNA was used to inhibit the expression of METTL3 and YTHDC1. The apoptosis level was detected by flow cytometry. Tamoxifen-inducible endothelial- specific Mettl3-deficient model mice were generated and mated with ­ApoE mice, to observe the change of aortic plaques under diabetic condition.

**Results:**
Increased RNA-m6A modification had been found in both human diabetic carotid plaques, aortic plaques of diabetic atheroscle- rotic mice and AGEs-treated HAECs, especially in FoxO1 mRNA, with notably increased expression of METTL3 and YTHDC1. Inhi- bition of METTL3 expression significantly reversed AGEs-induced elevated m6A levels of mRNA, elevated FoxO1 expression and autophagic apoptosis. AGEs promoted significantly higher bind- ing of YTHDC1 to the m6A site within the 3 -UTR-3 of FoxO1 mRNA. Silencing YTHDC1 significantly reduced AGEs-induced up-regulation of FoxO1 expression. In diabetic atherosclerotic mice, endothelial-spe- cific METTL3 knockout mice displayed less aortic plaque formation compared with controls.

**Conclusion:**
METTL3/YTHDC1 axis-mediated m6A modification of FoxO1 mRNA promote endothelial autophagic apoptosis in diabetic atherosclerosis, which might be novel target for intervention.

**Low-grade inflammation does not mediate the associations between the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and CVD in participants with and without type 2 diabetes: The Maastricht Study**

3. Institute for Health Research, Madrid, Spain, Pharmacology Unit,

5. UK, Epidemiology department, CAPHRI Care and Public Health

**Background and aims:**
Growing evidence links n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFAs) to a lower CVD risk, potentially via reduced low- grade inflammation (LGI). We examined whether LGI mediates the association between n-3 PUFA concentrations and cardiovascular dis- eases (CVD), and if this is modified by type 2 diabetes (T2D).

**Materials and methods:**
Cross-sectional data from The Maastricht Study (n=3158, 50.9% men, 60±8y, 26.6% T2D) were analyzed. Total n-3 PUFAs and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were measured in fasted EDTA plasma with H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). LGI was defined as the average z-score of the plasma inflammation biomarkers CRP, SAA, IL-6, IL-8, sICAM-1 and TNF-α. CVD was self-reported as a history of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or periph- eral artery disease. Mediation analyses were performed with the n-3 PUFAs (z-standardized) as main exposures, LGI as potential media- tor and CVD as binary outcome. Analyses were adjusted for relevant confounders, including BMI, physical activity and serum triglycerides. Analyses were also stratified by T2D. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.

**Results:**
A total of 517 participants had a history of CVD. The overall associations of the n-3 PUFAs with CVD were inverse and statisti- cally significant (Total n-3 PUFAs: OR=0.68, DHA: OR=0.58). The n-3 PUFAs were inversely associated with LGI (Total n-3 PUFAs: β=-0.08, DHA: β=-0.04; p<0.05), while the associations between LGI and CVD (adjusted for the corresponding n-3 PUFA) were positive (Total n-3 PUFAs: OR=1.15, DHA: OR=1.16; p<0.05). Consequently, mediation by LGI, while statistically significant, was modest-to-absent (<5%). The n-3 PUFAs were inversely associated with CVD in partici- pants with and without T2D, but DHA was more strongly associated with CVD in those without T2D (non-T2D: OR=0.47, T2D: OR=0.77; p<0.01). The associations of the n-3 PUFAs with LGI in participants without T2D were inverse (Total n-3 PUFAs: β=-0.11, DHA: β=-0.06; p=<0.01). In participants with T2D, these associations were weaker and non-significant (NS). Positive associations between LGI and CVD (adjusted for the corresponding n-3 PUFA), on the other hand, were stronger in those with T2D (Total n-3 PUFAs: OR=1.21, DHA: OR=1.23: p<0.05), while they were positive but NS in the non-T2D group (OR=1.08 for both). No significant mediation effects by LGI were observed in either group.

**Conclusion:**
In this population-based cohort, plasma-based LGI did not explain a substantial part of the inverse associations between the n-3 PUFAs and CVD in participants with or without T2D. However, the associations of the n-3 PUFAs with CVD were weaker in those with T2D, suggesting that the underlying pathway may be altered in T2D. Further research is needed to explain the effect of the n-3 PUFAs on CVD, and the roles of LGI and T2D therein.

**Effect of colchicine on vascular inflammation in patients with type**

**Background and aims:**
The anti-inflammatory drug colchicine has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with and without diabetes. However, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects remain unclear. Chronic low-grade inflammation, a hallmark feature of type 2 diabetes, contributes to the development of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. This study investigated the effect of colchicine on vascular inflammation using ­[ F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ­([ F]FDG-PET/ CT).

**Materials and methods:**
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial, we included 30 individuals with type 2 diabetes and either established cardiovascular disease or a high cardiovascular risk. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive colchicine (0.5 mg/day) or placebo for 26 weeks. Vascular inflammation in the aortic wall was assessed with dynamic ­[ F]FDG-PET/CT, measuring standardized uptake values ­(SUV ), metabolic rate of glucose uptake ­(MR ), and target-to-background ratio (TBR). To estimate the reliability of these PET-derived markers, test-retest repeatability was evaluated in a subgroup of 15 participants using Bland-Altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).

**Results:**
Colchicine treatment did not lead to significant changes in vascular inflammation compared to placebo after 26 weeks. Changes in ­SUV (ΔSUV : -1.0% (95% CI: -7.1;5.1, = 0.75)) (Figure), ­MR (ΔMR : -0.5% (95% CI: -19.7;18.7, = 0.96)), or TBR (ΔTBR: 0.01 (95% CI: -0.17;0.20, = 0.88)) were not statistically significant. The test-retest analysis revealed acceptable repeatability with ICCs of 0.69 for ­SUV and 0.66 for ­MR , and corresponding within-subject coefficients of variation of 3.5% and 6.4%, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
In patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascu- lar risk, low-dose colchicine did not reduce vascular inflammation as assessed by dynamic ­[ F]FDG-PET/CT. These findings suggest that the cardioprotective benefits of colchicine may be mediated through mechanisms other than a direct reduction in vascular inflammation, particularly in populations with a low inflammatory burden.

**Background and aims:**
Atherosclerotic progression differs between patients with and without T2D, even with similar risk factors. Chronic inflammation due to hyperglycemia is a key driver of atherosclero- sis, potentially linking it to diabetes. Recent findings suggest immune cell dysfunction plays a crucial role in disease progression. This study evaluates hyperglycemia’s impact on gene expression and immune infil- tration in atheromatous plaques, identifying molecular mechanisms underlying increased cardiovascular risk in T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Carotid plaques (n=117) were collected from patients undergoing stroke-preventive carotid endarterectomy and cate- gorized by glucose metabolism: normal (NGM, n=24), impaired (IGM; IGT, IFG per ADA criteria, n=28), with newly diagnosed (nT2D, n=18) or pre-existing type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=47). Baseline charac- teristics were analyzed via Fisher’s exact test or ANOVA. Plaques were histologically classified (AHA criteria). RNA sequencing (Illumina NexSeq500, 30M paired-end reads/sample) was performed. Differential expression and functional enrichment analyses were conducted using edgeR and ClusterProfiler.

**Results:**
Compared to NGM, IGM, nT2D, and T2D patients exhib- ited overall similar metabolic alterations, with significantly higher glycemic (FPG: 94.0±12.9, 91.7±9.2, 98.7±12.3, 135.8±42.56 mg/dl, padj.=2.7E-10; AUC OGTT Glucose: 15877.5±1956.3, 19116.4±1923.3, 23925.0±3608.8 mg/dl*min, padj.=1.3E-11; HbA1c 38.1±4.0, 37.7±3.7, 40.9±7.9, 53.3±11.90 mmol/mol, padj. = 4.1E- 12; HOMA IR: 2.7 ±1.7, 2.5±1.4, 5.8±11.7, 7.1±6.34, padj.=0.03) and blood pressure (SBP: 134.3±20.9, 131.9±18.4, 140.8±19.0, 144.8±17.01 mm/Hg, padj.=0.05) or lower HDL (44.3±9.8, 49.8±16.0, 49.2±15.3, 41.3±12.17 mg/dl, padj.=0.04) values. We identified 750, 520, and 432 DE genes (adj.p<0.05) in IGM, nT2D, and T2D plaques vs. NGM, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis showed a progressive decline in cell metabolic, growth, and differentia- tion processes (IGM, nT2D, T2D vs. NGM) alongside steady cytokine- mediated immune response activation (GO:0071345; GO:0002376; GO:0006955; GO:0034097; GO:0019221) and phagocytosis sup- pression in IGM and nT2D (GO:0006911). Apoptosis increased in nT2D (GO:0010942), while angiogenesis was upregulated in T2D (GO:0001568; GO:0001944) plaques.

**Conclusion:**
Hyperglycemia-induced low-grade inflammation alters the plaque microenvironment, promoting phenomena such as defective phagocytosis and neovascularization thus increasing cardiovascular risk. Future efforts will assess immune cell infiltration via RNA-seq deconvolution (CIBERSORT) and immunofluorescence to uncover molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular burden in T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes, a worldwide and rapidly grow- ing health concern, is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular complications including Type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a distinct form of cardiomyopathy that directly affects the myocardium. Significant macrophage infiltration into the diabetic myocardium, with oxidative stress and inflammation are widely recognized as key drivers of diabetic cardiac dysfunction. The increasing prevalence, poor prog- nosis, and lack of effective treatments necessitate the development of targeted therapeutics to address this significant health issue. Itaconate, a metabolite derived from the TCA cycle, is highly upregulated during pro-inflammatory macrophage activation and exhibits anti-inflamma- tory and antioxidative properties via various mechanisms, including inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase, induction of the main regulator of oxidant stress namely the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and inhibition of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is a major driver of inflammation in DCM. In this study, Itaconate was used in activated macrophages to investigate its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, with the aim of extending these findings to models of DCM to show that itaconate lessens cardiac dysfunction.

**Materials and methods:**
Primary wildtype murine bone marrow- derived macrophages were pre-treated with 4-octyl Itaconate (4OI, a cell-permeable derivate) (25-100μM) before priming with Lipopolysac- charide (0.1 μg/mL) and activating with ATP (1 mmol/L) or Palmitate (200μM) or Glucose (25mM) to mimic an inflammatory condition, the metabolic syndrome, or diabetic condition respectively. Protein secre- tion was determined by ELISA and Western Blot, and gene expression changes were assessed by qRT-PCR. All statistical analyses were per- formed using GraphPad Prism, with p<0.05 considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
Both IL-1β gene expression and secreted IL-1β protein levels were significantly attenuated by 4OI both under inflammatory condi- tions and in the presence of palmitate or glucose (p<0.01). Further- more, gene expression of inflammatory MCP-1, IL-6, and ICAM-1 were also significantly attenuated by 4OI (p<0.0001). 4OI resulted in a significant increase in the expression of the antioxidant gene NQO1 (p<0.0001), an important indicator of transcriptional activation of Nrf2 by 4OI. In addition, Western blot results showed a reduction in NLRP3 protein levels.

**Conclusion:**
These results suggest that 4OI lessens inflammation and bolsters antioxidant responses under inflammatory and diabetic condi- tions, strengthening its therapeutic potential for targeting inflamma- tion and oxidative stress in DCM in order to improve the function of diabetic heart.

**Background and aims:**
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly those with cardiovascular complications, exhibit elevated levels of biomarkers such as IL-6, NT-proBNP, and TNF-α. This study evaluates the prognostic significance of these biomarkers for all-cause mortality and their correlation with platelet functionality in T2DM patients.

**Materials and methods:**
We monitored a cohort of 303 T2DM patients for a median of 5.9 years, during which 34 patients (11.2%) died. We quantitatively assessed serum levels of IL-6, NT-proBNP, and TNF-α, and measured platelet reactivity using the VerifyNow system, with hyperreactivity defined by a threshold value of 515.

**Results:**
ROC analysis indicated that IL-6 (AUC: 0.653, p=0.004), NT-proBNP (AUC: 0.688, p<0.001), and TNF-α (AUC: 0.657, p=0.003) are significant predictors of mortality. The predictive accu- racy improved when these biomarkers were combined (AUC: 0.697, p=0.0002). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the combined bio- marker panel proved to be a robust predictor of mortality (HR=4.10, 95% CI: 1.9-8.8; p=0.0003). Additionally, patients with hyperreactive platelets had significantly higher levels of TNF-α than those with nor- mal reactivity (p=0.019). SHAP analysis identified IL-6 as the most crucial predictor of mortality. Bioinformatic analysis revealed 34 com- mon molecular targets among the biomarkers, implicating them in key pathways such as cytokine signaling, vitamin B12 metabolism, and dilated cardiomyopathy.

**Conclusion:**
This study underscores the link between elevated TNF-α levels and platelet hyperreactivity, highlighting the complex interplay between inflammatory cytokines and platelet-endothelial interactions. SHAP analysis reaffirms the critical role of IL-6 in mortality predic- tion. Furthermore, our bioinformatic findings illuminate the pathways through which these biomarkers influence the pathophysiology of cardiovascular conditions and contribute to inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular diseases in T2DM patients.

**Background and aims:**
The role of intestinal inflammation and perme- ability in low-grade systemic inflammation in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is under investigation. Our study explores interconnections between gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms with histopathological and immunohis- tochemical analysis of colon biopsies, and variables associated with gut inflammation and systemic endotoxemia in subjects with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Twenty T1D and seven healthy controls were selected for colonoscopy. A validated questionnaire evaluated GI symptoms. The levels of LPS-binding protein (LBP), and endog- enous anti-endotoxin core antibodies (EndoCAb IgG and IgM) were measured in serum. In feces, the levels of calprotectin, IgA, albumin, protein, and intestinal alkaline phosphatase activities were analyzed. Colon biopsy materials were analysed immunochemically for leukocyte markers cluster of differentiation (CD) antigens CD3+, CD20+, CD4+, CD8+, CD138+ and CD68+ expression.

**Results:**
Expression of CD antigens in lamina propria did not dif- fer significantly between T1D and control subjects. In TD1 group, expression of CD3+ correlated positively with CD20+ (r = 0.47; = 0.037), CD4+ (r = 0.58; = 0.008) and CD8+ (r = 0.55; = 0.012) and CD138+ correlated positivity with CD4+ (r = 0.45; = 0.044). In addition, expression of CD20+, CD3+ and CD4+ correlated positively with systolic blood pressure (r=0.47, =0.037; r=0.54, =0.005; r=0.54, =0.014 respectively) and CD3+ and CD4+ correlated posi- tively with serum triglycerides (r=0.58, =0.008 and r=0.43, =0.06 respectively), indicating a link between gut inflammation and car- diovascular risk factors. Expression of CD20+, CD8+, CD138+ and CD68+ correlated significantly with several GI symptoms and usage of medications for diarrhoea. The expression of CD20+ B lympho- cytes correlated positively with calprotectin (r = 0.56; = 0.038). Negative correlation was found between CD20+ and faecal IgA (r = -0.63; = 0.017), and IgA (r = -0.67; = 0.008). CD68+ correlated positively with fecal albumin (r = 0.65; = 0.013), indicating a link between macrophage/histiocyte expression and intestinal permeability. EndoCAb IgM in serum correlated negatively with the expression of CD138+ and CD4+ demonstrating links between T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte activation in gut mucosa and systemic response to endotoxin. Similarly, CD4+ in the lamina propria was negatively cor- related with serum LBP, indicating gut mucosa T-helper involvement in opposing endotoxaemia. On the contrary, EndoCab IgM correlated positively with the expression of CD68+in the lamina propria, a mac- rophage/histiocyte marker.

**Conclusion:**
Intestinal immune system activation seems to play a sig- nificant role in systemic inflammatory response in T1D. A key point for future studies is to identify the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

**Background and aims:**
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a com- mon virus that can cause severe respiratory disease in older adults and those with comorbidities such as metabolic, cardiovascular and renal diseases. In a randomised, placebo-controlled, multicountry, phase 3 trial involving participants aged ≥60 years, AS01E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein vaccine (adjuvanted RSVPreF3), approved by lead- ing health authorities, demonstrated a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 62.9% against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-LRTD) and 51.1% against RSV-related acute respiratory illness (RSV-ARI) across 3 RSV seasons. This post-hoc analysis evaluated the VE of the adju- vanted RSVPreF3 among participants with diabetes and/or obesity from the same trial.

**Materials and methods:**
Medically stable adults aged ≥60 years were randomised 1:1 to receive a single dose of adjuvanted RSVPreF3 or placebo, before RSV season 1. VE against first occurrence of RSV- LRTD and RSV-ARI was assessed in subgroups of participants with diabetes and/or obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) across 3 RSV seasons.

**Results:**
In total, 24,966 participants were included in the modified exposed set (adjuvanted RSVPreF3: 12,468; placebo: 12,498) and fol- lowed up for a median of 30.6 months across 3 RSV seasons. Of these, 22.9% and 37.8% (adjuvanted RSVPreF3), and 23.2% and 38.0% (pla- cebo) had diabetes and obesity, respectively. Across 3 RSV seasons, VE of a single dose of adjuvanted RSVPreF3 in participants with diabetes was 69.8% (RSV-LRTD) and 61.8% (RSV-ARI). In participants with obesity, VE was 74.1% (RSV-LRTD) and 62.4% (RSV-ARI) (Figure). Overall, the adjuvanted RSVPreF3 showed a clinically acceptable safety profile in adults aged ≥60 years.

**Conclusion:**
Adjuvanted RSVPreF3 is efficacious against RSV-LRTD and RSV-ARI across 3 RSV seasons in adults aged ≥60 years with diabetes and/or obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Saturated fatty acids (e.g. stearic acid, SA) may promote lipotoxicity, a pathogenetic mechanism implicated in car- diometabolic disorders. Within this setting, the equilibrium between M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophage (MΦ) phenotypes is known to exert a pivotal role in disease pathophysiol- ogy. We postulated that the SGLT2-inhibitor empagliflozin (EMPA) may reduce, at least in part, cardiovascular risk by counteracting MΦ lipotoxicity. The aims of this study were to investigate in human M2 MΦ: a) the effects of SA on phenotype and immunometabolism; b) the potential mitigating role of EMPA against SA-induced lipotoxicity.

**Materials and methods:**
Monocyte-derived MΦ from healthy donors were polarized toward an M2-IL4 phenotype and preincubated with/ without EMPA (100 μM) in the presence/absence of SA (200 μM). Polarization markers, oxidative stress, and inflammation were assessed using FACS analysis and qPCR. Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activa- tion was evaluated by western blot and its involvement further explored using a specific inhibitor (SP600125). Steady-state bioenergetic fluxes (pmol/min in 5x10 cells) were measured by indirect cellular micro- calorimetry, integrating quantification of four independent fluxes [O consumption and H production by Seahorse (Agilent), lactate and NH release by microfluorimetry] with stoichiometric equations of major metabolic pathways. The role of glycolysis was investigated by cultur- ing M2 MΦ in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose (5 mM).

**Results:**
Compared to control, exposure to SA reduced the expression of CD209, a canonical marker of the M2 (−7.8±1 fold), while signifi- cantly increasing the expression of CD86, a surface marker associated with M1 (+5.8±0.2 fold; both p<0.001), thereby indicating a shift in polarization status. SA increased oxidative stress markers (p<0.05) and enhanced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, includ- ing TNF-α (+2.9±0.6 fold; p<0.005), IL-8 (+25±4 fold; p<0.001) and IL-6 (+2.2±0.4 fold; p<0.05), via JNK-dependent pathway(s). Moreover, SA induced a pronounced rise in anaerobic glycolysis flux (+56±5 pmol/min) and ATP production (+112±10 pmol/min) compared to control (both p<0.05), consistent with a shift toward a glycolytic, M1-like metabolic phenotype. Targeted inhibition studies confirmed that this glycolytic reprogramming underlies the enhanced JNK-mediated inflammatory response induced by SA. EMPA signifi- cantly attenuated the SA-induced upregulation of IL-8 and IL-6 (both p<0.05), but not oxidative stress. Investigations on the effects of EMPA on cellular metabolic fluxes are currently ongoing.

**Conclusion:**
SA induces a functional and metabolic reprogramming of anti-inflammatory M2 MΦ toward a pro-inflammatory, M1-like immunometabolic phenotype, pointing to a novel pathophysiological connection between lipotoxicity and cardiometabolic risk. EMPA par- tially mitigates these alterations, suggesting a novel mechanism through which this agent may exert its cardioprotective effects.

3. Terrassa, Spain, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

**Background and aims:**
Preeclampsia (PE) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but their combined effect on atherosclerosis progression has not been fully explored. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of T1D and PE on the progression of atherosclerosis.

**Materials and methods:**
This prospective cohort study enrolled 112 women without pre-existing CVD, whose last pregnancy occurred at least five years before. Participants were stratified into four groups: T1D+/PE+ (n=28), T1D+/PE- (n=28), T1D-/PE+ (n=28), and T1D-/ PE- (n=28). Groups were matched by age, several cardiovascular risk factors, and diabetes duration and retinopathy in participants with T1D. All subjects underwent an initial assessment and a follow-up visit five years later, which included anthropometric evaluation, blood tests, and carotid ultrasound. Atherosclerosis progression was defined as an increase in carotid plaque number or the occurrence of a cardiovas- cular event (CVE) during follow-up (fatal or non-fatal ischemic heart disease, fatal or non-fatal stroke, and/or heart failure).

**Results:**
A total of 104 women (92.9%) completed the follow-up (54 with T1D, mean age at inclusion 45.2±7.6 years, mean follow-up 5.3±1.2 years). An increase in carotid plaques was identified in 34 women (32.7%), and 3 CVEs (2.9%) occurred. In women with T1D, a history of PE was associated with a twofold increase in atheroscle- rosis progression (57.7% vs 25.0%, p=0.015). In multivariate models adjusted for age and cardiovascular risk factors, PE [OR 4.97 (1.61- 15.29), p=0.005] and PE+T1D [OR 7.69 (1.25-47.29), p=0.028] were independently associated with atherosclerosis progression (Figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
PE was a strong independent predictor of atherosclerosis progression over a 5-year follow-up period, with an additive effect in T1D. These findings highlight preeclampsia as a significant CVD risk enhancer in young women with T1D.

**Higher daily insulin requirements as an indicator of cardiovascular**

**Background and aims:**
Insulin resistance may contribute to car- diovascular disease in adults with type-1 diabetes. In a large multi- center registry, we investigated whether daily insulin requirement, an indirect measure of insulin resistance, is related to the prevalence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke in adults with type-1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
16,731 patients aged 30 - 80 years were analysed. For each patient, the 3 most recent years of observa- tion were aggregated. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were HbA1c > 7.5 %, blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg, LDL-cholesterol > 130 mg/dl, cigarette smoking, or overweight/obesity (WHO cat- egories). Daily insulin requirement per kg of body weight was cate- gorized into quartiles and adjusted for insulin pump use. Diagnosis of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery disease, or heart failure during the observation period were evaluated using logistic regression adjusting for demographics (age, gender, diabetes dura- tion), traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and the interaction between insulin requirement and insulin pump use.

**Results:**
Patients’ mean age was 52.8 years, mean diabetes dura- tion 21.1 years, 55.3 % were male. Prevalence rates were 5.6 % for myocardial infarction, 11.6% for coronary artery disease, 1.7% for heart failure, and 3.9% for stroke. A significant, positive and continuous relationship to the quartiles of insulin requirement per kg of body weight was present for myocardial infarction (p < 0.05, see figure), for coronary heart disease (p < 0.01).

**Conclusion:**
Insulin resistance, as indicated by higher daily insulin requirements, is associated with cardiovascular disease in adults with type-1 diabetes. Our findings support the inclusion of high insulin requirement to the list of risk factors for macrovas- cular complications in people with type 1 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health is an emerging concept with important clinical implications. We sought to construct an integrated risk score for a composite outcome including cardiovascular, kidney, lower limb outcomes, and all-cause mortality. We then assessed the prognostic performance of this risk score in identifying people with type 1 diabetes at high risk for each individual outcome.

**Materials and methods:**
We used pooled data from the multicen- tre, binational (France and Belgium) GENEDIAB and GENESIS prospective cohorts of participants with type 1 diabetes. Candidate predictors included routine clinical and biological characteristics at baseline. The composite outcome was defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following during follow-up: myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, end-stage renal disease (ESKD), lower limb amputation (LLA), or all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models with forward selection were used to identify independent predictors of the composite outcome. The risk score was derived from the final Cox model and categorised into 3 equal tertiles (T1, T2, T3). Harrell C-statistics were used to assess the prognostic per- formance of the risk score.

**Results:**
Among 1100 participants (female 46%, age 43±12 years, dia- betes duration 27±10 years), the composite outcome occurred in 415 (42%) participants during a median follow-up of 6 years (incidence rate 5.4, 95% CI 4.9, 6.0 per 100 person-years). Independent predic- tors of the composite outcome included older age, male sex, history of cardiovascular disease, history of lower limb amputation, history of peripheral diabetic neuropathy, lower estimated glomerular filtra- tion rate, higher albuminuria, and use of antihypertensive medication. Participants in the highest tertiles had an excess risk of the composite outcome compared with those in the lowest tertile (hazard ratio for T2 vs. T1 2.44 [95% CI 1.75, 3.40] and hazard ratio for T3 vs. T1 6.17 [95% CI 4.54, 8.39]).The c-statistic index of the risk score to identify people at risk for the composite outcome was 0.74 (95% CI 0.71, 0.77). The risk score provided a high c-index for CVD (0.75 [95% CI 0.71, 0.80]), ESKD (0.81 [95% CI 0.76, 0.87]), LLA (0.81 [95% CI 0.76, 0.86]) and all-cause mortality (0.78 [95% CI 0.75, 0.81]).

**Conclusion:**
A number of routinely measured clinical characteristics identify people with type 1 diabetes who are likely to experience a composite of cardiovascular, renal, lower limb outcomes and death during follow-up. The integrated risk score of a composite outcome has high prognostic performance for predicting each individual dia- betes outcome.

**Background and aims:**
Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have a high cardiovascular risk; however, factors associated with the develop- ment of atherosclerosis remain poorly understood. This study aimed to assess changes in cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and their rela- tionship with the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in individu- als with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
This prospective study followed a stand- ardized cardiovascular risk assessment protocol in individuals with T1D without established cardiovascular disease, aged ≥40 years, with diabetic kidney disease and/or ≥10 years of T1D duration plus an additional CVRF. Atherosclerosis was assessed via carotid ultrasound and repeated after 3-5 years. Progression was defined as an increase in the number of plaques. CVRFs were considered optimal if LDL- cholesterol was within the range based on atherosclerotic burden, blood pressure (BP) <130/80 mmHg, HbA1c <7%, and non-smoking status. Cardiovascular risk was estimated using the Steno Type 1 Risk Engine (ST1RE).

**Results:**
A total of 151 individuals with T1D (55.6% women, mean age 48.9±8.9 years, T1D duration 27.3±9.1 years, 42.4% with plaques) were included. Over a mean follow-up of 5.22±1.29 years, despite significant improvement in almost all CVRFs (see table), atherosclerosis progression occurred in 40.4% of participants. Indi- viduals with high cardiovascular risk according to ST1RE improved their CVRF control, particularly LDL-cholesterol, though elevated BP levels persisted. Among active smokers, improvement was observed only in those without pre-existing atherosclerosis. While women had a lower overall cardiovascular risk, they smoked more frequently and showed less improvement in LDL-cholesterol levels compared to men. In logistic regression models considering changes in ST1RE, only baseline ST1RE was independently associated with plaque progres- sion (OR [95% CI]: 1.06 [1.02-1.11]). When considering changes in CVRFs (body mass index, LDL-cholesterol, BP, HbA1c, and smok- ing), baseline ST1RE (OR: 1.06 [1.02-1.11]) and continued smok- ing (OR: 2.52 [1.06-5.99]) remained independently associated with progression.

**Conclusion:**
Despite optimization of CVRF control in a large pro- portion of patients, atherosclerosis progression remains common in individuals with T1D. In this context, the ST1RE may help identify those at higher risk of progression.

**Detection of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in young patients with type 1 diabetes using cardiac MRI**

V. Oksana

**Background and aims:**
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) face significantly elevated risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mor- tality. Subclinical pathological remodeling of the myocardial extracel- lular matrix, characterized by progressive diffuse fibrosis, represents an early manifestation of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diffuse myocardial fibrosis (DMF) ultimately culminates in chronic heart failure and/or life-threatening arrhythmias in young T1DM patients. Aim. To assess the myocardial tissue composition and cardiac function in young T1DM patients without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) using cardiac MRI with T1 mapping and to evaluate the ability of this method to detect fibrotic myocardial changes independent of conven- tional biomarkers.

**Materials and methods:**
A comparative study was conducted in 110 participants without CVD or obesity: 80 T1DM patients (mean age 26 years; 39 males, 41 females; median T1DM duration 6.0 [IQR 3.2-10.1] years) and 30 controls without T1DM (mean age 27 years; 13 males, 17 females). Exclusion criteria were acute T1DM com- plications, glomerular filtration rate <89 mL/min, and significant micro- or macrovascular complications. All participants underwent laboratory testing (complete blood count, biochemical analysis, thy- roid-stimulating hormone, hemoglobin A1c), electrocardiography (ECG), and cardiac MRI with T1 mapping. Quantitative data are presented as median [Me], interquartile range [Q1; Q3], n - sub- group size, r - correlation coefficient, p - statistical significance level (threshold p < 0.05).

**Results:**
The groups were comparable in age, sex, BMI, and physi- cal activity. Cardiac MRI with T1 mapping revealed DMF in 8.7% of T1DM patients, whereas no fibrosis was detected in controls. Focal fibrosis was absent in both groups. T1DM patients with DMF had a longer disease duration (8 vs. 5 years), but HbA1c levels did not differ between T1DM subgroups with and without DMF.

**Conclusion:**
In young T1DM patients without overt CVD, cardiac MRI with T1 mapping can detect pathological DMF, which is not identifiable by routine echocardiography but may contribute to life- threatening arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities. In addition to its arrhythmogenic effects, DMF impairs myocardial contractility, potentially leading to the most common cardiovascular complication in T1DM—chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. These findings highlight the potential of cardiac MRI with T1 mapping to improve early identification of high-risk patients and develop personal- ized treatment strategies.

**Global prevalence of heart failure in 19 million individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis by continent**

H.J. Rennison, Petrie, P.S. Jhund, J.J.V. McMurray, M.M.Y. Lee

**Background and aims:**
The relationship between diabetes and heart failure (HF) is well established, yet a universally accepted estimate of HF prevalence in individuals with diabetes remains elusive. Geo- graphic variations in HF prevalence among individuals with diabetes have not been systematically compared. Understanding these differ- ences could enhance global awareness of the disease burden and inform public health strategies for earlier HF detection and region-specific treatment approaches. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HF in the general population of individuals with diabetes, stratified by continent.

**Materials and methods:**
A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, identifying original studies published between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2023. Eligible studies included large general population cohorts (≥1,000 participants) with diabetes, reporting HF prevalence at baseline. Study screening and data extrac- tion were performed independently by at least two researchers. The pooled HF prevalence was estimated using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation and stratified by continent.

**Results:**
A total of 19,680 titles and abstracts, identified through PubMed and EMBASE, were screened, 1,614 full-texts articles were reviewed, and 86 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 79 stud- ies from four continents (Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania) were included in the meta-analysis. No eligible studies were identified from Africa or South America. The pooled prevalence of HF among individuals with diabetes was: Asia 3.8% (95% CI: 2.4-5.5%), Europe 5.9% (95% CI: 4.7-7.3%), North America 10.0% (95% CI: 8.2-12.0%), and Oceania (one study) 5.6% (95% CI: 4.9-6.3%).

**Conclusion:**
Substantial geographical variation in HF prevalence among individuals with diabetes highlights challenges in establishing a global prevalence estimate. The absence of data from Africa and South America underscores the need for more inclusive research. Differences in prevalence may reflect regional disparities in healthcare access and resources, diagnostic criteria, or population risk factors, warranting further investigation in future studies.

**Recurrent hypoglycaemia in a rodent model of type 1 diabetes promotes cardiac vulnerability and cardiomyopathy after 20 but not 6 weeks**

H.J. Merchant, Kerr, J.G. Gallagher, R.J. McCrimmon, A.D. McNeilly

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the pri- mary cause of mortality in people with type 1 diabetes and has long been attributed to chronic hyperglycaemia. However, recent analyses of multicentre randomised controlled trails have demonstrated that recurrent hypoglycaemia is associated with worse cardiovascular out- comes in both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Here, we sought to investigate the mechanism(s) through which recurrent hypogly- caemia exacerbates the development of CVD.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL6 mice (aged 10 weeks) were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of STZ (150 mg/kg, i.p.) or an equal volume vehicle control (i.p.). Hyperglycaemia was con- firmed by tail-vein blood glucose assessment 72hr and 7 days post- injection (blood glucose levels of ≥16 mmol/L). LinBit insulin s.c. implants were administered to maintain body weight. Mice were further subdivided into recurrent hypoglycaemia (RH) or recur- rent saline (RS) groups. Short-term study animals underwent three weekly insulin injections (target blood glucose < 3 mmol/L, s.c.) per week for 6 weeks, whereas long-term study animals underwent 20 weeks of treatment. Microvascular function was assessed using Laser Doppler Imaging, and cardiac function was evaluated using Pressure-Volume (PV) loops. Bulk RNA-seq was also performed on left ventricular tissue.

**Results:**
After six weeks, compared to Control + RS, STZ-diabetic mice exhibited a significant reduction in acetylcholine response, indica- tive of a reduction in endothelial-dependent vasodilation (p < 0.05). This defect was augmented further following RH (STZ-diabetic + RH, p < 0.01). No differences in resting blood flow or vasoconstriction to phenylephrine were observed. As microvascular dysfunction is an early predictor of CVD, we next chose to assess cardiac function via PV loop after both 6- and 20 weeks of treatment. At 6 weeks, RH on a control background resulted in increased end-systolic volume and pressure (p < 0.01); however, these differences were lost after 20 weeks of RH, suggesting an initial compensation followed by adaptation. Importantly, these adaptations were not observed in STZ-diabetic animals exposed to RH at 6 weeks. Conversely, on a background of hyperglycaemia, RH resulted in significantly impaired load-independent contractility (preload adjusted maximum change of pressure over time (dP/dT / EDV)) compared to Control + RS (p < 0.05) and Control + RH (p < 0.01) whilst maintaining cardiac output. Finally, bulk RNA-seq analysis of left ventricular tissue revealed upregulation of four genes in STZ- diabetic + RH compared to STZ-diabetic + RS, which relate to remod- eling seen in diabetic cardiomyopathy including the voltage-gated potassium transporter KCNa6.2 (adj p-value < 0.05, log2FC > 0).

**Conclusion:**
Together, our data provides the first evidence that recur- rent hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes may exacerbate the effect of hyperglycaemia to induce microvascular dysfunction and lead to early signs of heart failure. These findings highlight the importance of further understanding the role of recurrent hypoglycaemia in CVD and developing novel strategies that minimise hypoglycaemia expo- sure in type 1 diabetes.

**Evaluating the long-term risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in type 1 diabetes: the role of albuminuria and diastolic impairment**

E.K. Frimodt-Møller, Rossing, M.T. Jensen

**Background and aims:**
In individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), albuminuria identifies a subgroup at high risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. This may be mediated through myocardial impairment, particularly affecting diastolic function, contributing to adverse outcomes. However, whether the combined impact of kidney and diastolic impairment synergistically contributes to long-term cardiovascular risk remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in individuals with T1D who have either albuminuria, diastolic impair- ment, or both, compared to those with T1D without albuminuria and diastolic impairment.

**Materials and methods:**
A prospective cohort of individuals with T1D without known cardiac disease underwent clinical examinations and echocardiography between 2010 and 2012. Individuals with left ventricular ejection fraction <40% were excluded from the present analysis (n=8). Albuminuria was defined as a 24-hour urine albu- min excretion rate >30 mg or a morning albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g in two out of three consecutive measurements. Diastolic impairment was classified as E/e’ ≥8. Follow-up was conducted using Danish national registries, with the primary outcome being MACE (a composite of incident hospital admission for ischemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke, or all-cause mortality). Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models assessed the association between diastolic impairment and MACE risk stratified by albuminu- ria status. Adjustments included age, sex, diabetes duration, systolic blood pressure, statin use, HbA1c, eGFR, smoking status, and regular exercise (≥3.5 hours/week).

**Results:**
A total of 1,085 participants were included. The mean (stand- ard deviation) age was 49.6 (14.5) years, 48% were women, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of diabetes was 26.2 (15.2- 37.2) years. Albuminuria was present in 327 (30%) participants, and 364 (34%) had diastolic impairment. During a median follow-up of 13.0 (IQR 12.6-13.7) years, 263 MACEs were detected. The risk of MACE increased incrementally across the groups from those with- out albuminuria and normal diastolic function (reference group) to those with either albuminuria (hazard ratio [HR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0, p<0.001) or diastolic impairment (HR 3.4, 95% CI 2.4-4.8, p<0.001), to those with both albuminuria and diastolic impairment (HR 6.2, 95% CI 4.6-8.7, p<0.001). These results remained significant after adjust- ment (Figure).

**Conclusion:**
In individuals with T1D, the long-term risk of MACE was highest in those with both albuminuria and diastolic impairment, exceeding the risk seen in those without impairment or with either condition alone. These findings suggest a harmful synergistic cardio- renal effect, highlighting the need for strict risk factor management in this group.

2. University of Leeds, Leeds, UK, Medical Biochemistry and Molecular

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus (DM) doubles the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), highlighting the need for deeper insights into molecular changes in the arterial wall. We aimed to define and validate DM-associated transcriptomic differences in the arterial wall.

**Materials and methods:**
We compared participants with versus with- out DM in the GTEx cohort study, using thoracic aorta ( ) and tibial artery ( ) RNA-sequencing data. We applied DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with false discovery rate . Metascape was used for functional enrich- ment analysis of DEGs. To validate DEGs shared by aorta and tibial artery, we used plasma proteomics data from UK Biobank ( ) to define directionally concordant differential expression in people with DM. For concordant hits we defined association with cardiovascular disease phenotypes (using linear or Cox regression).

**Results:**
In thoracic aorta, there were 619 DEGs with the top functional enrichment term being ‘endothelial dysfunction’ (log10(p)= -11). In tibial artery, there were 356 DEGs, with the top functional enrichment term being ‘defense response to virus’ (log10(p)=-12). There were 22 directionally concordant DEGs shared by thoracic aorta and tibial artery; of these, 5 were present in the UK Biobank plasma proteomics dataset: ACP5, LILRA5, PSME2 (up), OXCT1 and LEFTY2 (down). All, except OXCT1, showed directionally concordant differences in plasma protein concentration in people with DM. Higher concentra- tions of ACP5, LILRA5, PSME2 and LEFTY2 were associated with higher vascular stiffness, body mass index, diastolic blood pressure (BP), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein. Additionally, higher ACP5, LILRA5 and PSME2 correlated positively with carotid intima media thickness, HbA1c and systolic BP. The 4 plasma proteins were associated with risk of incident myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and CV and all-cause mortality in the entire population; however, the magnitude of these hazard ratios often differed between people with and without diabetes (Table 1).

**Conclusion:**
The arterial wall is transcriptionally distinct in people with DM. However, only a small proportion of DEGs were shared across aorta and tibial artery. These show potential as circulating bio- markers and may inform therapeutic developments.

**Role of 3-hydroxisobutyrate in cardiometabolic disease**

V. Casagrande, Internò, M. Federici, R. Menghini

**Background and aims:**
The valine catabolite 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (3HIB) was shown to promote insulin resistance in skeletal muscle by increasing lipid content in vivo. Translating this finding to cardio- vascular system, it might be hypothesized that 3-HIB deranges trans- endothelial fatty acid transport with potential clinical implications.

**Materials and methods:**
To measure the impact of 3-HIB on the development and progression of complex atherosclerotic lesions in vivo in mouse models, ApoE-/- mice were fed a standard laboratory diet (SD) or a Western Diet (WD) for 12 weeks starting at 8 weeks of age to induce atherosclerosis, in presence or not of 3-HIB (300mg/kg, i.p injected 3 times a week) (n=6 per group).

**Results:**
At the end of the treatment WD+3HIB mice showed a sig- nificant reduction in weight and serum triglycerides content compared to WD mice. Moreover, acylcarnitine profile analysis, performed in serum samples, indicated a significantly decrease in C6-DC and hydroxylated long-chain acylcarnitines in ApoE-/- WD+3HIB mice compared to WD fed mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining performed on aortic roots showed a reduction in aortic mean plaque area in WD- 3HIB treated mice compare to WD mice. To provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the role of 3HIB, aorta RNA seq analysis was performed (n=6 per group). Biological pro- cess enrichment analysis revealed significant modulation of several pathways, including circadian rhythm, calcium signalling, membrane potential regulation. Preliminary RT-PCR experiments confirmed the significant increase of NR1D2 and decrease of CRY1, CCL2 and NOS2 expression in WD+3HIB mice compared to WD. Next, mRNA expres- sion levels of oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and circadian rhythm genes were evaluated in liver. The preliminary obtained results suggest a significant improvement of liver functions induced by 3HIB treat- ment under WD conditions and confirmed the modulation of genes involved in circadian rhythm. Finally, preliminary results show that, in HepG2 cells, 3-HIB treatment improved intracellular acetyl-CoA levels and fatty acid oxidation rates measured by seahorse extracellular flux analyzer whereby ATP generation, and induced the modulation of circadian genes expression, suggesting a direct link that is under investigation.

**Conclusion:**
In contrast to elevated levels of endogenous 3-HIB serum levels during metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, the 3-HIB treat- ment is associated to a protective effects involving at least in part the modulation of circadian genes.

**Background and aims:**
As the burden of diabetes grows, advancing biomarker research is crucial for improving diagnosis, monitoring and treatment strategies. Based on proteomics analysis, we have previously identified 50 proteins highly associated with micro- and macrovascular complications (CX) in people with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this work, we utilised transcriptomic technology to measure mRNA expression of those proteins, allowing further analysis of transcriptional regulation and pathway activation underlying vascular CX in T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Total RNA was extracted from citrate plasma samples of 543 individuals with T2D from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial (mean±SD: age: 62±7 yrs; T2D duration: 6±6 yrs; HbA1c: 6.8±1.3%). 224 participants had microCX, 142 had macroCX (51 had both types of CX) and 228 had no CX. mRNA expression was quantified using the OpenArray platform and group differences were analysed using ΔΔCT values. Pathway analysis was conducted using DAVID software. Neutrophil elastase (NE) protein levels were measured using ELISA.

**Results:**
Genes (11) detectable in >20% samples were selected for analysis. In the microCX group, the most pronounced gene expres- sion changes vs. the no CX group were observed for clusterin (CLU) (~2-fold upregulation) and integrin alpha-IIb (~50% downregulation). Similarly, in the macroCX group, CLU exhibited the strongest upregu- lation (~2.5-fold), while apolipoprotein F showed the greatest reduc- tion (~20%). Comparative analysis of proteomic and transcriptomic data across study groups revealed that only 32% of gene expression changes (vs no CX) were mirrored at the protein level ­(R =0.02), e.g. talin1 showed reduced mRNA and protein expression in individuals who developed micro- and/or macroCX. Gene expression changes not reflected at the protein level suggested potential post-transcriptional or -translational regulation. Pathway analysis identified actin protein (ACTN) as a central node in all enriched pathways, with six of our studied proteins implicated in actin regulation, polymerisation, and recruitment. The neutrophil extracellular trap formation pathway emerged as a key finding, underscoring the role of NE in ACTN deg- radation. NE ELISA levels correlated inversely with actin protein expression ­(R =0.92). Higher NE was associated with greater actin degradation, highlighting the NE-ACTN axis as a potential pathogenic mechanism in CX and a promising therapeutic target.

**Conclusion:**
These findings underscore the importance of integrating transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to better understand the molecu- lar mechanisms driving vascular complications in T2D and to identify potential therapeutic targets.

**Background and aims:**
Vascular endothelial ferroptosis is a key mech- anism underlying endothelial injury and atherosclerotic plaque forma- tion. Dapagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2, is widely used in the treatment of diabetes and heart failure. Dapagliflozin has been shown to delay atherosclerosis progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to eluci- date the molecular pathways whereby dapagliflozin inhibits vascular endothelial ferroptosis.

**Materials and methods:**
We utilized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to construct a cell model of atherosclerosis combined with ferroptosis. At the animal level, we constructed an atherosclerosis model by using ; double-knockout mice.

**Results:**
Dapagliflozin significantly decreased the iron and malondi- aldehyde levels and the release of inflammatory factors in HUVECs treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein or Erastin but increased the superoxide dismutase activity and the reduced glutathione / oxi- dized glutathione ratio. Results from transmission electron micros- copy indicated that dapagliflozin alleviated the mitochondrial shrink- age and the reduction in the number of cristae in these HUVECs. RNA sequencing revealed that dapagliflozin upregulates . experiments showed that RAP1B upregulates NRF2 and pro- motes its nuclear translocation, activating the xCT/GPX4 signaling pathway and inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Additionally, dapagliflozin induces mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances oxidative phospho- rylation through the RAP1B/NRF2 pathway, reducing iron overload and excessive production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, ultimately mitigating ferroptosis. We confirmed that dapagli- flozin upregulates GPX4 and key factors of mitochondrial biogenesis via RAP1B, promoting oxidative phosphorylation. When mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was pharmacologically inhibited, ferroptosis was reactivated, promoting atherosclerotic plaque formation.

**Conclusion:**
Dapagliflozin promotes the nuclear translocation of NRF2 by upregulating RAP1B, enhances the xCT/GPX4 signaling pathway, and facilitates mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS. This improvement in mitochondrial energy metabolism reduces mtROS pro- duction, ultimately inhibiting the ferroptosis process. These findings provide new evidence for the clinical application of dapagliflozin and offer novel insights into the prevention and treatment of endothelial ferroptosis.

**Background and aims:**
In older individuals, a more androgenic profile is associated with reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in men, but greater risk in women. Sex hormones change in response to inten- sive weight loss interventions in people with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). This study examines the impact of endogenous sex hormone levels at baseline and one year after an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and weight loss on CVD over 12 years among adults with overweight and T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
LookAHEAD evaluated an ILI vs. diabetes support and education (DSE) for weight loss and CV outcomes in 5,145 individuals with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² and T2D. The trial’s primary out- come was CVD defined as a composite of death due to CVD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalization for angina. In this Ancillary Study, we randomly selected 2,334 participants (50% post- menopausal female; 50% older males, aged 45-76 years). We used mass spectrometry to measure testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2), ELISA to measure sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Bioavail- able testosterone (bioT) was calculated using the Vermeulen equation. For this analysis, the exposures were sex hormones at baseline and the change of hormone from baseline to year 1, divided into sex-specific tertiles. Cox regression models were used to assess the association between the sex hormones and the primary outcome.

**Results:**
Baseline sex hormone levels in both sexes were not associ- ated with future CVD. In females, changes in all sex hormones after year 1 were not associated with CVD. In females, the point estimate for the highest E2 change tertile versus the combined ­1 and second tertiles was protective, though not statistically significant. In males, the highest tertile for change in E2 was associated with CVD (HR= 1.44, p=0.010). In males, the increases in total T, SHBG and bioT were not associated with CVD.

**Conclusion:**
Some changes in sex hormones due to an intensive weight loss intervention were associated with risk of future CVD in older males, but not postmenopausal females with T2D. In males only, an increase in E2 was associated with CVD risk.

**Background and aims:**
Socio-economic status (SES) is linked to health outcomes but remains challenging to measure. The conventional approach, relying on SES indices for large geographical units (e.g., postcodes), may overlook SES effects detectable at smaller scales.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed Australian participants from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study. SES was assessed using percentile rankings of SES indices for areas (SEIFA, published every 5 years by the Australian Bureau of Sta- tistics following each national census) derived from small geographical units (~400 people). Higher values indicate better / less disadvantaged SES. This percentile-based ranking approach preserves relative SES positioning over time, reducing inconsistencies in SEIFA calculations across census periods.

**Results:**
Among 5,147 FIELD participants, higher SES (measured by the index of relative socio-economic disadvantage [IRSD] and index of economic resources [IER]) was associated with a lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline and during 5 years of follow- up (FUP). The median rank (95% CI) IRSD for participants with no prior CVD at baseline was 50.9 (25.4-76.7) vs 42.7 (19.9-68.4) centile for those with history of CVD; p<0.0001. IER was 55.9 (30.5-79.5) vs 46.9 (23.6-73.2) centile respectively; p<0.0001. Higher SES was also linked to lower incidence of new CVD events during follow-up: the IRSD was 49.4 (24.7-75.5) vs 46.4 (21.6-69.1) centile; p=0.017, and IER: 54.8 (29.4-78.4) vs 49.7 (25.5-74.9) centile; p=0.039 for those without vs those with new CVD events during FUP. These differences were observed when data from 2 earlier censuses were analysed (i.e. 10 years before enrolment in FIELD). IRSD was 57.3 (30.8-81.1) vs 55.62 (27.1-77.4) centile; p=0.037, IER: 62.8 (35.8-83.7) vs 59.8 (33.9-79.2) centile; p=0.024 in those without vs. with new CVD, respectively. When SES was assessed based on data from larger geographical units (postcode, ~10,000 people), there was no association with on-trial CVD (IRSD: 56.4 (25.8-80.4) vs 58.1 (26.9-77.3) centile; p=0.75, IER: 65.2 (38.9-82.8) vs 63.4 (39.7-80.3) centile; p=0.53) in those without vs. with new CVD, respectively. They were also not observed in earlier census results (IRSD: 52.1 (24.3-80.75) vs 46.73 (23.4-77.9) centile; p=0.077, IER: 64.0 (42-8-84.0) vs 60 (42.8-80.5) centile; p=0.074 for without vs with new CVD, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Assessing SES at smaller geographical scales using census data offers a more nuanced understanding of SES disparities and their health impacts. Our approach highlights the need for greater granularity in SES when analysing the link between SES and health outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), a simple, cost-effective marker of insulin resistance, has been recognised as an emerging prognostic biomarker in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vali- dation of clinically relevant cut-off values in primary and secondary prevention and of its incremental value over established risk scores is needed to define its applicability in clinical practice. We aimed to explore the associations of TyG with traits of increased cardiometa- bolic risk, and externally validate the incremental value of a derived optimal cut-off value over established risk scores.

**Materials and methods:**
In an ongoing registry aiming to stratify CVD risk (Athens Angiometabolic Study), we analysed 1,170 con- secutively recruited patients (mean age 58.9 years, 57.1% male) (deri- vation cohort). TyG was calculated by the formula: ln[fasting triglyc- erides (mg/dL) x fasting glucose (mg/dL)/2]. Indices of subclinical arterial injury (carotid wall thickness for subclinical atherosclerosis, pulse wave velocity (PWV) for arterial stiffness), the progression of atherosclerosis and the incidence of all-cause mortality were used as endpoints. Because we found increased TyG to incrementally predict mortality only in our primary prevention cohort, for external validation, we included a general population cohort after excluding patients with established CVD (Attica cohort, n=1,879). Participants were followed for a median of 4 and 10 years for all-cause mortality in derivation and validation cohorts, respectively.

**Results:**
Elevated TyG index was independently associated with higher number of diseased vascular beds [odds ratio (OR)=2.00], maximal carotid wall thickness (maxWT)>2mm (OR=1.57) and PWV>10m/s (OR=1.51), peripheral and aortic diastolic blood pressure and with increased preperitoneal and subcutaneous fat thickness (P<0.05 for all). Increased TyG associated with accelerated progression of the number of carotid plaques (OR=2.99) and of maxWT (i.e OR=4.37 for >50% increase of maxWT) at follow-up (P<0.05 for both). A TyG index≥8.53 was independently associated with increased risk for all-cause mortal- ity only in the primary prevention subgroup (n=666) of the derivation cohort (HR=10.84, P=0.003). This derived cut-off conferred incre- mental prognostic value over Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) both in the derivation (deltaAUC=0.067, P=0.003) and validation cohort (deltaAUC=0.065, P<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
In a population with a wide range of cardiometabolic risk, TyG was associated with increased prevalence and progression of sub- clinical arterial injury and an adverse metabolic profile. In individuals assessed for primary prevention, a TyG≥8.53 conferred incremental value over a well-established guidelines-recommended score, support- ing its clinical applicability in this setting.

**Background and aims:**
Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a promising bio- marker in CV disease, providing insights into vascular health. Defined as the velocity at which the pulse wave propagates along the arterial tree, it represents an index of arterial stiffness (AS) and vascular aging. A formula using age and mean BP, the main determinants of AS, has been developed to estimate PWV (ePWV). This observational, pro- spective, monocentric study evaluated the association of ePWV with incidence of major CV events and all-cause death in a cohort of T2D over a 13-year follow-up.

**Materials and methods:**
Vital status and data for CV events (98.5% of patients) were retrieved in 961 T2D. ePWV was stratified by quar- tiles (Qs, Q1 as reference). K-M curves were built by ePWV Qs. HRs according to ePWV (Qs or continuous variable) were estimated by Cox hazards sequentially adjusted for age, sex and hypertension (Model 1), plus diabetes duration (DD), smoking, HbA1c, BMI, dyslipidemia (Model 2), and plus DKD phenotype, DR grade and prior CV events (Model 3).

**Results:**
At baseline, ePWV Qs ­(25 , ­50 , ­75 percentiles: 9.22, 10.30, 11.30 m/sec) did not differ for BMI, HbA1c, lipids, hsCRP, fibrinogen, dyslipidaemia and retinopathy rates. DD, sBP, dBP, hypertension, uACR (p<0.0001 for all), uric acid (p=0.036), periph- eral neuropathy and prior CVD steeply increased across Qs; eGFR (p<0.0001) and active smokers decreased steeply. We registered 229 deaths (23.8%), 273 major CV events (28.8%), 181 coronary events (CHD: 19.1%), 82 hospitalizations for heart failure (hHF: 8.7%), 101 cerebrovascular events (CVE: 10.7%), 39 peripheral artery diseases (PAD: 4.1%), 71 ESKD (7.5%). Across ePWV Qs, all-cause death increased from 8.7 to 37.1% (K-M, p<0.0001), major CV events from 22.4 to 38.0% (p<0.0001), CHD from 16.9 to 26.2% (p=0.004), hHF from 3.0 to 16.5% (p<0.0001), CVE from 6.8 to 13.5% (p=0.022), PAD from 1.3 to 7.2% (in Q3, p=0.004), ESKD from 3.4% to 12.2% (p<0.0001). Based on unadjusted Cox, Q2-Q4 ePWV was associated with a 2.7-, 3.4-, and 5.0-fold increased risk of death; however, ePWV (Qs or continuous) was never an independent covariate of death in any regression model. Consistently, ePWV (Qs or continuous) was never an independent covariate of hHF. Nearly uniformly, in all regression models, Qs of ePWV were found to be independent predictors of CVD, CHD, ECV, PAD, and ESRD. In the more complex model (Model 3), Q3 (HR 1.43; 95% CI 0.99-2.06, p=0.056) and Q4 (HR 1.93, 1.34- 2.76, p<0.0001) were independent predictors of CVD; Q4 (HR 1.63, 1.07-2.48, p=0.024) was associated with CHD; Q3 (HR 1.99, 1.08- 3.67, p=0.028) and Q4 (HR 2.08, 1.12-3.89, p=0.021) were predic- tors of CVE; Q3 (HR 6.86, 1.98-23.81, p=0.002) and Q4 (HR 4.91, 1.36-17.72, p=0.015) were related to PAD. Finally, marginally Q2 (HR 2.05, 0.86-4.90, p=0.105) and significantly Q3 (HR 2.53, 1.09-5.88, p=0.030) and Q4 (HR 4.14, 1.85-9.31, p=0.001) were predictors of ESRD. In Model 3, each m/sec increase in ePWV was associated with increased adjusted risk of CVD (+19%), CHD (+13%), CVE (+22%), PAD (+43%), ESRD (27%).

**Conclusion:**
Overall, these findings suggest that ePWV may represent an easily available tool for predicting the occurrence of major vascular events in T2D, beyond traditional CV risk factors.

**Risk profile of heart failure in people with type 2 diabetes: clinical parameters and patient perspectives**

J.-F. Raposo, mento do Ó, M. Silva, S. Santo, S. Ferreira, M. Barros, J.M. Boavida, P. Matos

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes is a common feature in people with heart failure (HF), and people with type 2 diabetes present a two to five-fold risk of developing HF. However, it remains underrecognized as a complication of diabetes compared to other related conditions. Natriuretic peptides are hormones produced in response to increased hemodynamic stress, thus, measuring blood levels of NT-proBNP and other natriuretic peptides has been shown to provide valuable diagnos- tic and prognostic biomarkers for HF. Expanding clinical knowledge on personalized HF risk assessment and exploring the awareness of people with type 2 diabetes, is, therefore, crucial. This study aims to determine the risk level for HF in individuals with type 2 diabetes by quantifying NT-proBNP, and assessing cardiac changes in those identified as at risk.

**Materials and methods:**
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenience sample of adults with type 2 diabetes from a diabetes specialized clinic. NT-proBNP levels were measured in venous blood using the Cobas h232 device (Roche), alongside the collection of sociodemographic, clinical, and healthcare resource utilization data. Participants also completed questionnaires on lifestyle, health literacy, and patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), including self-perception of cardiac health. Individuals with NT-proBNP levels above 125 pg/mL, as per clinical guidelines, were referred for echocardiography (GE VIVID T8).

**Results:**
The study included 500 individuals with type 2 diabetes, with a mean age of 61.8±8.0 years, 45.6% of whom were female. Among them, 116 individuals (23.2%) had NT-proBNP levels exceeding the established cut-off, with similar distribution across gender. Of these, 86.2% consented to undergo the echocardiographic exam. Among those evaluated, 71.0% exhibited significant cardiac abnormalities, including diastolic dysfunction (63.4%), reduced ejection fraction (6.1%), and mildly reduced ejection fraction (4.9%). NT-proBNP values showed a positive correlation with age, duration of diabetes, and treatment, while having a negative correlation with lifestyle aspects.

**Conclusion:**
The present study underscores the value of NT-proBNP measurement in the early detection of heart failure in individuals with type 2 diabetes, even in the absence of symptoms, facilitating timely and personalized interventions. This includes providing an opportunity for an informed approach with patients to lifestyle habits.

3. versity of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK, University of Glasgow, Glasgow,

**Background and aims:**
The relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF) is well established, yet the extent to which HF prevalence has changed over time in individuals with DM remains unclear. Advances in diabetes care, cardiovascular thera- pies, and evolving population health trends may have influenced HF prevalence across different time periods. A systematic evalua- tion of temporal changes is essential to better understand the shift- ing burden of HF in DM. This study aimed to assess trends in HF prevalence among individuals with DM through a meta-analysis of population-based studies, while accounting for heterogeneity and potential sources of bias.

**Materials and methods:**
A systematic review, registered on PROS- PERO, was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Original stud- ies published between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2023, were identified through PubMed and EMBASE. Eligible studies included general population cohorts (≥1,000 participants) of individuals with DM from all countries that reported HF diagnosis. Study screening and data extraction were performed independently by at least two researchers. The pooled prevalence of HF was estimated using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation and analysed across two distinct time periods (1990-2004 and 2005-2020) to assess tem- poral trends.

**Results:**
Of 19,680 titles and abstracts screened, 1,614 full-text articles were assessed, and 35 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 studies included data from 1990-2004, and 25 from 2005-2020. The overall pooled prevalence of HF was 11.3% (95% CI: 8.3-14.8) among 1.2 million patients with DM in 1990-2004, compared to 6.1% (95% CI: 4.7-7.7) among 5 million patients with DM in 2005-2020. Age-stratified analysis for 1990-2004 showed HF prevalence of 8.4% (95% CI: 4.0-14.3) in studies with a mean age <65 years, and 13.2% (95% CI: 9.6-17.2) in those ≥65 years. Corresponding estimates for 2005-2020 were 4.4% (95% CI: 3.2-5.8) and 8.7% (95% CI: 6.4-11.3), respectively.

**Conclusion:**
This meta-analysis suggests a decline in HF preva- lence among individuals with DM over time, potentially reflecting improvements in diabetes and cardiovascular care. However, sub- stantial heterogeneity (I² = 99.99%), differences in study design, population characteristics, and diagnostic criteria limit the robust- ness of these findings. The observed trends may reflect methodologi- cal variability rather than true epidemiological shifts, with mixed diabetes populations (predominantly type 2 DM) and age-related factors further confounding estimates. Meta-regression techniques could help address these confounding factors. Further research is needed to investigate the prevalence of HF subtypes and age-specific trends in more homogenous cohorts.

6. en’s Hospital, Cambridge, MA, USA, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX,

**Background and aims:**
Heart failure (HF) is common in diabetes and may be asymptomatic in earlier stages. NT-proBNP and BNP [col- lectively natriuretic peptides (NP)] detect early HF in asymptomatic individuals who could benefit from disease-modifying therapies. We examined the prognostic value of NP levels in people with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 (T2D) diabetes without known HF.

**Materials and methods:**
We retrospectively evaluated adults (≥18 years) with T1D or T2D using Optum’s de-identified Market Clarity Data who received an outpatient NP test between 2017-2023 with- out known HF at time of testing. We categorized BNP levels as <50, 50-100 or >100 and NT-proBNP levels as <125, 125-300 or >300. We assessed the association between NP levels and HF development or death using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for age, sex, race comorbidities and region.

**Results:**
Among 116,439 people (3,284 with T1D and 113,155 with T2D) who met inclusion criteria and were followed up to 7 years, 54% were female, had a median (IQR) age of 64 (55-74) and a mean (SD) A1c of 7.2% (1.8) at baseline. Overall, 28,239 indi- viduals (24%) had incident HF or death during follow-up (median 26 months). Roughly 18% of people with T1D and 19% with T2D had BNP 50-100 or NT-proBNP 125-300; 22% of those with T1D and 23% with T2D had BNP >100 or NT-proBNP >300. In adjusted Cox models, increased NT-ProBNP was significantly associated with increased risk of HF development or mortality among individuals with T1D (HR [95% CI] NT-ProBNP 125-300: 2.06 [1.40-3.06]; >300: 5.25 [3.75-7.36], ref: NT-ProBNP<125) and T2D (HR [95% CI] NT-ProBNP 125-300: 1.90 [1.79-2.02]; >300: 3.70 [3.51-3.91]). BNP showed a similar prognostic pattern.

**Conclusion:**
These data demonstrate that NP test results in individu- als with DM without HF are highly prognostic for future risk of HF or mortality. The study supports implementation of NP testing for HF risk assessment in people with T1D and T2D for optimal manage- ment and improved outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Discrimination between atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure risk should guide therapy in type 2 diabetes. We aimed to develop and validate a new, multi- outcome CVD risk score for this purpose.

**Materials and methods:**
The development cohort was a subgroup of the REWIND CVD outcomes trial placebo arm with no back- ground SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist therapy (N=3975; mean age 66±7 years, 52% men), followed for a median 5.4 years for two major CVD outcomes: MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD death) and a composite of heart failure hospitalisation (HHF) or CVD death (HHF/CVdth). The most predictive risk factors for each outcome were selected based on their influence on the Cox regression model cross-validated C-statistic (≥0.005 increment). The models for MACE and HHF/CVdth were externally validated in 9551 participants with type 2 diabetes in the ORIGIN trial. “High” vs. “low” risk classifications for each outcome were based on a cutpoint of 10% for estimated 5-year risk.

**Results:**
MACE (n=548; 28 per 1000 person-years) was more fre- quent than HHF/CVdth overall (n=439; 22 per 1000 person-years). Nine risk factors were selected for MACE and six for HHF/CVdth prediction (10 total, accounting for overlap; associations with each outcome displayed in Figure panel A). Age, prior heart fail- ure, urine albumin/creatinine ratio and prior atrial fibrillation were more strongly associated with HHF/CVdth, compared with MACE. Conversely, prior myocardial infarction, prior stroke, systolic BP, and LDL cholesterol were more strongly associated with MACE, compared with HHF/CVdth. Most individuals in the development cohort had similar predicted risks of MACE and HHF/CVdth, with 48% classified as low risk and 30% classified as high risk of both outcomes. However, 19% had high estimated MACE risk coupled with low estimated HHF/CVdth risk, and 2.5% vice versa. Observed incidence rates were consistent with these predicted discrepancies in risk; i.e. MACE was more frequent in the group classified as high risk of MACE, but low risk of HHF/CVdth, while HHF/CVdth was more frequent in the group classified as high risk of HHF/CVdth, but low risk of MACE (Figure panel B). C-indices for the MACE and HHF/CVdth models were 0.70 and 0.73, respectively, with simi- lar performances in the validation cohort (0.67 for MACE [n=1569 events] and 0.68 for HHF/CVdth [n=1236 events]).

**Conclusion:**
Differentiation between MACE and HHF/CVdth risk in type 2 diabetes is possible from clinical risk factors alone. This novel risk score provides comparable risk estimates for both outcomes and may be useful in targeting individuals more likely to benefit from spe- cific therapies.

**Incidence and associates of aortic valve replacement in people with or without type 2 diabetes: the Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II**

T.M.E. Davis

**Background and aims:**
Although there is evidence that diabetes increases the risk of aortic stenosis, data relating to the relative inci- dence of aortic valve replacement (AVR) are sparse. The aim of this study was to utilise data from the longitudinal observational Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II (FDS2) to examine the association between type 2 diabetes and incident AVR and to investigate potential risk fac- tors in adults with type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We followed 1,430 participants with type 2 diabetes in the FDS2 cohort (mean age 66 years, 53% males) and 5,720 age-, sex- and postcode-matched people without known diabetes from entry between 2008 and 2011 to end-2021 for AVR ascertained from relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9-CM or the later Australian Classification of Health Interventions procedure codes in validated linked databases. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated. Cox proportional hazards and competing risk models gen- erated cause-specific (cs) and subdistribution (sd) hazard ratios (HRs) for incident AVR.

**Results:**
At baseline, 11 of the 1,430 participants with type 2 diabe- tes in the FDS2 cohort (0.8%) and 37 of 5,720 in the matched cohort without diabetes (0.6%) had already undergone AVR ( =0.589). Excluding those with prior AVR, there were 24 (1.7%) and 40 (0.7%) incident AVR hospitalisations in those with and without type 2 diabetes, respectively, during 73,498 person-years of follow-up ( =0.001). The IRs and IRRs by age groups and for the total cohorts are shown in the Figure. The overall IRR was 2.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38, 4.08), =0.0007), with the largest AVR numbers and significant IRR by age group in those aged 71-80 years (2.61 (1.15-5.72)). In pooled regression analyses, type 2 diabetes had a csHR and sdHR that were similar (2.38 (1.43, 3.96) and 2.34 (1.41, 3.88)), with increasing age (an effect that attenuated in time-vary- ing analysis) and male sex as the other significant covariates in the models. In those with type 2 diabetes, incident AVR was bivariably associated with baseline blood glucose-lowering treatment intensity ( =0.003), distal symmetrical polyneuropathy ( =0.005), prior cer- ebrovascular disease ( =0.043) and plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; =0.009).

**Conclusion:**
Type 2 diabetes more than doubles the risk of AVR even after adjusting for the competing risk of death. People with type 2 diabetes who required AVR were more intensively managed and had more complications at baseline. A raised plasma NT-proBNP may be a useful indicator of the future need for AVR in type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
The prevalence and burden of type 2 diabe- tes (T2D) keep rising, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the lead- ing cause of mortality. A common denominator of CVD is extracel- lular matrix changes. The pro-inflammatory molecule endotrophin, released during collagen type VI formation, has been associated with adverse outcomes in people with T2D. We investigated whether the association between endotrophin and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is independent of contemporary risk factors and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP).

**Materials and methods:**
Endotrophin levels were measured with the PRO-C6 ELISA in serum from 909 participants with T2D included in the Thousand&2 Study. The primary endpoint was MACE (all- cause mortality or hospital admission for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or stroke). The association between baseline PRO-C6 levels and the risk of MACE was evaluated in three Cox models. Model 1) unadjusted. Model 2) adjusted for age, sex, diabetes dura- tion, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, eGFR, albuminuria, treatment with statins, and smoking. Model 3) as Model 2, plus NTproBNP.

**Results:**
Baseline mean (±SD) age was 65 (±10) years, 65% were males, with median (IQR) PRO-C6 10.0 (8.0-13.7) ng/mL and median (IQR) NTproBNP 194 (85-421) pg/mL. During a median fol- low-up of 5.0 years (IQR: 4.5 to 5.0 years), 227 MACE events were recorded. The hazard ratios (HR) with [95% confidence intervals] per doubling of PRO-C6 were: Model 1) 2.0 [1.8-2.4], P <0.001. Model 2) 1.6 [1.2-2.1], P =0.001. Model 3) 1.4 [1.1-1.8], P =0.01.

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that, in individuals with T2D, higher endotrophin, quantified by PRO-C6, is a risk marker for MACE, independent of contemporary risk factors and NTproBNP.

**Background and aims:**
Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for cardiovascular events and experience poor outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). While randomized trials have shown no benefit of immediate coronary angiography over initial intensive care assessment with delayed or selective angiography in resuscitated OHCA patients without ST-segment elevation, it remains unclear whether this applies to high-risk subgroups such as patients with diabetes. In this prespecified subgroup analysis of the TOMA- HAWK trial, we assessed the impact of coronary angiography timing on survival outcomes in patients with diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
TOMAHAWK was a multicenter, rand- omized controlled trial that compared immediate versus delayed/selec- tive coronary angiography in patients with OHCA of presumed cardiac origin without ST-segment elevation. The primary endpoint was death from any cause at 30 days. Kaplan-Meier event rates and Cox regres- sion were used to assess survival outcomes and test for interaction.

**Results:**
Of 530 patients included, 145 (27.4%) had diabetes. Diabetes patients were more likely to be older (74 versus 66 years), have hyper- tension (86% versus 68%), prior coronary artery disease (50% versus 32%), myocardial infarction (27% versus 17%), peripheral artery dis- ease (23% versus 6%), and heart failure (31% versus 15%; all P<0.05). They also had longer no-flow times (10 versus 5 minutes, P=0.044) and a lower incidence of shockable rhythms (45% versus 59%, P=0.010), but there was no significant difference in baseline troponin T levels (154 versus 152 ng/L).Diabetes was associated with higher 30-day mortality (66% vs. 45%, P<0.001) and remained independently associ- ated after multivariable adjustment (Adj. HR 1.39; 95% CI, 1.02-1.91). Immediate (versus delayed/selective) coronary angiography was not associated with lower risk of death in patients with diabetes (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.89) nor in those without (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.86; P value for interaction=0.80).

**Conclusion:**
Diabetes is associated with substantially increased mor- tality in OHCA patients without ST-segment elevation. Immediate coronary angiography did not confer a survival benefit in this high-risk subgroup. These findings reinforce the overall trial result and highlight the need for further research into tailored post-resuscitation strategies in high-risk populations.

**Ten-year trends in diabetic patients hospitalised for acute myo- cardial infarction**

P.-S. Song

**Background and aims:**
Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at high risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite an overall trend of reduced mortality after AMI, the mortality gap between AMI patients with and without DM did not decrease over time in previous analyses. We assessed the most recent trends in outcomes for patients with AMI according to DM status.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed data from the 2 Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registries (KAMIRs), KAMIR-NIH (enrolled between November 2011 and December 2015, early period) and KAMIR-V (enrolled from January 2016 to June 2020, late period), contemporary registries of AMI patients treated in tertiary hospitals with facilities for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

**Results:**
The study comprised 28,990 AMI patients, including 10,128 (34.9%) with DM. The prevalence of DM in the study cohort tends to be increased from 34.5% in early period to 35.3% in late period (adjusted odd ratios [OR], 1.045; =0.079 for trend). The provision of secondary prevention agents rose significantly in both groups between early and late period; Reperfusion with PCI rates also increased over the study period in both groups. Thanks to advances in evidence- based therapies and their delivery between 2011 and 2020, impressive declines in in-hospital mortality occurred in those with (from 5.2% in early period to 4.0% in late period; adjusted OR, 0.748; =0.003 for trend) and without DM (from 3.5% in early period to 2.9% in late period; adjusted OR, 0.794; =0.006 for trend). These improvements were sustained at 12 months in both groups (from 12.3% in early period to 7.8% in late period; adjusted OR, 0.628; <0.001 for trend in patients with diabetes; from 7.7% in early period to 5.1% in late period; adjusted OR, 0.659; <0.001 for trend in patients without diabetes).

**Conclusion:**
The in-hospital and 12-months mortality gaps between AMI patients with and without DM narrowed significantly from 2011 to 2020. These data suggest that despite the continually increasing prevalence of DM and the persistent incremental cardiovascular risk associated with DM, sustained efforts at implementing evidence-based therapies and improving the care afforded to these patients can help close the gap in adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with DM.

3. cine, ZhongDa Hospital, Nanjing, China, Department of Critical Care

**Background and aims:**
Effective glycemic management is crucial for critically ill patients. However, the optimal glucose control target and the relationship between time in range (TIR) and mortality remain con- troversial. This study aimed to explore the association between different definitions of TIR and 28-day mortality in surgical critically ill patients.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective cohort study included 685 patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) between January 2020 and December 2023. Three different definitions of Time in Range, namely 3.9-10.0 mmol/L, 6.1-10.0 mmol/L, and 7.8-10.0 mmol/L, were used to assess glucose variability. The primary outcome in this study was 28-day mortality. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the association between TIR and 28-day mortality.

**Results:**
Patients were stratified by HbA1c levels into two groups: HbA1c < 6.5% and HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. The sex, BMI, Apache II, and reasons for ICU admission were comparable between the two groups. In the HbA1c < 6.5% group, ­TIR was associated with decreased mortality odds (adjusted OR = 0.14, P = 0.003). In the HbA1c ≥ 6.5% group, ­TIR was associated with a reduced risk of 28-day mortality (adjusted OR = 0.13, P = 0.041). However, no correlation was observed between the ­TIR and 28-day mortality in either the HbA1c < 6.5% or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% groups.

**Conclusion:**
It might be helpful to consider different TIR standards for glucose variability control based on different HbA1c levels in surgical ICU patients.

**Diabetic ketoacidosis: a 10-year retrospective single-site review**

S.B. Soleim

**Background and aims:**
To estimate burden of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), identify high-risk patients and evaluate outcomes among patients with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) at a University Hospital.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective cohort study of admissions for DKA between August ­1 2012 and august ­31 2022. Clinical data were collected through review of electronic medical records.

**Results:**
We identified 178 patients with 307 DKA admissions. Median [range] age at admission was 34 years [16-92]. A history of smoking (44.9%) and substance abuse (18.0%) was prevalent. 17.1% of patients had no DM diagnosis at first admission. 138 patients (77.5%) had only one admission, whereas 10 patients (5.4%) had five or more. Multivari- ate logistic regression identified psychiatric illness (OR=3.46; 95% CI: [1.49-8.08]; p=0.004) and poor treatment compliance (OR=3.03; 95% CI [1.43-6.40]; p=0.004) as significant predictors of multiple lifetime hospitalizations. The most common precipitating causes were concur- rent infection (21.8%) and omitted insulin dose (30%). 24 admissions (7.8%) were due to insulin pump failure (three of which were Hybrid Closed Loop Systems). Median HbA1c was 88 [36-160] mmol/mol, and only in ten cases, the patient’s glycaemic targets were met (≤53 mmol/mol). The mean admission rate was 33.8 per year. There was a significant reduction in monthly DKA admissions from August 2012 to August 2022 with a 5.9% reduction per calendar year (RR=0.941; 95% CI: [0.904-0.979]; p=0.002) for a cumulative decline of approxi- mately 1.32 admissions per month over the 10-year period. Median time until ­HCO ≥18 mmol/L was 16 [2-126] hours, and until dis- charge 93.75 [15-954] hours. Several factors affected hospital length of stay, as shown in table 1. In-hospital mortality was 1.6%, and 5-year cumulative survival was 84.5% with a median age at death of 57.5 years [19.5-93.25]. A Cox regression analysis identified age at first admission (HR=1.079; 95% CI [1.047-1.113]; p<0.001), age at diabetes diagnosis (HR=0.97; 95% CI [0.944-0.997]; p=0.03), and a history of substance abuse (HR=5.054; 95% CI [2.146-11.904]; p<0.001) as significant predictors of 5-year mortality among patients admitted with DKA.

**Conclusion:**
DKA admissions decreased over the past decade. Patients typically presented with poor glycaemic control and severe DKA. While in-hospital mortality was low, five-year post-DKA mortality was considerable. Some clinical factors were significantly associated with a higher risk of multiple admissions and post-discharge mortality. Identifying risk factors and high-risk individuals is crucial for tailoring follow-up care.

2. Birmingham, UK, Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, Walsall, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus characterised by severe hyperglycaemia, serum hyperosmolarity, and dehydration with low or no ketosis. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the precipitating factors and outcomes that influence mortality with HHS, with most existing evidence being from case series or small studies. Identifying precipitating factors can empower people living with diabetes to recognise triggers and reduce the risk of HHS. Evalu- ating patient outcomes following HHS can inform the effectiveness of current management strategies. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the precipitating factors and outcomes of HHS and variation in care and outcomes globally.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a systematic review and meta-summary of all studies reporting HHS cases from the date of inception of the database until February 2025. A comprehensive search was performed across multiple databases (Ovid, PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library) follow- ing PRISMA guidelines. All articles with data on HHS were included. Data on patient demographics, biochemical data on presentation, pre- cipitants of HHS, outcomes and complications were collected. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scoring system for cohort studies, with this score adapted to assess case-control and cross- sectional studies. Data was stratified by region and country. Descriptive statistics summarised data, including medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables and counts with percentage frequencies for categorical variables.

**Results:**
A total of 489,437 HHS episodes were included across 68 studies. 95% of cases were from North America and Asia (75%, n=188,878 and 20%, n=48,847, respectively). There were fewer cases from Europe (n=7,225), Africa (n=2,376) and a paucity of cases from Oceania (n=45) and South America (n=35). The median (IQR) age of patients was 66.4 (57.3-72.0) years, and males comprised 54.5% of the sample. Caucasian and Black ethnicities were most commonly reported (n=181,797 and n=182,241, respectively). The median biochemical values on admission were: glucose 48.6 (40.5-53.75) mmol/L, osmolal- ity 350.5 (338.3-359) mOsm/kg, pH 7.38 (7.37-7.39), bicarbonate- 22.5 (20.9-23.5) mmol/L and ketones 0.0 (0.0-0.0) mmol/L. In those studies where precipitants were described, intercurrent non-infective illness (47.1%), new diabetes diagnosis (45.1%), infection (44.2%) and poor treatment compliance (36.4%) were the most frequent. Overall mortal- ity was 2.3%, ranging from 1.3% in North America to 18.2% in Asia. Median length of stay was 7.0 (4.1-11.4) days and frequency of ITU admission was 5.4%. The most frequently reported complications were: acute kidney injury (33.0%), hypoglycaemia (14.5%), rhabdomyolysis (3.3%), acute coronary syndrome (3%) and arrhythmias (2.8%).

**Conclusion:**
The burden of disease is best described in North America and Asia cases. Infection, intercurrent illness and new diabetes diag- noses form the majority of precipitants. Outcomes are most favourable in North America and Europe, with significant variation globally. It is currently unclear why this variation occurs. Future research focusing on adherence to international consensus on HHS management may help understand and reduce variation in care.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is the most common medical complication of pregnancy. Data is lacking in the Indian context regarding risk factors for adverse pregnancy out- comes in women with GDM as well as prediction tools incorporating various risk factors. The aim of the study was to identify the risk factors associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with GDM.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecol- ogy of a tertiary care institute in South India. Data on women with GDM were merged from previous studies conducted from Jan 2017 to December 2023. 2401 women>18 years of age with singleton foetus and diagnosed as GDM with 75gram oral glucose tolerance test using IADPSG criteria were included. Women with Type 1 / 2 Diabetes Mellitus and long-term steroid use were excluded. Details of the risk factors, including demographic characteristics, clinical features, and maternal and perinatal outcomes, were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with Stat V17. Baseline characteristics were summa- rized as propositions or means. A stepwise backward logistic regression analysis was done to identify the association of risk factors with com- posite adverse pregnancy outcomes, and the strength of the association was reported as an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval. Adjusted OR (aOR) was calculated after adjusting for potential con- founders. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
Baseline characteristics included mean maternal age of 27 years, Majority (78.7%) belonging to lower middle class of socioeco- nomic staus ,96% had a spontaneous conception, 11% of the population had PCOS,13% had prior GDM history,18% family history of diabetes mellitus,mean weight gain during pregnancy was 9 kgs, mean gesta- tional age of diagnosis of GDM was 27 weeks and 64.5% of the popu- lation were GDMA1. Significant predictors of perinatal adverse com- posite events included early-onset GDM (GDM;< 24 weeks gestation aOR 0.58, 95% CI:0.43-0.79,p=0.001), PCOS (aOR 1.71, 95% CI:1.23 - 2.37, p=0.001), family history of diabetes (aOR 3.65, 95%CI:2.80- 4.76, p=0.001), gestational hypertension (aOR 1.86,95%CI:1.27-2.71, p=0.001), preeclampsia (aOR 3.91,95%CI:2.64-5.81, p=0.001),higher pre pregnancy BMI (aOR 0.97, 95%CI:0.94 - 1.00, p=0.034) and lower gestational age at delivery (aOR 0.84, 95%CI:0.80 - 0.87, p=0.001 ).

**Conclusion:**
PCOS, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, fam- ily history of diabetes were associated with increased odds whereas early onset GDM, Higher pre-pregnancy BMI, earlier gestational age at delivery were associated with decreased odds of adverse perinatal outcome.

**Background and aims:**
There is a lack of outcome data relating to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in midlife women with type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly concerning cardiovascular risk, gynae- cological and oestrogen-related cancers.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed an active comparator new user design, retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX platform, a global federated database of electronic health records. We preformed three analyses relating to regulator approved HRT dosing. Cohort 1: Impact of T2D in users of HRT with transdermal oestrogen. Cohort 2: Impact of transdermal HRT versus non-users in individuals with T2D. Cohort 3: Impact of oral versus transdermal HRT in individu- als with T2D. Cohort 1 was 1:1 propensity score matched (PSM) for age and ethnicity. Cohorts 2 & 3 were PSM for age, ethnicity, HbA1c, BMI and history of essential hypertension (SSMD <0.1). Outcomes of interest were pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cerebral infarc- tion, and breast, ovarian and endometrial carcinoma. Analysis began from the index event, defined as initiation of HRT or a statin for controls. Individuals were followed up for 5 years post index event and time to event analysis was conducted on-treatment.

**Results:**
Study population (n = 7600, Cohort 1: n = 2650; Cohort 2: n = 2298; Cohort 3: n= 2652). Follow up ranged from 1523±568 to 1713±332 days. Mean ages ranged from 58.3 ± 9.9 to 59.0 ± 10.8 years. There was a significant selection bias to white women across all cohorts consistent with all menopause research (75% White, 17% Black, 2% Asian). Cohort 1: Compared to HRT users without T2D, transdermal HRT in women with T2D was associated with a greater risk of PE (HR 2.70, 95% CI 1.14-6.42, p=0.019), DVT (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13-3.33, p=0.014), IHD (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.74-2.60, p<0.001) and cerebral infarction (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.17-3.03, p=0.008), but no differences in rates of breast, ovarian or endometrial carcinoma. Cohort 2: For individuals with T2D, use of transdermal HRT, compared to non-users, was associated with a reduced risk of IHD (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-0.99, p=0.047), and no difference in risk of PE, DVT, cerebral infarction, breast, ovarian or endometrial carcinoma. Cohort 3: Oral, compared with transdermal HRT in individuals with T2D, was associated with an increased risk of IHD (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.08-1.66, p=0.008) and cerebral infarc- tion (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.07-2.39, p=0.022), but no difference in risk of: PE, DVT, breast, ovarian or endometrial carcinoma.

**Conclusion:**
Midlife women with T2D using HRT have a greater risk of PE, IHD and ischaemic stroke compared to users of HRT without T2D. Our data suggests that transdermal HRT use in T2D is associated with no additional PE/DVT/IHD/ischaemic stroke risk compared to non-HRT users with T2D. Women with T2D using HRT do not have increased risks of breast or gynaecological cancers com- pared to HRT users without T2D, but we did not match for type of HRT (combined versus oestrogen only). Up to five years of regulator approved doses of transdermal HRT appears safe in a large cohort of midlife women with T2D. Given increased risks with oral HRT, we propose that women with T2D should not be prescribed oral oestrogen therapy.

8. Greece, Garibaldi Hospital, Catania, Italy, University of Bari, Bari,

**Background and aims:**
The individual risk of developing diabetes- related complications (DRC) is extremely variable in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and an overlap between macro (MVC) and microvascular (μVC) complications exists. We developed a score to measure the overall bur- den of DRC including 3 main MVC (coronary, lower limbs, cerebro- vascular) and 4 main μVC (eye, nerves, kidney, foot).

**Materials and methods:**
This multicenter retrospective study evalu- ated T2D patients who regularly attended 4 different diabetes clinics (≥3 visits in the previous 3 years) in Italy or Greece. Data on MVC and μVC were retrieved from the electronic medical records, and scored either 0, 1 or 3 if absent, subclinical (instrumentally detected) or overt (clinically manifest), respectively.

**Results:**
1,302 subjects (age 69±13 years, 37% women, disease dura- tion 14±16 years) were included in the final analysis. Among them, 1,170 (90%) subjects had DRC score≥1; as compared with patients with DRC score <1, they were older (70±12 vs 62±15.5 years, p<0.0001) and with longer disease (8±12 vs 4±8 years, p<0.0001). Subclini- cal MVC and μVC occurred in 831 (64%) and 980 (75%) patients, while overt disease was present in 390 (30%) and 473 (36%) patients, respectively. The presence of overt μVC increased the likelihood to have overt MVC (OR 2.5 [2.0-3.2], p<0.0001). The median DRC score was 3±5 points, being higher in men (p<0.0001), increasing with age (r2=0.06, p<0.0001) and with diabetes duration (r2 0.14, p<0.0001), with an intercept of -17 years. The individual ratio of DRC score and disease duration was used to calculate susceptibility to DRC, and the 2 extreme quintiles of this distribution identified subjects extremely resistant (DRC score=0.04+0.3/10yrs) and extremely susceptible to DRC (DRC score=6.11+2/10yrs).

**Conclusion:**
We demonstrated a strong relationship between MVC and μVC in T2D, which is only partially explained by diabetes duration. DRCs may develop long before a diabetes diagnosis and progress at varying rates in each patient, highlighting the need for further inves- tigation into susceptibility and resistance factors. The proposed algo- rithm provides a reliable tool for assessing individual susceptibility to DRCs, which can be easily integrated into clinical practice.

5. versity of Buckingham, Buckingham, UK, Research and Training

**Background and aims:**
Obesity is a chronic, relapsing condition associated with over 230 medical complications and reduced life expectancy. Despite advances in pharmacotherapy and policy efforts, the global prevalence continues to rise. In the UK, 26.1% of adults are obese, with higher rates in socioeconomically deprived regions. This study uses a localised model to assess the direct and indirect costs of obesity, applying national datasets, validated Frontier Eco- nomics assumptions, and a NICE-aligned cost-of-illness framework.

**Materials and methods:**
We applied a systems-level economic model to estimate obesity-related costs in a UK region of 678,825 individuals aged 16+, integrating local data by age, sex, depriva- tion, ethnicity, income, and national economic inputs. Direct costs included GP consultations, outpatient and inpatient care, prescrip- tions, and obesity-related complications (ORCs). Indirect costs were calculated from productivity losses from unemployment, inactivity, early retirement, and sick leave. Social care (formal and informal) was estimated using per-capita cost multipliers. QALY losses were valued at £20,000 each, following UK Treasury guidance. Life-years lost were estimated from global cohort data.

**Results:**
In the selected population, 144,556 adults (21.3%) were living with obesity. The annual economic burden of obesity was £501.7 million, comprising £82.0M in NHS care (576,185 outpatient visits, 51,910 elective and 56,926 emergency admissions), £152.8M in social care (£76.2M in under-65 informal care; £70.1M in over-65 informal care; £6.6M in formal care), £144.0M in productivity losses (£111.4M due to unemployment/inactivity; £32.6M from 292,384 obesity-related sick days), and £122.9M from 6,144 QALYs lost. The average annual NHS cost per person ranged from £438 (BMI 30-34) to £1,114 (BMI ≥40). High-risk ethnic minorities with BMI ≥27.5 were included in prevalence estimation as per NHS guidance. ORCs amplified costs with Hypertension (39.3%), Type 2 Diabetes (22.8%), and Osteoarthritis (16.1%) being the most common and contribut- ing to 73% of the £30.5M complication costs. Nearly 75% of people with obesity had at least one ORC, and 28% had three or more. Life expectancy analysis indicated a reduction of 2-10 years, depending on BMI class, in line with international cohort data.

**Conclusion:**
This model quantifies obesity’s broad economic and clinical impact at a localised system level. Beyond healthcare costs, obesity drives burdens in social care, productivity, and QALY loss. Global trends show similar cost patterns and inequities, particularly among ethnic minorities and low-income groups, reinforcing the need for urgent adoption of scalable, person-centred chronic disease frameworks and investment in early intervention.

6. (MUMC+), Maastricht, Netherlands, Internal Medicine, Radboud

**Background and aims:**
Arterial stiffness (AS) has been associated with insulin resistance (IR), yet few to no studies have related AS to IR in specific tissues. Also, knowledge on associations of AS with incident diabetes is limited. Therefore, we evaluated associations of AS with IR in liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and with incident diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
In 7277 participants (59.8±8.7 years, 23.0% type 2 diabetes), oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed to generate hepatic insulin resistance index (HIRI), muscle insulin sensitivity index (MISI), adipocyte insulin resistance index (ATIRI) for tissue-specific IR, and Matsuda index for whole-body IR. AS was measured as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Linear regression was used for cross-sectional associations of cfPWV with IR. Logistic regression was performed for associations with incident OGTT-detected impaired glucose metabolism (based on impaired fast- ing and/or 2hr glucose, available in n=1324), and Cox regression for associations with self-reported incident diabetes (available in n=4380). Potential confounders included demographics, physical activity, diet, body mass index, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure.

**Results:**
In the adjusted models, cfPWV was inversely associated with Matsuda index (standardized β: -0.07 [95% CI -0.11; -0.02]), but not with tissue-specific IR (HIRI: 0.04 [-0.01; 0.09], MISI: -0.03 [-0.08; 0.03] or ATIRI: 0.03 [-0.02; 0.08]). In follow-up analyses, cfPWV was associated with incident impaired glucose metabolism (standard- ized odds ratio = 1.20 [1.00; 1.43], 10 yrs follow-up, 227 cases, fully adjusted). CfPWV was not significantly associated with self-reported new-onset diabetes (standardized hazard ratio: 1.03 [0.86; 1.24], 9 yrs follow-up, 179 cases, fully adjusted).

**Conclusion:**
In this middle-aged population, AS was related to whole- body IR and incident impaired glucose metabolism, but not signifi- cantly to tissue-specific IR or new-onset diabetes. To further explore the association with incident impaired glucose metabolism, we plan to evaluate the potential relationship between AS and beta cell function.

**Background and aims:**
Overtreatment for diabetes is a major condi- tion associated with health-related adverse outcomes. The aims of this study were to assess the rate of glycemic overtreatment and explore the association with sarcopenia among multimorbid older diabetic patients.

**Materials and methods:**
A cross-sectional study was conducted at the centre hospital on diabetic patients aged 60 years or above having multi-comorbid and HbA1c ≤ 8.5% (69.4mmol/mol). Multi-comorbid was defined as having Charlson comorbidities index CCI ≥ 3 points. Glycemic overtreatment was defined as having an HbA1c < 6.5% (53 mmol/mol). Sarcopenia and low lean mass were diagnosed using the Asia Working Group on Sarcopenia - AWGS criteria. Glycemic low- ering medications, severe hypoglycemia, diabetic chronic complica- tions were recruited from medical records. Age, living status, cogni- tive impairment (using Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE ≤ 23 points), depressive symptoms (using Geriatric Depression Scale - 15, GDS ≥ 5 points), history of falls in the last 12 months, dependences (using Activities Daily Living - ADL < 6 points) and frailty (using Edmonton Frail Scale - EFS ≥ 7 points) were evaluated in the study. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between glycemic overtreatment and sarcopenia and low lean mass.

**Results:**
A total of 657 multimorbid diabetic older patients were recruited in the study (mean age 74.1 (7.4) years old, 65.0% female, 37.9% sarcopenia). The rate of overtreatment was 39.2%, of those the rate of severe hypoglycemia was 2.8%. Among glycemic overtreated patients, metformin (64.0%) was the most frequently described glucose- lowering medication (GLM), and using insulin (12.0%) and gliclazide MR (30.2%) were not significantly associated with increase odd ratio of severe hypoglycemia (2.9% and 2.1%, respectively). In univariable logistic regression, glycemic overtreatment was associated with higher risk of having sarcopenia and low muscle mass. After adjusted for age, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, history of falls, depend- ences and frailty, the association between glycemic overtreatment and having sarcopenia (aOR 1.47, 95%CI 1.04 - 2.10) and low muscle mass (aOR 1.43, 95% 1.01 - 2.04) were still remained.

**Conclusion:**
Glycemic overtreatment was common and related with higher odds ratio for sarcopenia and low lean mass in multimorbid dia- betic older patients. Further longitudinal study is necessary to empha- size this casual relationship.

**Background and aims:**
Individuals with diabetes have an increased fracture risk that is not fully explained by bone mineral density (BMD) derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is often normal or even elevated in this population. While DXA remains the gold standard for osteoporosis diagnosis, it does not capture diabetes- related alterations in bone microarchitecture, that increases fracture risk, such as increased cortical porosity (primarily in type 2 diabetes) and altered trabecular structure (primarily in type 1 diabetes). High- resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) provides deeper insights into bone microstructure. However, its limited accessibility hinders widespread clinical adoption. Therefore, this study aims to develop a regression model to predict the HR-pQCT-derived failure ultimate load test (FULT), offering a more comprehensive assessment of bone fragility using DXA-derived features.

**Materials and methods:**
Data was obtained from the GERICO cohort, a population-based study conducted in Geneva between 2008 and 2018, with data collected at three-year intervals across three visits. The pre- sent study focused on a subsample of 229 insulin-resistant participants, defined as having known diabetes or a HOMA value ≥2.5, who con- tributed with 687 paired DXA and HR-pQCT scans. Several regression models were evaluated, including single and multiple linear regression, random forest regression, and extreme gradient boosting regression. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets (60/20/20), with exclusivity of subjects maintained across splits by ensuring that all data from a subject’s visits were contained within a single split.

**Results:**
The random forest regressor achieved the highest R² of 0.84 on the validation set and was selected for final evaluation. Key predic- tive features included the minimum lean mass in the arms, bone min- eral content (BMC) in the arms and legs, and the minimum BMD in the legs, where the lowest recorded value from either the left or right limb was used to ensure that the weakest measured site was considered in the analysis. The model achieved an R² of 0.81 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 635.15 on the independent test set (Figure). Finally, a 5-fold cross-validation performed on the entire dataset demonstrated strong performance, with a mean R² of 0.79 (95% CI: [0.72, 0.86]).

**Conclusion:**
These findings suggest that a DXA-based model can reli- ably predict FULT, potentially aiding in the identification of individuals with diabetes at increased risk of fragility fractures. Future research should explore whether specific measures, such as trabecular area and cortical porosity, can be predicted with similar precision, further improving fracture risk assessment in individuals with diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Periodontitis share a known disease association with hyperglycemia induced chronic low grade inflammation predisposing to Periodontitis progression. Emerg- ing evidences suggest an interplay between long non-coding RNA NEAT1 and microRNA-146a (miR-146a) which dysregulates the inflammatory milieu contributing to various diabetic complications like Diabetic Foot Ulcer. But its role in T2D related periodontal complica- tion is yet to be established. Therefore, this study explores the primary role of NEAT1/miR-146a axis in Diabetes-Periodontitis pathogenesis.

**Materials and methods:**
Forty-five T2D subjects with (D+P+; N=25) and without (D+P-; N= 20) periodontitis underwent periodontal evalu- ation which included measurement of Probing Pocket Depth (PPD) and Clinical Attachment Loss (CAL), followed by Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) collection. Plasma and GCF levels of miR-146a, as well as PBMC and GCF expressions of NEAT1, and PBMC expressions of TRAF6 and NF-κB were quantified using Real-Time PCR. GCF and serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 were measured using ELISA. Data were compared to 20 healthy controls.

**Results:**
Plasma and GCF miR-146a levels were significantly reduced in the D+P+ group (p<0.05) compared to controls, while both PBMC and GCF NEAT1 expression levels were markedly elevated (p<0.05), establishing a negative correlation between miR-146a and NEAT1 (r = -0.63, p<0.0001). PBMCs from D+P+ subjects exhibited significant increased expression of TRAF6 and NF-κB, along with elevated serum and GCF levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6.. Plasma miR-146a levels were negatively correlated with HOMA-IR (r = -0.6, p<0.005), TRAF6 (r = -0.62, p<0.005) and NF-κB (r = -0.55, p=0.009). Notably, plasma and GCF miR-146a levels were also negatively correlated with PPD (r = -0.6, p=0.01; r = -0.66, p=0.02) and CAL (r = -0.57, p=0.04; r = -0.48, p=0.34), while GCF NEAT1 exhibited positive correlation with PPD (r= 0.77 , p=0.01), CAL (r=0.68 , p= 0.04).

**Conclusion:**
This study indicates that the NEAT-1/miR-146a axis may potentiates inflammatory signaling, contributing to periodontal tissue degradation in the context of metabolic dysregulation and also suggesting its potential therapeutic role in T2D-periodontitis comor- bidity. Further studies in larger population are needed to validate these exploratory findings.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin resistance (IR) plays a critical role in cardiovascular mortality, particularly in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the link between organ-specific IR (skeletal muscle, adi- pose tissue, liver) and cardiac alterations and mortality risk, inde- pendent of established cardiometabolic risk factors, is unclear. This study examines whether tissue-specific IR associates with cardiac abnormalities and predicts long-term survival, after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, HbA1c, T2D status, coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF) at baseline.

**Materials and methods:**
Individuals with (n=850) and without T2D (n=2,243) from the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) cohort underwent echocardiography and coronary angi- ography due to suspected acute coronary syndrome. IR was quanti- fied for whole body using HOMA2-IR, adipose tissue (Adipo-IR; fasting non-esterified fatty acids*C-peptide), and liver (HIR; 0.45 + 0.23*log(insulin) 0.24*(AUC​ insulin) - 0.24*log(adiponectin)). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, HbA1c, and T2D diagnosis. Telephone interviews and population registries recorded mortality over a median follow-up of 15[IQR: 9-18] years. Cox regression models additionally accounted for CAD and HF.

**Results:**
Individuals (median age 63[56-70] years, 30% female) were predominantly overweight (BMI 27[25-30] kg/m², HbA1c 6.0[5.6-6.4] %). Individuals with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and those reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) exhibited 8% and 11% higher HOMA2-IR and 17% and 16% higher Adipo-IR (both p<0.001), respectively, as compared to individuals without HF. HIR was slightly higher in both HF groups (+1%, p<0.05). Adipo-IR was 4% higher in HFpEF than in HFrEF (p<0.05). HOMA2-IR was positively associ- ated with a 9% higher mortality (p<0.01), which was attenuated after adjusting for CAD and HbA1c. In contrast, higher Adipo-IR was inde- pendently related to 18-% and 13-% greater mortality risk, even after adjusting for CAD and HF (p<0.001). HIR was not significantly associ- ated with mortality. No significant interaction was observed between CAD or HF status and IR indices on mortality risk.

**Conclusion:**
Adipose-tissue insulin resistance is an independent pre- dictor of mortality in individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease. These findings highlight the potential value of incorporating Adipo- IR into clinical risk assessment for personalized cardiovascular risk stratification.

**Joint association of skeletal muscle mass and grip strength with the progression of carotid plaque score in patients with type 2 diabetes**

J. Shin

**Background and aims:**
Not only low appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), but also low grip strength (GS) are associated with the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, respectively. This study inves- tigated the longitudinal joint association of ASM and GS with the pro- gression of carotid plaque score (PS) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Of 1,525 patients who were initially involved, one thousand sixty-one subjects (mean age = 62.2 ± 9.7 years) com- pleted studies for assessment of carotid PS at baseline and a median fol- low-up of 5.1 years (IQR 4.4 - 5.6). The progression of PS was defined as an increase more than 1 point in PS at follow-up than at baseline (range: 0 - 12). ASM and GS were measured at baseline. Participants were classified into four groups based on the sex-specific median values of ASM/BMI and GS: high ASM/high GS (HASM/HGS), low ASM/ high GS (LASM/HGS), high ASM/low GS (HASM/LGS), and low ASM/low GS (LASM/LGS).

**Results:**
Patient with the progression of PS were 469 (44.2%) and were more likely to be old and male. They had higher waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), serum creatinine, PS at baseline, but lower diastolic BP (DBP), HDL cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), ASM/BMI, and GS compared with those without the progression of PS. Subjects in the LASM/LGS group were older and had higher SBP, WC, C-reactive protein (CRP), PS at baseline, but lower DBP and eGFR than those in the HASM/HGS group. After adjusting for age, sex, current smoker, BMI, WC, SBP, DBP, CRP, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, and eGFR, the odds ratios and 95% con- fidence intervals for the progression of PS were 3.28 (2.12 - 5.09, < 0.001) in the LASM/HGS group,2.31 (1.49 - 3.58, < 0.001) in the HASM/LGS group, and 7.38 (5.02 - 10.85, < 0.001) in the LASM/ LGS group, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Patients having both low ASM and low GS were more strongly associated with the progression of carotid PS compared with those having both high ASM and high GS and low ASM or low GS alone, independent of multiple potential risk factors. These results propose that measuring both ASM and GS may be more helpful in detecting the progression of atherosclerosis than each alone in patients with type 2 diabetes.

**EZH2-driven epigenetic regulation in foam cell formation: implica- tions for diabetes-induced atherosclerosis**

M. Aziz, K. ­Sourris, K. Jandeleit-Dahm, A. ­Khan

1. Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, German Diabetes Centre,

**Background and aims:**
Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven chronic inflammatory disease. It is characterized by plaque build-up in arter- ies leading to cardiovascular complications. Atherosclerosis develop- ment is significantly accelerated in diabetes. Macrophages are immune cell population that upon uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) transform into foam cells. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of epigenetic mechanisms in modulating macrophage functions. Studies have shown deficiency of Enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) results in reduced foam cell formation. However, the role of EZH2 in foam cell formation in diabetes-associated atherosclerosis is not known.

**Materials and methods:**
In an model, THP-1 derived mac- rophages were stimulated with ox-LDL+High glucose (HG) for 24hrs to induce foam cell formation in the presence and absence of a spe- cific EZH2 inhibitor, GSK126. Genetic shRNA-mediated knockdown of EZH2 was also performed in THP-1 monocytes. EZH2 mediated H3K27me3 and foam cell formation was assessed in an study using an atheroprone diabetic mouse model. experiments were performed where bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from myeloid-specific EZH2 knockout (KO) and wild-type mice were cul- tured using HG + ox-LDL conditions.

**Results:**
Foam cell formation was significantly attenuated with GSK- 126 in ox-LDL+HG stimulated THP-1 cells as assessed by ORO stain- ing. Protein analysis confirmed EZH2 knockdown in THP-1 mono- cytes, which also showed reduced foam cell formation in oxLDL and HG-stimulated cells. In the study, plaque and foam cell forma- tion were significantly reduced in diabetic mice treated with GSK-126. In our experiments, BMDMs from EZH2 KO mice exhibited a marked reduction in ox-LDL uptake under HG conditions.

**Conclusion:**
Our study identified that inhibiting EZH2 with GSK-126 is an important strategy to inhibit diabetes-associated atherosclerosis due to its impact on foam cell formation.

2. versity Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan, Department of
3. School of Medicine, Gifu, Japan, Department of Clinical Nutrition,

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes is increasingly prevalent worldwide and often accompanied by sarcopenia, particularly in older adults. Although insulin resistance is recognized as a major contributor to diabetic muscle loss, the role of glucose signaling in skeletal muscle atrophy remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the patho- physiological role of the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), a glucose-sensing transcription factor encoded by the gene in mice, in diabetic sarcopenia by deleting the gene in insulin-deficient, hyperglycemic mice.

**Materials and methods:**
We examined 12-weeks- old , , ; and ; mice for muscle strength, endurance, survival, body com- position. Skeletal muscles were harvested for histological feature and gene expression analysis of anabolic and catabolic markers.

**Results:**
mice showed similar hyperglycemia as mice (773±21.1 mg/dL vs. 724±26.6 mg/dL, mean±SEM, p=0.21), but exhibited marked reductions in body weight (17.3±0.44 g vs 23.7±0.46 g, p<0.01), grip strength (0.19±0.01 kg vs 0.24±0.01, p<0.01) and increased mortality (p < 0.01, at 20 weeks) compared with mice. deletion in mice led to marked reductions in the lower limb skeletal muscle mass, especially gastroc- nemius muscle (0.08±0.01 g vs 0.11±0.003 g) (p<0.01) as well as tibialis anterior, soleus and quadriceps.Immunohistochemical analysis of tibialis anterior muscle fibers revealed a significant decrease in mean fiber size in mice, with a higher proportion of smaller fib- ers compared to other groups. Type 2B and 2A fibers in mice exhibited the smallest cross-sectional areas, although their area and number percentages remained comparable across groups. In the tibialis anterior muscle, deficiency in mice suppressed compensatory and expression while upregu- lating the atrophy marker . These changes were not observed in and ; mice alone.

**Conclusion:**
deletion exacerbates skeletal muscle atrophy and frailty in mice, indicating a crucial role for ChREBP- mediated glucose signaling in maintaining muscle mass under diabetic conditions. The ; model may serve as a novel tool to study diabetic sarcopenia and identify therapeutic targets beyond insulin signaling.

**Glucose deprivation impairs lipid tolerance related to mitophagy disorder in cardiomyocytes**

L. Huang

**Background and aims:**
Severe hypoglycemia is associated with adverse cardiac outcomes in diabetic patients, yet its underlying mech- anisms remain unclear. Our prior study demonstrated that the myo- cardium of diabetic mice characterized by hyperglycemia and hyper- lipidemia, exhibited heightened vulnerability to severe hypoglycemia compared to non-diabetic mice. This study investigates the effects and mechanisms of glucose deprivation on cardiomyocytes following com- bined high glucose and lipid pretreatment.

**Materials and methods:**
H9C2 cardiomyocytes were pretreated with high glucose (33 mM) and palmitic acid (100 μM) to simulate diabetic metabolic conditions, followed by glucose deprivation. Cell viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial function including reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produc- tion, and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy were evaluated using CCK-8 assay, Hoechst staining, Western blot, MitoTracker staining, and immunofluorescence. The mitophagy activator urolithin A (UA) was used to validate the role of mitophagy. Statistical analyses included one-way ANOVA with LSD post hoc tests (homogeneous variance) or Kruskal-Wallis H test (non-homogeneous variance). Experiments were independently repeated at least three times.

**Results:**
Cardiomyocytes initially displayed robust viability and enhanced PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy after short-term high glucose and lipid exposure. However, in the matched intervention time, glucose deprivation following combined high glucose and lipid pre- treatment (but not high glucose alone) significantly increased cellular injury. This was characterized by reduced viability ( < 0.001), elevated apoptosis ( < 0.01), and mitochondrial dysfunction, including struc- tural disruption, elevated ROS, depolarization ( < 0.01), diminished ATP production ( < 0.001), and impaired PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy ( < 0.01). These adverse effects were mitigated by UA treatment ( < 0.05).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings highlight glucose as a critical regulator of lipid tolerance via mitophagy in cardiomyocytes. This mechanism may underlie myocardial injury during severe hypoglycemia in diabetes, offering insights into therapeutic strategies.

**Incident sepsis in people with or without type 2 diabetes: the Fre- mantle Diabetes Study Phase II**

W.A. Davis

**Background and aims:**
Sepsis (life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection) has high mortality (>10%) and is a leading cause of death worldwide. People living with type 2 diabetes have a 2- to 6-fold increased risk of sepsis and worse associated morbidity and mortality compared to people without diabe- tes but contemporary data are limited. This study aims to i) determine the incidence of sepsis in a community-dwelling cohort of people with type 2 diabetes compared with matched people without diabetes, and ii) explore associates of incident sepsis.

**Materials and methods:**
The Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II is a longitudinal observational study conducted in an urban community of 157,000 people. We followed 1,430 participants with confirmed type 2 diabetes and 5,720 de-identified age-, sex- and postcode-matched people without diabetes from entry (2008-2011; or the equivalent date for each matched individual without diabetes) to first record of incident sepsis in the Western Australian Hospital Morbidity Data Collection or Death Register, onset of diabetes (for the matched cohort, defined as first hospitalisation for/with diabetes) or death or end-2021, whichever came first. Ten-year age-specific and overall incident rates (IRs) for sepsis in the type 2 diabetes cohort were compared with those for the no diabetes cohort, and IR ratios (IRRs) calculated. Cox regression was used to generate HRs for incident sepsis. Since the cohort without diabetes was de-identified, only age, sex, prior sepsis and comorbidi- ties were available for multivariable analyses. Exploratory analysis of baseline variables associated with incident sepsis in the type 2 diabetes cohort was also performed.

**Results:**
The combined cohorts had mean age 66 years and 52% were male. At entry, 2.0% of those with type 2 diabetes had a prior hospitali- sation for/with sepsis vs 0.8% of their matched counterparts ( <0.001). During 73,139 person-years of follow-up, 169 (11.8%) participants with type 2 diabetes and 288 (5.0%) people without diabetes had inci- dent sepsis ( <0.001). In the Figure, IRs (left panel: type 2 diabe- tes, no diabetes) and IRRs (right panel) by age groups and overall are shown, with a U-shaped relationship evident for the 10-year age- specific IRs only for those with type 2 diabetes. The overall IRR was 2.38 (95% CI: 1.96, 2.89). After adjustment, type 2 diabetes remained significantly associated with double the risk of incident sepsis (HR (95% CI: 2.16 (1.78, 2.62)). For the type 2 diabetes cohort, age, male sex, Aboriginal ancestry, current smoking, insulin use, fasting serum glucose, heart rate, distal symmetrical polyneuropathy, cerebrovascular disease, and ­log NT-proBNP were significantly associated with inci- dent sepsis.

**Conclusion:**
People living with type 2 diabetes experience double the risk of incident sepsis, but the disparity is more marked in those ≤60 years. Modifiable risk factors include smoking and hyperglycaemia, but prevention of chronic complications and comorbidities is also imperative.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 (T1D) and 2 diabetes (T2D) have been linked to decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether (i) insulin resistance and reduced insulin clearance are linked to pulmonary dysfunction in T1D, T2D and normal glucose tolerance (CON) in the German Diabetes Study (GDS) and to test if (ii) there is a possible causal association between insulin resistance and pulmonary dysfunction performing a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis in an GDS-independent cohort.

**Materials and methods:**
The study analyzed spirometry data of 339 T1D, 408 T2D, and 188 CON participants from the GDS. Participants underwent in-depth metabolic phenotyping including Botnia clamps to measure insulin sensitivity (M-value) and clearance. Generalized linear models were fitted to analyze the association between insulin resistance and clearance and spirometry measures, adjusting for major confound- ers, such as age, sex, BMI, HbA1c, fasting glucose, inflammatory bio- markers, smoking, and pulmonary comorbidities. Summary statistics from genome wide association studies (GWAS) were employed to per- form the 2-sample MR analysis with HOMA-IR (MAGIC Consortium, n=37,037) and pulmonary function parameters (UK Household Longi- tudinal Study, n=321,047) as instrumental variables.

**Results:**
Across the whole GDS cohort, M-value and insulin clearance were associated with FEV1 (β=0.19 and β=0.18; both <0.001) and FVC (β=0.07, =0.006 and β=0.08, =0.012). In persons with T2D, FEV1 and FVC were lower than in those with T1D and CON and were associated with M-value (β=0.18, =0.01 and β=0.18, =0.036). In participants with T1D, FEV1 was negatively associated with daily insu- lin doses (β=-0.22, <0.001). MR analysis with GWAS data suggests a causal association between HOMA-IR and FEV1 (β=-0.13, =0.002).

**Conclusion:**
Improved pulmonary function is associated positively with whole-body insulin sensitivity and insulin clearance. Insulin resistance may be linked to restrictive pulmonary impairment, high- lighting insulin sensitivity as a target to preserve pulmonary health.

**Background and aims:**
As pharmacological treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are becoming more effective in achieving larger weight loss, the need to better understand aspects of muscle health is growing. Loss of muscle mass commonly co-occurs with weight reduction: To understand if this response is adaptive, it is important to describe rate of wasting with ageing during a timespan relevant for clinical trials. The aim of this study was to provide ref- erence values for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based muscle composition describing changes with ageing in people with T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
n=3760 UK Biobank participants were scanned twice approximately 2 years apart using a 6-minute MRI protocol. Images were analyzed for fat-free muscle volume (MV) and muscle fat infiltration (MFI) of the thighs and spinal erectors using AMRA® Researcher, Linköping, Sweden. For each participant, a sex-, weight- and height invariant thigh MV z-score was calculated. Mus- cle composition changes were described in participants with T2D and compared to sex, age, and BMI matched controls (1:2). Differences between baseline and 2 years T2D and matched controls were tested using paired t-tests. Differences in change T2D to matched controls were tested using regression models adjusted for baseline value of the response variable and weight change.

**Results:**
n=153 participants had T2D (34% women, mean [SD] age 64.7 [7.1] years, BMI 29.0 [4.9] kg/m , diabetes duration 9.0 [6.6] years). After 2 years, they had a modest and non-significant weight reduction (Table 1) with concurrent loss of MV (both thighs and spi- nal erectors) and increase in MFI (both thighs and spinal erectors). Compared to matched controls, loss of thigh MV (both absolute and z-score) was significantly larger in T2D - a similar non-significant trend was observed for spinal erectors MV. Increases in thigh MFI were somewhat larger (but non-significant) in T2D compared to matched controls. Results were similar for women and men.

**Conclusion:**
People with T2D experienced faster muscle wasting with ageing as compared to sex-, age-, and BMI matched controls in the UK Biobank imaging study. The results indicate that some metabolic disor- ders may be associated with more rapid muscle wasting. The vulnera- bility of these individuals is important to consider in drug development, especially in the context of large and significant weight reductions.

**Background and aims:**
Older patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are increasing in Japan. Patients with T2D are prone to developing both malnutrition and sarcopenia. This study aimed to investigate the impact of malnutrition and sarcopenia on mortality risk in older patients with T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
Older patients with T2D were followed pro- spectively. Malnutrition was assessed using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and was defined as a GNRI of less than 98. Sar- copenia was defined as the presence of both muscle mass loss and muscle weakness based on AWGS 2019 criteria. Based on the presence of malnutrition and sarcopenia, participants were classified into four groups (Group 1, malnutrition/sarcopenia (-/-); Group 2 (+/-); Group 3 (-/+) and Group 4 (+/+)). Mortality risk was analyzed using Cox pro- portional hazards models and pairwise comparisons among the groups.

**Results:**
The median follow-up period was 86 months. Of the 396 participants with 232 men, 71.3 (6.3) years, and 23.6 (3.7) kg/m , 306 were in Group 1, 32 in Group 2, 36 in Group 3, and 22 in Group 4. During the follow-up period, 31 participants died, with malignant tumors being the leading cause of death in 15 cases. Compared to the group 1, the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval, p value) of group 2, 3, and 4 were 7.71 (2.60-22.9, <0.001), 3.86 (1.29-11.6, 0.016) and 13.1 (34.97-34.6, <0.001), respectively, after adjusting for covariates. Furthermore, the result of pairwise cox proportional hazards models for groups showed that the mortality risk of group 4 was statistically significant compared to group 3, while that of group 4 was not statistically significant compared to group 2 (Table).

**Conclusion:**
This study clarified that the presence of both malnutri- tion and sarcopenia was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality in older patients with T2D. The results of the stratified analysis indicate that the mortality risk is significantly higher with malnutrition among sarcopenia; thus, more attention to nutritional status is needed for older patients with T2D.

**Vascular stiffness is an independent risk factor for bone micro- architectural deterioration in type 2 diabetes patients: a cross- sectional study**

X. Chen

**Background and aims:**
Increasing research demonstrates that tra- becular bone score (TBS), superior to bone mineral density (BMD), is pivotal in assessing bone microarchitecture and predicting fracture risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, the factors influencing bone microarchitecture in patients with T2DM remain unidentified. Further, The bone-vascular axis is often disrupted in metabolic diseases, which is poorly studied within the context of T2DM. This study aimed to investigate the influencing factors of bone microarchitecture and the relationship between vascular stiff- ness and bone microarchitecture in patients with T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
This study comprised 492 participants with T2DM. L1-L4 TBS was assessed via dual-energy X-ray bone densitometry (DAX) and categorized into three groups: normal bone microarchitecture, partially degraded bone microarchitecture, and degraded, using 1.23 and 1.31 as cut-off criteria. The differences among groups in the independent variables were analyzed. Independ- ent risk factors influencing bone microarchitecture in T2DM patients were examined by stepwise linear regression across several gender subgroups. The correlation between L1-L4 TBS and baPWV was further examined based on this premise.

**Results:**
Among the 492 patients, 180 (36.6%) exhibited partial or severe deterioration of bone microarchitecture. The degraded microarchitecture group exhibited significantly elevated levels of age, SBP, BUN, ALP, N-t OC, TPINP, and baPWV, alongside com- paratively diminished levels of BMI, Hb, FN BMD, TH BMD, L1-L4 BMD. And age (P<0.001), BMI (P=0.001), TPINP (P=0.005), ALP (P=0.025), baPWV (P<0.001) were independent risk factors associ- ated with L1-L4 TBS. Among them, baPWV showed significance across various gender groupings. After adjusting for relevant con- founding variables, baPWV exhibited an independent and negative association with L1-L4 TBS (β = -0.021, 95% CI: -0.032, -0.010). Furthermore, baPWV showed the highest predictive value for bone microarchitectural degeneration in females, with an AUC of 0.742 (95% CI= 0.662-0.822, P<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
baPWV, as an independent risk factor for TBS, is negative correlated with the severity of the degradation of bone microarchi- tecture, indicating a relationship between vascular stiffness and the degradation of bone microarchitecture.

2. wich, London, UK, Centre of Social Care, Health, and Related
3. Research, Birmingham City University, Birmingham, UK, South

**Background and aims:**
Most research studies conducted to examine the acute and chronic conditions in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have focused on hyperglycaemia, microvascular and macrovascular complications. Furthermore, there is a significant knowledge gap and limited studies that have evaluated the effect of T2D on bone quality and skeletal fragility. Previous reviews have tended to focus primarily on bone mineral density (BMD) as a measure of bone quality. How- ever, BMD does not fully reflect the risk of fracture, cannot distinguish between cortical and trabecular bone, and bone fragility in patients with T2D results not only from alterations in bone mineralisation, but also due to changes in bone microarchitecture. Therefore, assessment tools such as trabecular bone score (TBS) and trabecular microarchitec- tural parameters could be useful and practical tools for examining bone status in people with T2D. This review aims to examine the effect of type 2 diabetes on bone quality based on a variety of assessment tools.

**Materials and methods:**
This systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out in line with The Preferred Reporting Items for Sys- tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and relied on PICOS framework. Searches were carried out by two researchers in the following data- bases: Academic Search Premier, APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE, Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection databases from database inception until 24/02/25. The reference list of articles and Google Scholar were also searched for relevant studies. The meta-analysis of data was conducted using The Review Manager 5.4.1 software.

**Results:**
Ten studies were included in the systematic review, while nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Based on the narra- tive synthesis and meta-analysis, four distinct themes were established; Bone mineral density, TBS and trabecular microarchitectural param- eters, fracture risk and body mass index (BMI). The meta-analysis of the effect of T2D on BMD showed that T2D significantly (P<0.05) increased lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and narrow neck BMD compared with controls. The Mean Differences (MD) for the respec- tive parameters were 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03, 0.05, p<0.0001); 0.05 (95% CI, 0.02, 0.08, P=0.002); 0.07 (95% CI, 0.04, 0.10, P<0.0001); 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01, 0.05, P=0.0005). While there was significant reduction (P<0.0001) in the patients with T2D group with respect to volumet- ric BMD, T2D did not appear to have significant effect (P>0.05) on total BMD and area BMD compared to control. In relation to TBS and trabecular microarchitectural parameters, the effect of T2D was not significant (P>0.05) compared with control. Furthermore, T2D did not have significant effect (P>0.05) on the incidence of hip fracture and non-spine fracture compared to control. Following meta-analysis, it was found that the T2D group significantly (P<0.05) increased BMI compared to control with a MD of 0.94 (95% CI,0.74, 1.14, P<0.0001).

**Conclusion:**
Type 2 diabetes significantly increased (P<0.05) lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, narrow neck BMD and BMI compared with control. However, type 2 diabetes did not appear to have signifi- cant effect (P>0.05) on TBS, trabecular microarchitectural parameters, and the incidence of hip and non-spine fracture.

**The association of haptoglobin levels and phenotype with cardi- ovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes: a FIELD trial sub-study**

**Background and aims:**
Haptoglobin (HP) is a circulating glycopro- tein with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It scavenges toxic free haemoglobin. Haptoglobin (HP) 2-2 phenotype has been suggested as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to modulate fenofibrate benefit on CVD risk in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, little is known as to whether HP levels modulate CVD risk and fenofibrate response.

**Materials and methods:**
HP phenotype was determined in baseline plasma from 8047 T2D adults in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial by ELISA. HP levels were meas- ured at both baseline and time of randomisation (after 6-week active fenofibrate run-in) by immunoturbidimetric assay. The association of HP phenotype and levels with new on-trial total CVD events (a com- posite endpoint including coronary heart disease events, total stroke, and other cardiovascular death events plus coronary and carotid revas- cularisation) over five years was assessed.

**Results:**
Frequencies of HP 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2 phenotypes were 15.6%, 47.6% and 36.9% respectively. Higher baseline HP levels, but not HP phenotype, were associated with total CVD events in the placebo group (n = 4030, hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.31 [1.02-1.67] for HP level tertile 3 vs tertile 1, P = 0.033). This was driven by participants with HP 1-1 phenotype (P for interaction = 0.014, Figure 1A). Participants with the lowest baseline HP level tertile and HP 1-1 phenotype tended to have the lowest CVD risk (Figure 1B), whereas CVD risk was similar in other participants, regardless of HP phenotype and levels. Fenofibrate benefit on total CVD events did not differ significantly by HP pheno- types, baseline HP level tertiles, or tertiles of change in HP levels by fenofibrate during active run-in.

**Conclusion:**
Baseline HP level was an independent predictor of CVD risk. A lower CVD risk is found only in T2D participants with both HP 1-1 phenotype and low baseline HP levels. Fenofibrate benefits on CVD risk reduction did not differ by baseline HP level or phenotype.

**Background and aims:**
Arterial stiffness may contribute to organ damage via potential reduced local metabolism, possibly resulted from microvascular damage in local tissues. The pancreas and in particular the islets and the beta cells therein are exposed to high blood flow and may, therefore, also be affected by arterial stiffness. However, few to no studies have related arterial stiffness to beta cell dysfunction.

**Materials and methods:**
In 2932 participants (59.9±8.2 years, 28.0% type 2 diabetes (T2D), oversampled with T2D participants by design), oral glucose tolerance tests were performed to generate beta cell function (BCF) measurements including C-peptidogenic index , overall insulin secretion index, beta cell glucose sensitivity, beta cell potentiation factor and beta cell rate sensitivity. An overall BCF score was calculated as the average of the five standardized BCF measure- ments followed by re-standardization. Arterial stiffness was measured as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). BCF measurements and cfPWV were ln-transformed and standardized. Linear regression was used to assess the cross-sectional associations between cfPWV and BCF indices. Potential confounders included demographics, physical activity, diet, body mass index, insulin resistance, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure.

**Results:**
In the fully adjusted models, cfPWV was inversely associ- ated with overall BCF score (standardized β: -0.19 [95% CI -0.23; -0.14]). In line, cfPWV was inversely associated with C-peptidogenic index (-0.06 [-0.11; -0.01]), overall insulin secretion index (-0.06 [-0.11; -0.01]), beta cell glucose sensitivity (-0.06 [-0.11; 0.00]), beta cell potentiation factor (-0.12 [-.017; -0.07]), and with beta cell rate sensitivity (-0.04 [-0.09; 0.02]).

**Conclusion:**
In this middle-aged population, arterial stiffness, meas- ured as cfPWV, was consistently associated with worse beta cell func- tion. Thus, an increase in arterial stiffening may contribute to impaired (regulation of) synthesis and secretion of insulin and further to the risk of developing T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Adults with Type-1 Diabetes (T1D) have poor bone mass, as well as bone quality, as compared to the non- diabetic population, translating into increased fracture risk. There is conflicting data on various bone health parameters, especially bone quality, in children and adolescents with T1D. The study aimed to assess variations in bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS), as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), in underprivileged Indian children and adolescents with T1D compared to age- and gender-matched controls.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 250 children, 150 with T1D and 100 age- and gender-matched controls, were included in the pre- sent cross-sectional comparison study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. BMD at the lumbar spine was assessed by DXA (Lunar iDXA, GE Healthcare), and the TBS was assessed using the iNsight software (version 2.2.0.0, Medimaps). The data was analysed using DataTab software. Shapiro-Wilk’s test was performed on all con- tinuous variables to determine the normality of distribution. Further analysis was done using the Unpaired-t test in normally distributed data, and the Mann Whitney test for data that violated the criteria of Equality of Variance. Pearson Correlation was used for correla- tional analysis.

**Results:**
The mean age in the T1D group was 13.6±2.3 years (controls 13.2±2.2 years, =0.079), with 42% males (controls 47.5%, =0.199). The median HbA1c in the T1D group was 8.7% (5.8% to 12.9%), and the median duration of diabetes was 5.5 years (1.1 to 15 years). The areal BMD at the lumbar spine (LSBMD, 0.851±0.17 vs 0.889±0.16, =0.038) and the corresponding Z-scores (-1.276±1.118 vs -0.906±1.027, =0.004) were signifi- cantly lower in the T1D group as compared to controls. The spine TBS was significantly lower in children with T1D (1.310±0.097 vs 1.350±0.086, <0.001). In the diabetes group, there was a high positive correlation between the LSBMD and the TBS (r=0.67, <0.001), while HbA1c, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum phosphorous negatively correlated with the TBS (r=- 0.22, =0.008; r=-0.29, =0.001; and r=-0.29, <0.001, respec- tively). There was no significant correlation between duration of dia- betes, serum calcium, or serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D and the TBS. The LSBMD demonstrated a significant negative correlation with ALP (r=-0.54, <0.001) and serum phosphorous (r=-0.4, <0.001), but no correlation with the other parameters. A significant correla- tion was seen between the TBS and the LSBMD (r=0.59, <0.001), the TBS and ALP (r=-0.38, <0.001), the TBS and phosphorous (r=-0.28, =0.002), the LSBMD and ALP (r=-0.51, <0.001), and the LSBMD and phosphorous (r=-0.4, <0.001) in the control group as well.

**Conclusion:**
Adolescents and children with T1D have worse trabecular bone mass as measured by lumbar spine bone mineral density, as well as worse bone microarchitecture as measured by TBS, more so with poorer glycemic control. This altered bone quantity and quality early in the course of diabetes, preventing optimal peak bone mass, could be a major determinant of increased fracture risk seen in T1D individuals.

**Background and aims:**
Hyperandrogenic disorders, including the pol- ycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may be common in women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) due to iatrogenic systemic hyperinsulinism. We aimed to describe the prevalence of PCOS and its phenotypes using state-of- the-art methodology in a cohort of premenopausal women with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Cross-sectional study. We recruited con- secutively 149 women aged 18 to 45 years diagnosed with T1D attending the diabetes clinics in an academic referral hospital in Madrid, Spain. The diagnosis of PCOS and its phenotypes was per- formed following international recommendations. Liquid chroma- tography-tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC-MS/MS) were used for androgen measurement. Besides, we compared women with T1D and PCOS with age-matched women with PCOS and abnormal glu- cose tolerance (n=45) or normoglycemia (n=250) who belonged to a historical cohort of PCOS from our center.

**Results:**
Hyperandrogenic disorders (considering PCOS, idiopathic hyperandrogenism and idiopathic hirsutism as a whole) were present in 39 women with T1D (26%, 95%CI: 20-34%). Thirty out of 149 women with T1D fulfilled PCOS diagnostic criteria, corresponding to a prevalence of 20% (95%CI: 15-27%). The most common PCOS phenotype was the classic combination of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction. The agreement between calculated and equi- librium dialysis free testosterone was moderate (Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.68-0.80). Women with T1D and PCOS were younger (mean age 25 ± 7 31 ± 9 year-old, = 0·003) and their onset of T1D was more frequently premenarcheal (73% vs 46%, = 0·008) compared to those without PCOS. Com- pared to 295 regular patients with PCOS, the 30 women with T1D and PCOS showed milder hyperandrogenic signs and lower free tes- tosterone concentrations [0.38 (0.26, 0.72) vs. 0.61 (0.43, 0.84) ng/ dl, < 0·001], regardless of the glucose tolerance of the former.

**Conclusion:**
PCOS is present in one of every five women with T1D, with the classic combination of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction being its more common phenotype. Routine screening for this prevalent disorder seems reasonable to avoid the negative consequences of androgen excess and chronic ovulatory dysfunction on the general and reproductive health of T1D women.

3. UK, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Vascular complications are the leading cause of morbidity in people with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) with significant reductions in life expectancy compared to non-diabetic peers. Our objective was to evaluate potential relationships between ethnicity and/or socio-economic status (SES) and vascular complica- tions in young people with T1D from a regional cohort.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective case notes review of all patients aged 12-30 years old with T1D for ≥3 years ­(1 April 2021 - ­31 March 2024), in two large diabetes centres in the West Midlands. Extracted data included demographics, blood pressure, retinopathy screening results, urine albumin-creatinine ratio, and type of insulin regimen.

**Results:**
422 patients met the eligibility criteria (205M: 217F). 215 (51%) were from the most deprived Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile (Q1) and 211 (50%) were from non-white ethnicities. Median duration of diabetes was 10.4 years (IQR 7.1, 15.3) HbA1c rose with each year of diagnosis with a sharp peak at around 23 years of age. There was no association of HbA1c with ethnicity. SES had a significant effect with those from IMD Q1 having an HbA1c of 66mmol/mol vs IMD Q5 59mmol/mol.The most common compli- cation was diabetic retinopathy (18% of cohort). The probability of any complication was associated with lower SES, higher HbA1c and duration of diabetes. Ethnicity showed no significant effect.

**Conclusion:**
In this ethnically diverse and highly deprived cohort, the primary factor influencing glucose control and complication rate was socio-economic status with no influence of ethnicity, unlike in older adult cohorts

**Background and aims:**
Hypoglycaemia induces an inflammatory response, characterized by increases in leukocytes, possibly due to its effect on the marginal pool and mediated by the adrenaline response. Whether hypoglycaemia also affects erythropoiesis and the potential role of adrenaline is not known, but may be relevant in the context of cardiovascular complications. We therefore studied the effect of both hypoglycaemia and of adrenaline infusion leading to a concen- tration seen during hypoglycaemia on erythropoiesis in people with or without type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
Data are derived from two studies. In the first, 25 adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 16 without diabetes (No-D) underwent a 60-min hyperinsulinaemic- hypoglycaemic (2.75±0.01 mmoL/L) clamp. Blood was drawn before hypogly- caemia, at hypoglycaemia, and seven days later. In the second study, 15 adults with T1D and 15 WD were given adrenaline intra- venously at 0.04 μg/kg/min for 1 hour. Blood was drawn at base- line, after 60 minutes, and seven days thereafter. In both studies, red blood cells (RBCs) and reticulocytes counts were measured using flowcytometry (Sysmex XN-450). Serial data were analyzed with mixed model analysis. The data are shown as mean±SE. As there were no significant differences between the two groups in neither study and reported both groups together unless specified otherwise.

**Results:**
In study 1, adrenaline levels during hypoglycaemia aver- aged 1.35±0.15 and 1.92±0.38 nmol/L in T1D and WD, respec- tively (P=0.12), whereas in study 2, these were 2.12±0.31 nmol/L and 2.24±0.28 nmol/L, respectively (P=1.0). In response to hypoglycaemia, neither RBCs nor reticulocytes changed acutely at 60 minutes. However, reticulocytes, but not RBCs, increased from 0.056±0.003*1012/L to 0.074±0.003*1012/L at 7 days (P<0.001). The same trend was seen when reticulocytes were displayed as fraction of RBCs (from 1.15±0.06% to 1.55±0.07%, P<0.001). In response to adrenaline, RBCs rose at 60 minutes from 4,32±0.12*1012/L to 4.70±0.12*1012/L (P<0.001), which remained elevated at day 7 at 4.75±0.09*1012/L (P<0.001). Similarly, reticu- locytes rose from 0.045±0.002*1012/L to 0.053±0.003*1012/L (P<0.001), remaining elevated at day 7 at 0.057±0.003*1012/L (P<0.001). Reticulocytes as a fraction of RBCs rose from 1.05±0.05% to 1.11±0.06% (P<0.001) and also remained elevated at day 7 at 1.20±0.06% (P=0.002).

**Conclusion:**
Hypoglycaemia has a sustained stimulating effect on erythropoiesis in people with or without type 1 diabetes, which seems largely mediated by adrenaline. Further research is needed to assess the impact of this effect on clinical outcomes.

**Highs, lows and inflammatory flows: the link between glycaemic variability and inflammation in diabetes**

1. Department of Internal Medicine, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, Nether-
2. lands, Division of Human Nutrition and Health, Wageningen Uni-
3. versity, Wageningen, Netherlands, Department of Internal Medicine,

**Background and aims:**
Glycaemic variability (GV) has been associ- ated to the progression of complications in both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the underlying mechanism is not completely clear. We hypothesize that inflammation may be a mediating factor. The aim of this study is to determine the associations between GV and inflammation, and whether these differ between T1D and T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a post-hoc analysis from the Hypo- METRICS study, involving 166 participants with T1D and 184 partici- pants with insulin-treated T2D, who wore a CGM for 10 weeks. Mean glucose, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV) and glycaemic variability percentage (GVP) were calculated from the CGM data. Circulating inflammatory proteins were measured using Olink Proteomics AB inflammation panel and compared between groups with high or low GV in both T1D and T2D. Whole blood flow cytometry was performed to determine the number of circulating immune cells (total white blood cells, neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes) in a subset of 31 T1D and 88 T2D participants. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were also deter- mined as these have been associated to the progression of complica- tions in diabetes. Spearman correlations were used for the associations with the different GV metrics.

**Results:**
All GV metrics were higher in T1D compared to T2D ( <0.001). SD was 2.8 [2.3-3.3] mmol/L in T1D and 2.4 [1.9-2.9] mmol/L in T2D, CV was 32 [28-36] % in T1D and 26 [23-30] % in T2D, and GVP was 23 [18-28] % in T1D and 17 [13-21] % in T2D. Only mean glucose was comparable between both types (T1D: 8.7 [7.9-9.9] mmol/L, T2D: 8.7 [7.7-10] mmol/L). Several inflamma- tory proteins were higher in participants with high GV compared to low GV, but the proteins differed between T1D and T2D (e.g. TRANCE and IL-4 were higher in participants with T1D and high GV, and EN-RAGE and IL-5 in those with T2D and high GV). In T1D, mean glucose was correlated with the number of circulating neutrophils ­(r =0.43, =0.017), NLR ­(r =0.49, =0.006) and MLR ­(r =0.47, =0.007), SD was correlated with NLR ­(r =0.51, =0.004) and MLR ­(r =0.38, =0.035), and GVP was correlated with NLR ­(r =0.50, =0.005). Conversely, both CV ­(r =-0.36, =0.047) and GVP ­(r =-0.42, =0.017) were inversely correlated with the number of circulating lymphocytes in T1D. In T2D, there were no such cor- relations, except that GVP was inversely correlated with the number of circulating lymphocytes ­(r =-0.25, =0.021).

**Conclusion:**
GV is associated with circulating inflammatory protein levels and white blood cells, both in T1D and T2D. This association seems more pronounced in T1D, possibly because of the more pro- found GV in T1D. Based on these results, the link between GV and inflammation deserves further exploration.

**Background and aims:**
Hypoglycaemia induces an acute and sus- tained inflammatory response in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and adults without diabetes (WD). Factors driving this inflammatory response remain unknown, but there is a correlation with the adrena- line response. Therefore, we investigated the response of circulating white blood cells and inflammatory markers to adrenaline infusion, leading to a concentration seen during hypoglycaemia, in adults with T1D and WD.

**Materials and methods:**
In total 15 adults with T1D and 15 matched WD, received adrenaline intravenously at 0.04 μg/kg/min for 1 hour. Blood was drawn at baseline, at 30 and 60 minutes, and 180 min- utes, 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after adrenaline infusion to determine white blood cell count and circulating inflammatory markers. Immune cell composition of whole blood was measured using flowcytometry (Sysmex XN-450) and 92 circulating inflammatory proteins were meas- ured in plasma using the Olink Proteomics AB Inflammation Panel. Serial leukocyte data were analysed with a mixed model analysis, with the data shown as mean±SE. Serial inflammatory proteins data were analysed with Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests with significance reported as FDR (false discovery rate) corrected for multiple testing.

**Results:**
Plasma adrenaline levels peaked to 2.37±0.28 and 2.23±0.25 nmol/L, adults with T1D and WD respectively (p=NS). Adrenaline elicited an acute increase in monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes with no differences between the two groups. Here, we report data for both groups unless specified otherwise. Monocytes peaked after 30 minutes, rising from 0.44±0.03*109/L to 0.73±0.05*109/L, p<0.001 normalizing after 1 day 0.39±0.03*109/L, p=NS compared to baseline. Lymphocytes peaked after 30 minutes, rising from 1.53 ±0.10*109/L to 3.12 ±0.23*109/L, p<0.001, and remained elevated after 7 days at 1.88 ±0.14*109/L p<0.001. Neutrophils peaked after 180 minutes, ris- ing from 2.72±0.21*109/L to 4.69 ±0.27*109/L, p<0.001 normalizing after 1 day 2.88±0.21*109/L, p=NS compared to baseline. Adrenaline also elicited an increase in several inflammatory proteins in adults with T1D, but not in WD, for example uPA, TNFRF9, Flt3L, CCL25 were significantly elevated 3 days after adrenaline administration, with uPA and Fit3L remaining elevated after 7 days.

**Conclusion:**
Administration of adrenaline elicits an acute inflam- matory response at both the cellular and protein level in adults with T1D and WD, that is partly sustained for up to 7 days, particularly in the T1D group. These findings suggest that adrenaline mediates a considerable part of the pro-inflammatory response observed during hypoglycaemia.

2. cine and Diabetes Care, Matsuyama, Japan, Cardiovascular Medicine,

**Background and aims:**
Although continuous glucose monitoring systems provide large amounts of information compared with hemo- globin A1c (HbA1c) or glycated albumin (GA), their use is ineffective. The use of continuous wavelet transform (cWT), machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data may offer solutions to numer- ous problems in this setting. The aim of this study was to investigate whether complex glucose data may predict adverse coronary events by a combination with cWT and machine learning with a neural network.

**Materials and methods:**
Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (n=74) were compared with controls (n=73), including patients with diabetes. Data obtained from a flash glucose monitoring system over 3 days at the same timepoint (including 15-min intervals) were averaged. Next, the data were converted to bird’s-eye images with a contour diagram through a cWT process (figure). To assess the features of each peak, each image was divided into 19 segments according to the cWT logic. To identify the characteristics of the bird’s-eye image belonging to the ACS group, 130 randomized data were learned by AI. In each box, the surface area, gravity, full width at half maximum towards frequency and time, top position of the peak as morphology and minimum or median value of the scalogram from statistics were nominated as explanatory variables. HbA1c, GA and the mean ampli- tude of glycemic excursions were also included. Explanatory variables (n=177) were evaluated by an ensemble model based on three different hyperparameters produced from a machine learning algorithm with a neural network. The results were verified using 16 not learned data selected from both groups.

**Results:**
One control case was excluded from the learning process because the patient developed ACS 3 months later. AI produced hyper- parameters from one hidden layer with 177 neurons. The ensemble model (root mean squared error: 0.27; correlation coefficient: 0.85) demonstrated an accuracy of 0.94 and an area under the curve on the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94. The score of the patient who converted from control to ACS was 0.99, denoting an ACS pattern. A casual blood glucose was the strongest contributing factor to the AI decision (1.54%), followed by GA (−1.25%). HbA1c weakly contrib- uted to the decision (0.68%). The mean amplitude of glycemic excur- sions did not. The minimum value of the peak position of the scalogram on C11 was 1.18%. AI identified 22 gravity, 18 peak position, 10 full width at half maximum, and three surface areas, in addition to 8 median and minimum values of the scalogram on each area. This information was largely distributed in the lower frequency zone.

**Conclusion:**
The converted continuous glucose shift through cWT was able to detect the onset of ACS using machine learning based on AI. The cWT of continuous glucose monitoring may be a powerful predic- tor of coronary artery incidents.

**Papez circuit and glymphatic system involvement in type 2 diabetes patients: abnormal effective connectivity patterns and enlarged choroid plexus volume**

Y. Zhang

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recog- nized as a condition linked to cognitive decline, yet the neural under- lying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study explored the potential interplay between altered effective connectivity (EC) in the Papez circuit, regional structural degeneration, and glymphatic dys- function as contributory mechanisms to cognitive deficits in T2DM.

**Materials and methods:**
Totally, 80 T2DM patients and 75 healthy con- trols (HCs) underwent multimodal MRI. Resting-state fMRI data were analyzed using spectral dynamic causal modeling (spDCM) to quantify EC between Papez circuit regions: hippocampus (HPC), mammillary body (MB), anterior thalamic nucleus (AT), anterior and posterior cin- gulate cortex (ACC and PCC), entorhinal cortex (ERC), and subiculum (SUB). Structural 3D-T1 images were processed to measure regional vol- umes and choroid plexus volume (CPV), a proxy for glymphatic activity. Participants underwent standardized cognitive assessments to evaluate neurocognitive function. Group differences in mean connectivity strength were assessed using independent samples -tests. Bivariate correlations (Pearson/Spearman) evaluated associations among altered EC, structural volumes, clinical measures, and cognitive performance. A mediation model tested the CPV as the mediator between left HPC volume (inde- pendent variable) and HPC MB connectivity (dependent variable).

**Results:**
The T2DM patients exhibited significant EC reductions in three Papez circuit pathways: HPC MB (p=0.001), AT ACC (p=0.005), and ERC HPC (p<0.001). Structural atrophy was observed in the left HPC (p=0.001) and left thalamic (p=0.006), accompanied by CPV enlargement (p =0.027). Notably, the effect of the left HPC volume on the EC of HPC MB was partially medi- ated by the CPV, with a significant indirect effect of 0.1264 (95% CI: 0.0089, 0.2437). The CFT-delay score was positively correlated with the reduced EC from the HPC MB (r= 0.468, p <0.001), the AT ACC (r= 0.356, p =0.001) and the left HPC volume (r= 0.331, p=0.003); nevertheless, a negative correlation between the CFT- delay score and the choroid plexus volume (r=-0.344, p =0.002). Furthermore, BMI was negatively correlated with decreased left hippocampal volume and reduced EC from the MB ACC. Fur- thermore, reduced EC from both the HPC MB and the AT ACC exhibited a negative correlation with C-peptide levels.

**Conclusion:**
Our study highlights the complex interplay between functional disruptions, structural atrophy, and glymphatic dysfunction within the Papez circuit in T2DM-related cognitive decline. These findings offer potential biomarkers for early detection of cognitive impairments and novel therapeutic targets for intervention in T2DM.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) significantly increases the risk of dementia. Frailty, a state of multisystem decline linked to aging and chronic disease, is increasingly recognized as a critical complication of T2DM. This study aimed to investigate the association between physical frailty, neuroimaging biomarkers, prot- eomic profiles, and vascular dementia (VaD) in patients with T2DM using data from the UK Biobank.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 10,976 T2DM patients (aged 56.18±8.09 years, 36.81% male) without baseline dementia were included. Frailty was assessed by five indicators: weight loss, exhaus- tion, weakness, physical inactivity, and slow walking speed, catego- rizing participants into non-frailty, pre-frailty, and frailty groups. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the association between frailty status, proteomic markers, and VaD incidence, adjust- ing for demographic variables, disease duration, biomarkers (HbA1c, glucose, CRP), genetic risk scores, and comorbidities (hypertension, stroke, depression). Brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) in a subset (n=126) identified frailty-associated neuroanatomical changes using linear regression. Spearman correlation analyses confirmed brain regions associated with cognitive questionnaires.

**Results:**
Among participants, frailty prevalence was 20.84% (n=2,287), pre-frailty was 58.61% (n=6,433), and non-frailty was 20.55% (n=2,256). Frail individuals had higher BMI, CRP, and comorbidities (p<0.001). From March 2006 to October 2022, 243 T2DM patients developed VaD. Compared with non-frail individuals, frail partici- pants showed significantly higher risk (HR=1.91, 95% CI: 1.29-2.83, p<0.01) in fully adjusted models. Subgroup analyses showed elevated VaD risk in frail patients without depression (HR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.28- 3.03, p<0.01), without stroke (HR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.28-2.91, p<0.01), and with hypertension (HR=2.23, 95% CI: 1.45-3.43, p<0.001). Fur- ther analyses identified significant proteomic biomarkers linked to VaD risk in frail T2DM patients, including FETUB, a metabolic regulator showing protective effects (HR=0.42, 95% CI: 0.18-0.96, LogFC=6.97, adjusted p=0.02), and PENK, a neuropeptide precursor associated with increased risk (HR=2.85, 95% CI: 1.14-7.12, LogFC=4.90, adjusted p<0.001). In neuroimaging studies, frail T2DM patients exhibited reduced gray matter volume in cognition-associated brain regions, such as left superior temporal gyrus (β=-0.43, adjusted p=0.02, r=-0.23, p=0.02) and left middle occipital gyrus (β=-0.46, adjusted p=0.01, r=-0.21, p=0.03), correlating with memory and executive function decline.

**Conclusion:**
Physical frailty significantly elevates VaD risk in T2DM patients. Neuroimaging and proteomic biomarkers provide additional insights into underlying mechanisms, emphasizing the importance of early frailty identification and biomarker-targeted interventions to delay or prevent dementia.

**Olfactory training improves cognitive function in type 2 diabetes patients with mild cognitive impairment: a 16-week randomised controlled trial**

Y. Bi

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) significantly elevates risks of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Olfactory dys- function, more prevalent in T2D patients and predictive of accelerated cognitive decline, may serve as a modifiable intervention target. Olfac- tory training (OT) has shown promise to enhance cognition, yet its efficacy in T2D patients with MCI remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether OT mitigates cognitive decline in this population.

**Materials and methods:**
In this 16-week, open-label RCT, 60 T2D patients with MCI (age 40-75 years, stable glucose-lowering regimen) were randomly assigned (1:1) to OT or control. The OT group per- formed twice-daily 6-min standardized exposure to six odorants (rose, eucalyptus, lemon, clove, coffee, cinnamon) for 16 weeks, with adher- ence monitored remotely. Controls received routine care. ​The primary outcome was the change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. Secondary outcomes included: 1) other neuropsychological assessments (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE], domain-spe- cific tests), 2) computerized olfactory testing, 3) structural MRI and odor-induced task-based fMRI, and 4) metabolic parameters. ANCOVA and Gaussian random field (GRF) correction were used for statistical analyses.

**Results:**
OT significantly improved the primary outcome: global cogni- tion measured by MoCA (Δ+1.8 ± 1.3 vs. Δ+0.2 ± 1.8, p = 0.001). Secondary outcomes showed enhanced ​global cognition (MMSE: Δ+0.8 ± 1.1 vs. Δ-0.3 ± 1.2, p = 0.001), and domain-specific cogni- tion gains in visuospatial ability (Δ+6.6 ± 12.2 vs. Δ-2.7 ± 9.3, p = 0.026), executive function (Stroop time Δ-8.2 ± 14.7 vs. Δ+0.4 ± 14.7 s, p = 0.039), and delayed memory (Δ+7.7 ± 15.4 vs. Δ-0.7 ± 9.6, p = 0.048). OT also increased olfactory total score (Δ+2.3 ± 5.4 vs. Δ-3.9 ± 11.2, p = 0.030). Brain MRI revealed concurrent struc- tural and functional changes: volumetric increases in memory-related regions (left amygdala [Δ+94.2 ± 127.4 vs. Δ-12.4 ± 136.3 mm³, p = 0.014] and hippocampal CA3 subfield [Δ+5.0 ± 8.0 vs. Δ−1.9 ± 10.1 mm³, p = 0.011]), alongside ​prefrontal hypoactivation (Δ-0.6 ± 3.0 vs. Δ+1.5 ± 3.7, p = 0.001). No significant between-group differ- ences were observed in metabolic parameters. Moderated mediation analysis indicated a relationship where prefrontal hypoactivation medi- ated global cognitive improvement (MMSE), with mediation strength moderated by olfactory threshold gains (index = 0.113, 95% CI: 0.012- 0.255; interaction p = 0.004).

**Conclusion:**
This RCT demonstrates that 16-week olfactory training improves global and domain-specific cognition in T2D patients with MCI, accompanied by olfactory and neuroimaging enhancements. These findings support OT as a home-based cognitive preservation strategy.

**Lung function and risk of incident dementia in type 2 diabetes: a population-based cohort study**

Y. Sun

**Background and aims:**
Dementia has emerged as an important comorbidity of diabetes, often accompanied by a decline in physical function including a poor lung function. However, the association between lung function and dementia risk in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal relationship between lung function impairment and risk of dementia among patients with T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included 16,025 (mean age 59.8 years; 61.2% male) participants with T2D and free of baseline dementia from the UK Biobank. Obstructive physiology (OP) and restrictive physiology (RP) were defined using spirometry, includ- ing forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capac- ity (FVC). The study outcomes were new-onset dementia and two major component endpoints, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD). Cox proportional hazards models were used to esti- mate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

**Results:**
During a median 12.8 years of follow-up (204,717 person- years), 778 participants (4.9%) developed dementia, which consisted of 283 AD (1.8%), and 221 VD (1.4%) cases. In multivariable- adjusted models (including sociodemographic, lifestyles, and cardio- metabolic factors), per 1-standard deviation (SD) decrease in FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEV1% predicted, and FVC% predicted were associated with a 21%, 20%, 7%, 15%, and 13% increased risk of incident dementia, respectively. Specifically, per 1-SD decrease in FVC significant associated with an increased risk of AD (HR, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.02-1.43), while per 1-SD decrease in FEV1 (HR, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.00-1.42), FEV /FVC (HR, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.02-1.28), and FEV1% predicted were associated with higher risk of VD. Compari- son to patients with preserved lung function, those with OP exhibited a dementia HR of 1.18 (95% CI: 0.92-1.53), whereas the RP group had a significantly higher risk (HR, 95% CI: 1.39, 1.15-1.68). Strati- fied analysis revealed that the associations of FEV1 and FVC with risk of incident dementia were strengthen for women, and lower FEV1 showed higher risk of dementia among those more than 60 years and lower FVC presented higher risk of VD among diabetic patients with BMI ≥25 kg/m (all p for interaction <0.05). Although APOE-ε4 genotype did not modify overall associations (p for inter- action >0.05), ε4 carriers with the lowest tertile in FEV1 (HR, 95% CI: 1.37, 1.02-1.84) or FVC (HR, 95% CI: 1.40, 1.04-1.88) had the highest risk of dementia compared to the ε4 noncarriers with optimal lung function.

**Conclusion:**
In this prospective cohort of individuals with T2D, impaired lung function was independently associated with higher risks of dementia. These finding highlights the potential of lung function assessment to identify high-risk individuals with diabetes, enabling early preventive measures and interventions.

6. Paris, France, Lariboisiere Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.

**Background and aims:**
Persons with type 1 diabetes are at greater risk of poor cognitive function than those without, contributing fac- tors include younger age at disease onset, longer diabetes duration, and the presence of complications. Given the independent associations between inflammation and cognitive dysfunction in other contexts, we hypothesize that circulating inflammatory markers can be sensitive subclinical biological indicators of cognitive function in persons with type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
We used data from the REVADIAB study, which investigates glycemic variability, cognitive and vascular com- plications of type 1 diabetes. Among 50 participants who underwent cognitive evaluation using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS®-4), 23 had comprehensive peripheral blood immunopheno- typing. Participants were classified into two groups based on a median standardized IQ score of 121 ­(IQ and ­IQ ). Immune cell counts, cytometry-derived immune cell frequencies, and expression levels of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor IRF5 were analysed.

**Results:**
Median age was 39 years (IQR=29-56), with 39% female, a mean BMI of 24.9 kg/m², mean HbA1c of 7.85% (SD=1.02), and mean diabetes duration of 23.8 years (SD=9.76). No significant differences were found between ­IQ and ­IQ groups in terms of age, gender, BMI, or diabetes-related variables. Lower monocyte counts were near- significantly associated with high performance ­(IQ ; p=0.08). A lower frequency of non-classical monocytes was significantly asso- ciated with high performance ­(IQ ; p=0.006). High performance ­(IQ ) was also associated with increased IRF5 expression in Innate Natural Killer cells (p=0.01), myeloid dendritic cells (p=0.01), total monocytes (p=0.01), and monocyte subsets (classical p=0.01; inter- mediate p=0.01; non-classical p=0.03) (Table 1). Simple and multiple binary logistic regression models for high performance ­(IQ ) and component indices revealed that for every percent increase in non- classical monocyte frequency, the associated odds of a high working memory index was decreased (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.4-1, p=0,05), this remained significant after adjustment for immunological variables (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22-0.98, p=0.04).

**Conclusion:**
These findings indicate that circulating immune markers may reflect cognitive function, and subclinical variation. In particular, monocyte and monocyte subtype frequencies may be valuable indica- tors of cognitive performance, namely working memory, in persons living with type 1 diabetes.

**Risk factors of cognitive impairment caused by type 2 diabetes and brain resting-state fMRI study**

H. Liu

**Background and aims:**
To explore the related influencing factors of cognitive impairment caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and Cranial resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs- fMRI)to assess whether differences in functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and the whole brain are associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), this provides new ideas for diagnosis and treatment for early detection and delay of cognitive dysfunction in T2DM patients.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 160 T2DM patients were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ask about the history of hypoglycemia,the duration of T2DM, smoking history, hypertension history, diabetic complications, drinking history, etc. All subjects were assessed by a professional physician on the Mon- treal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), and patients were divided into two groups according to the scores: There were 80 patients in the type 2 diabetes mild cognitive impairment group (T2DM-MCI group) (<26 points) and 80 patients in the type 2 diabetes non-cogni- tive impairment group (T2DM-NCI group)(≥26 points). In addition, the clinical indicators of all subjects were collected at the same time: fasting and postprandial blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, blood lipids, thyroid function, and six inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL -10, TNF-α), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, thyroglobulin (TG), liver function, kidney function, glycosylated hemoglobin and Urine microalbumin/creatinine (U-ALB/Cr) and other clinical blood and urine test indicators.Rs-fMRI data preprocessing was based on the MATLAB platform, and DPARSF software was used for statistical analysis. The posterior cingulate cortex was used as the seed point, and two-sample t-test was used to compare the differences in func- tional connectivity of whole brain regions between the T2DM-MCI group and the T2DM-NCI group.

**Results:**
The mild cognitive impairment group and the non-cogni- tive impairment group were significantly different in education time (Z=-10.951, =0.000), insulin growth factor-binding protein-3 (Z=- 2.624, =0.009), The ratio of insulin-like growth factor-1 to insulin- like growth factor-binding protein-3 (Z=-2.114, =0.035) was statis- tically different. Further multivariate analysis showed that education time was an independent risk factor for MCI in T2DM (OR value was 0.767, 95%CI was 0.684-0.860, =0.000). For patients with type 2 dia- betes, increasing education time may be a protective factor for cogni- tive impairment. The functional connectivity of the posterior cingulate (PCC) to the parietal, inferior parietal, frontal, precentral and postcen- tral gyrus was decreased in the T2DM-MCI group compared with the T2DM-NCI group. In addition, enhanced functional connectivity with the right temporal lobe, basal ganglia, uncinate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, occipital lobe, and cuneiform lobe.

**Conclusion:**
Less education time is an independent risk factor for MCI in T2DM. It indicates that prolonging education time and improving educational level may prevent or delay MCI in T2DM patients. T2DM patients with lower insulin growth factor binding protein-3 are more likely to develop MCI. Abnormal functional connectivity between PCC and multiple brain regions in T2DM patients with MCI, which may provide a direct neuroimaging marker and a new direction for diagnosis and treatment for early detection of cognitive impairment in T2DM patients.

**Comparative analysis of hearing loss between diabetic and non- diabetic populations**

W. Tan

**Background and aims:**
To explore the difference of hearing loss between diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 849 diabetic patients who were hospitalized from September 2022 to December 2023 were included. They underwent hearing testing and completed continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) blood glucose monitoring for ≥5 days or fingertips blood glucose monitoring 7 times a day for ≥5 days. At the same time, 849 non-diabetic outpatients were enrolled as the non-diabetic group. Measurement data with normal distribution or approximately normal distribution were expressed as (±s); Measure- ment data with non-normal distribution were expressed as M (P25, P75). Count data represented by use case (%). Categorical variables were compared by test, and continuous variables were compared by independent sample t test or rank sum test. test was used to analyze the number and incidence of hearing loss in non-diabetic patients of different ages. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
The incidence of hearing loss in the diabetes group was higher than that in the non-diabetes group. The incidence of hearing loss in the diabetes group was 72.8%, and the incidence of hearing loss in the non-diabetes group was 49.0%, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P<0.05). All non-diabetic patients were divided by age according to the latest World Health Organiza- tion standard, and it was found that the incidence of hearing loss in non-diabetic patients increased gradually with the increase of age. The incidence of hearing loss in young patients was statistically different from that in elderly patients (P<0.05). The incidence of hearing loss in the middle-aged group was also statistically different from that in the elderly group (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in the incidence of hearing loss between the young group and the middle-aged group.

**Conclusion:**
Diabetic patients have an earlier onset and a higher inci- dence of hearing loss than non-diabetic patients. It is necessary to be alert to the occurrence of hearing loss in diabetic patients, and early hearing screening, diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis.

**Background and aims:**
Psychiatric disorders result from a mix of genetic, biological, and environmental influences, often reflected in intermediate traits known as endophenotypes. Studies suggests that glycaemic dysregulation is part of some psychiatric endopheno- types. Blood sugar disorder, insulin resistance, and abnormal glucose responses have been linked to depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The relationship between metabolic traits and psychiatric conditions is increasingly recognized, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Genetic risk markers for many glycaemic traits have been identified and calculating polygenic risk scores (PRS) allow us to investigate their influence on psychiatric endophenotypes. This approach provides a powerful tool for uncovering shared biological pathways between metabolic and psychiatric traits. We aimed to inves- tigate the association between glycaemic traits and psychiatric endo- phenotypes using polygenic risk scores (PRS) in European ancestry individuals.

**Materials and methods:**
This study used individual-level data from the UK Biobank, a large cohort of adults aged 40-69 years who pro- vided genetic, health, and lifestyle information. Ethical approval was granted from the UK Biobank Ethics Committee, and informed con- sent was obtained from all participants. Only unrelated individuals of European ancestry were included, with White British participants (n=3104663-68844) for discovery and White non-British Europeans (n=50,278) for replication. The psychiatric endophenotypes analysed were neuroticism (continuous) and risk-taking behaviour (binary). PRS for glycaemic traits (fasting insulin, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), 2-hour glucose, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) were calculated using genome-wide association stud- ies (GWAS) summary statistics from the MAGIC consortium. Analy- ses involved linear and logistic regression, controlling for covariates including age, sex, BMI, smoking, medication use, and population structure.

**Results:**
In the White British cohort, a PRS for increased fasting insu- lin was significantly associated with higher neuroticism, while PRS for increased fasting insulin and increased 2-hour glucose were associated with lower risk-taking behaviour. In the White European replication cohort, the direction of effects was consistent, although associations were not statistically significant.

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrated associations between glycae- mic traits and psychiatric endophenotypes, showing similar effect sizes across White British and White European groups. These findings suggest a potential role for glycaemic regulation in shaping psychiat- ric traits and highlight the need for further research in more diverse populations.

**High levels of HbA were associated with cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities in lacunar stroke patients**

H. Park

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus(DM) is one of major risk factors for stroke including small vessel disease. There are sev- eral indicators of cerebral small vessel state, including white matter hyperintensities(WMHs) and cerebral microbleeds(CMBs). The associ- ation of indicators between DM and brain microvascular status remains limited. We investigated which biomarkers of DM are associated with brain damages in DM patients with lacunar stroke.

**Materials and methods:**
From January 2010 to May 2020, patients with DM and acute lacunar infarction were selected from among those admitted to a University Hospital. All participants filled out a diabetes questionnaire and underwent blood tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging on admission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between DM duration, insulin injection history, and HbA1c levels with CMBs or WMHs.

**Results:**
Total Of 633 enrolled subjects, 120(19%) had CMBs and higher HbA1c, defined as 7.5% or higher, was independently associated with CMBs. In patients with concomitant essential hypertension(HT), higher HbA1c levels were associated with WMH and CMB, even after adjusting for age and gender. Duration of diabetes or history of insulin injections was not associated with brain markers.

**Conclusion:**
In patients with DM who had suffered a lacunar stroke, higher HbA1c levels were associated with CMBs. Additionally, higher HbA1c was associated with WMH grades in patients with DM and HT. These findings suggest that controlling diabetes is important for people with brain small vessel disease.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk of dementia, but the global dementia burden attributable to T2DM and the impact of modifiable risk factors remain unclear. This study aims to (1) assess the association between T2DM and dementia, (2) quantify the current and projected global attributable risk, and (3) identify modifiable risk factors and their potential impact on dementia prevention.

**Materials and methods:**
This study utilized data from the UK Biobank and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021. In the UK Biobank cohort (n = 389,186; 16-year follow-up), propensity score matching, Cox proportional hazards regression, and cumulative inci- dence functions were employed to examine the association between T2DM and dementia. To estimate the global and regional burden of dementia attributable to T2DM, we incorporated prevalence data from the GBD 2021, calculated the population-attributable fraction (PAF), and projected the PAF through 2050 using the weighted mean of his- torical changes. Additionally, in a subset of UK Biobank participants with T2DM at baseline (n = 22,338), multivariable Cox regressions were used to identify modifiable risk factors for dementia. A total of 51 risk factors spanning eight domains were examined. Individual and joint PAFs were estimated to assess the potential impact of modifying these factors on dementia prevention.

**Results:**
Individuals with T2DM had a significantly higher lifetime risk of dementia compared to those without diabetes (13.63% vs. 9.65%), reaching a 5%-risk threshold 3 years earlier (77 vs. 80 years). This gap widened to 6.1 years for those diagnosed with T2DM at ages 30-44. Globally, 16.85% of dementia cases (9.57 million) in 2021 were attrib- utable to T2DM. We projected that the population-attributable fraction (PAF) would rise to 25.4% by 2050. Fifteen modifiable risk factors were identified, including low education, unemployment, hypertension, high HbA1c, unfavorable dietary habits (red meat, fruit, and fish con- sumption), low physical activity, alcohol intoxication, depression, coro- nary heart disease, stroke, hearing impairment, low handgrip strength, and low forced vital capacity. Modifying these factors could prevent 38.1%-52.1% of dementia cases in individuals with T2DM, even among those with high genetic risk (36.8%-46.6% reduction).

**Conclusion:**
T2DM is a growing contributor to the global demen- tia burden, with its impact expected to rise through 2050. Targeted interventions in metabolic health, disease management, lifestyle, and education could significantly mitigate dementia risk in T2DM, even among genetically susceptible individuals.

**GLP-1 receptor agonist and metformin alleviate diabetes-asso- ciated cognitive impairment via the ANGPTL8-pirb signalling pathway**

X. Zhou

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes-associated cognitive impairment (DACI) is a severe complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that significantly affects quality of life. Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) plays a key role in metabolic regulation and is highly expressed in diabetic brain tissues. By activating paired immunoglob- ulin-like receptor B (PirB), ANGPTL8 might trigger neuroinflamma- tion and synaptic dysfunction, exacerbating cognitive impairment. This study explores the long-term effects of GLP-1 receptor agonist (Liraglutide) and Metformin on DACI and their regulation of the ANGPTL8-PirB signaling pathway.

**Materials and methods:**
Nine-week-old male ob/ob (pre-diabetes model) and db/db (T2DM model) mice were assigned to diabetes model (ob, db), Metformin (obT1, dbT1; 250 mg/kg·d gavage), and Liraglutide (obT2, dbT2; 200 μg/kg·d subcutaneous injection) groups, with C57BL/6J mice as controls (NC). After eight weeks, cognitive function was assessed using Barnes maze and novel object recogni- tion tests. ANGPTL8, synaptic/axonal markers, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in circulation, cerebrospinal fluid, and hip- pocampal tissues. Recombinant ANGPTL8 protein (rA8) was used to study its effects on primary neurons and microglia, while PirB block- ade validated its role in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. Insulin secretion tests, blood glucose, lipid profile, and liver/kidney function were also evaluated.

**Results:**
Both drugs significantly reduced ANGPTL8 expression in cir- culation, cerebrospinal fluid, and hippocampal tissues (P<0.05), with Liraglutide having a stronger effect. ANGPTL8 downregulated synap- tic/axonal markers via PirB while upregulating microglial pro-inflam- matory cytokines. Insulin secretion tests showed improved glucose metabolism in ob/ob and db/db mice, particularly in the Liraglutide group (P<0.05). Liraglutide also more effectively reduced GLU, TC, and LDL-c while increasing HDL-c compared to Metformin (P<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
ANGPTL8 plays a key role in DACI by activating PirB, promoting neuroinflammation, and impairing synaptic function. Both Metformin and Liraglutide alleviate DACI by reducing ANGPTL8 expression and improving insulin resistance, with Liraglutide having a greater effect. This study establishes the ANGPTL8-PirB pathway as a potential therapeutic target for DACI.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a com- mon diabetes complication, may increase the risk of cognitive impair- ment and dementia. This study examined if DPN associated with higher risk of dementia and cerebrovascular disease in individuals with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

**Materials and methods:**
This register-based cohort study used data from Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen (diabetes outpatient clinic) and Dan- ish National Health Registries. Individuals without prior brain disease and available vibration perception threshold (VPT) measurements were included (1998-2020). Neuropathy was defined as VPT>25 V (loss protec- tive perception) or VPT>age-sex-height-adjusted thresholds (early-stage). All-cause dementia and cerebrovascular disease were identified via ICD- 10 and procedure codes. We used Poisson regression models to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of cerebrovascular disease and all-cause dementia in individuals with versus without neuropathy. Models were adjusted for age, sex, calendar year, diabetes duration, education, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, HbA1c, smoking, alcohol, and cardiovascular dis- ease. For dementia, adjustments also included depression. IRRs were mod- eled for T1D and T2D separately, and for both neuropathy definitions. In a subpopulation, adjustments also included nephropathy and retinopathy.

**Results:**
We included 5641 individuals with T1D (mean (SD) age 40.5 y (15.8), 45.3% female) and 9395 with T2D (age 59.9 y (13.0), 38.6% female). The overall IRR of dementia was 1.57 (CI 0.73-3.37) in T1D and 4.30 (CI 2.05-9.04) in T2D for persons with versus without neu- ropathy (25 cut off). For cerebrovascular disease, the overall IRRs were 1.51 (CI 1.15-1.99) in T1D and 1.48 (CI 1.20-1.83) in T2D. Addi- tional adjustment for retinopathy and nephropathy, only significantly impacted the IRR of cerebrovascular disease in T1D, resulting in an overall IRR of 1.18 (CI 0.87-1.60). Similar results were observed in early-stage neuropathy.

**Conclusion:**
DPN independently associated with increased dementia risk in T2D and cerebrovascular disease risk in both T1D and T2D, highlighting its potential role in identifying at-risk individuals.

**Early detection of choroid plexus volume and reduced cortical thickness in diabetic cognitive impairment**

S. Fan

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic cognitive impairment (DACI) is a prevalent neurodegenerative complication in elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The choroid plexus, a critical struc- ture for cerebrospinal fluid production, regulates brain homeostasis and metabolic waste clearance.While its role in cognitive decline in T2DM remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of blood sugar control on the glymphatic system in T2DM using MRI markers— choroid plexus volume (CPV), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), and diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS)—and explored their relationships with reduced cortical thickness and cognitive deficits.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included participants with T2DM and healthy controls (HCs) between March 2024 and January 2025. Participants underwent MRI scans and neuropsychological assess- ments. FreeSurfer was used for the segmentation of cortical areas and subcortical structures. The diabetes group was divided into two subgroups based on HbA1C, with a cutoff value of 7.5%.The MRI indices of glymphatic function were compared with cortical thickness and cognitive dysfunction. Spearman rank correlation, and mediation analyses were conducted.

**Results:**
A total of 99 HCs, 54 T2DM patients with poorly controlled diabetes, and 38 T2DM patients with well-controlled diabetes were included. The poorly controlled T2DM group and well-controlled T2DM group differed significantly from normal controls on MRI glymphatic measures of CPV (left: 1.28 vs. 1.27 vs. 1.09; right: 1.18 vs. 1.17 vs. 1.01; total: 2.45 vs. 2.43 vs. 2.11, p < 0.001), EPVS (0.62 vs. 0.53 vs. 0.44, p < 0.001), and DTI-ALPS (1.57 vs. 1.55 vs. 1.64, p < 0.001). The glymphatic system was significantly associated with cognitive performance. In the poorly controlled T2DM group, right CPV was negatively correlated with CFT-d. DTI-ALPS was positively correlated with MMSE. In the well-controlled T2DM group, right CPV was positively correlated with AVLT. Cortical thickness changes in different brain regions were explored. In the poorly controlled T2DM group, the insular cortical thickness was negatively correlated with TMT-A. Additionally, glymphatic system showed significant associa- tions with cortical thickness. In the poorly controlled group, the cortical thickness of the supramarginal gyrus was negatively correlated with CPV. In the well-controlled group, the cortical thickness of the insula was positively correlated with CPV. Mediation analyses revealed that CPV mediated the effect of HbA1C on insular cortical thickness.

**Conclusion:**
Our results suggest that glymphatic system is an impor- tant mediator of accelerated cognitive decline. Through subgroup analysis, we found that choroid plexus volume increases with diabetes severity and may serve as a key predictor of cognitive impairment onset and progression in diabetes. The glymphatic system and its underlying mechanisms warrant further exploration.

3. crinology and Diabetology, St. Gallen, Switzerland, Kantonsspital

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, leads to microvascular and macrovascular complica- tions, significantly impacting healthcare systems and patient quality of life. Strategies to reduce complications are vital to improving life expectancy and reducing healthcare costs. Recent guidelines from the ADA and EASD emphasize the importance of quality of life assess- ment using tools like the EQ-5D-3L. This study aimed to assess the association between quality of life and diabetes-related complications over time.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a longitudinal observational study based on patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus enrolled in SwissDiab between January 1st, 2015 and November 30th, 2022. Patients with ≥2 annually completed EQ-5D-3L questionnaires were eligible for analysis. The adapted Diabetes Complications Sever- ity Index (aDCSI) was used to quantify severity of complications. Associations between quality of life scores and diabetes-related com- plications were analysed using linear mixed-effects regression models, adjusted for patient characteristics and survey time.

**Results:**
Of 1216 identified patients, 896 were eligible for analysis; 474 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 62.3 years (+/- 10.9 years)) and 422 with type 1 diabetes (mean age 41.9 years (+/- 15.3 years)). At the first available study visit, 64.6% of the patients were diagnosed with ≥1 diabetes-related complication. The mean EQ-5D-3L utility scores were lower in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to type 1. Higher aDCSI scores were significantly associated with reduced EQ- 5D-3L utility scores in both diabetes types. Major complications like amputation and myocardial infarction significantly decreased quality of life scores. No decrement in quality of life over time was observed.

**Conclusion:**
Diabetes complications negatively impact quality of life, with higher aDCSI scores correlating with lower EQ-5D-3L utility scores. Gender differences were observed, with females reporting lower scores. The study’s findings highlight the need for effective manage- ment strategies to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes.

3. sity Medical Center, Maastricht, Netherlands, Maastricht University
4. Medical Centre, Maastricht, Netherlands, University Medical Center

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of depression, but the mechanisms underlying this association are incompletely understood. We investigated whether microvascular dysfunction, neurodegeneration, low-grade inflammation, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and arterial stiffness, pathologies that are more common in diabetes, explain, or mediate, the association between type 2 diabetes and incident clinically relevant depressive symptoms.

**Materials and methods:**
We used prospective data from The Maas- tricht Study, a population-based cohort study. Diabetes status and potential mediators were assessed at baseline. Clinically relevant depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥10) were assessed at baseline and each year during a median of 8.1 (IQR 4.2, 10.1) years of follow-up. Mediation analysis was employed to investigate the mediating effect by microvascular dysfunction (retinal, blood and MRI biomarkers), neu- rodegeneration (retina and MRI biomarkers), low-grade inflammation (blood biomarkers), AGEs (skin and blood biomarkers) and arterial stiffness (tonometry and ultrasound biomarkers).

**Results:**
Data of 6,091 participants (age, 59.4 years [SD 8.6]; 51.3% women; 23.6% type 2 diabetes) were available. Type 2 diabetes was associated with a higher incidence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms (HR:1.37; 95%CI 1.13, 1.65). This association was partly mediated by microvascular dysfunction (proportion mediated:10.4% [95%CI:3.6%, 17.2%]); neurodegeneration (proportion mediated:12.1% [95%CI: 3.9%, 20.3 %]); AGEs (proportion mediated:5.4% [95%CI: 3.0%, 8.8 %]; and arterial stiffness (proportion mediated:8.4% [95%CI: 3.3%, 13.5%]); but not by low-grade inflammation.

**Conclusion:**
The association between type 2 diabetes and higher risk of clinically relevant depressive symptoms is partly mediated by micro- vascular dysfunction, neurodegeneration, AGEs and arterial stiffness.

5. Germany, FIDAM - Research Institute Diabetes Academy Mergen-

**Background and aims:**
In this study, we investigated the extent to which suboptimal glycaemic control in people with diabetes is asso- ciated with sleep quality. In addition, we prospectively analysed whether impaired sleep quality is associated with lower mood and energy ratings the next day and with a risk of depressive symptoms and increased diabetes distress at three months.

**Materials and methods:**
For 17 days, 379 people with type 1 (50.4%) and type 2 diabetes (49.6%) rated their sleep quality daily on a scale of 0 to 10 using an EMA app on their smartphone. They also rated their mood and energy levels 4 times a day. At the same time, glycae- mic control was continuously measured by CGM and quantified using established CGM metrics. At the 3-month follow-up, depressive symp- toms (CES-D questionnaire; cut-off for increased depressive symptoms: 22) and diabetes distress (PAID questionnaire; cut-off for increased diabetes distress: 40) were assessed. The influence of glycaemic control on sleep quality and the impact of sleep quality of mood and energy level ratings was assessed using multilevel regression analyses (random factor: person). The prospective association between sleep quality and the risk of increased depressive symptoms and diabetes distress at 3 months was analysed with logistic regression analyses.

**Results:**
Data from 379 participants (were analysed. Nocturnal hypo- glycaemia (T=-2.18 p<.01) and hyperglycaemia (T=-4.08, p<0.001) were inversely associated with sleep quality. Good sleep quality in the morning was positively associated with higher levels of mood (T=12.3; p<001) and energy (T=25.2; p<001) during the day. Poorer sleep qual- ity during the 17-day period was significantly associated with a higher risk of elevated depressive symptoms and diabetes distress after three month, as well as with a higher incidence of elevated depressive symp- toms and diabetes distress and a lower remission rate (see figure 1).

**Conclusion:**
Nocturnal hypo- and hyperglycaemia reduced sleep qual- ity. Poorer sleep quality was associated with lower mood and energy levels on the following day. Prospectively, poorer sleep quality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes in terms of increased depressive symptoms and distress, as well as higher incidence and lower remission rates of these conditions. These findings highlight the importance of normoglycaemic metabolic control for good sleep qual- ity, which in turn plays a central role in the prevention of poor mental health in people with diabetes.

**Impact of eating disorders on mortality and cardiovascular out- comes in type 2 diabetes: a nationwide study**

S. Cho, G. Kim, J. Kim

**Background and aims:**
We investigated the impact of eating disorders (ED) on all-cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease (CVD), cardiovascular (CV)-related mortality, and CV hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

**Materials and methods:**
This nationwide retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 1,896,616 adults aged 20 years and older who underwent health examinations between 2013 and 2014. Time-varying Cox analyses were employed to assess the impact of ED on all-cause mortality, composite CVD, CV-related mortality, and CV hospitaliza- tion in patients with T2DM.

**Results:**
The T2DM group showed and increased incidence of ED (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.28) compared with the general population. Furthermore, the incidence of ED was higher among insulin users (aHR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09-1.54) compared to non-insulin users (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10- 1.27). The T2DM with ED group showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality (aHR, 2.29; 95% CI, 2.07-2.53), composite CVD (aHR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.65), CV-related mortality (aHR, 1,92; 95% CI, 1.52- 2.43), and CV hospitalization (aHR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.29-1.62).

**Conclusion:**
T2DM and ED both increased all-cause mortality, com- posite CVD, CV-related mortality, and CV hospitalization. The inci- dence of ED was higher among insulin users with T2DM. Therefore, early diagnosis and personalized intervention are crucial to improving outcomes in this high-risk population.

1. Freedom from Diabetes Research Foundation, Pune, India, Diabetes

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are major public health concerns in India, leading to poor glycemic control and increased risk of psychological concerns like anxiety and depression. Effective interventions are needed to address both metabolic and men- tal health outcomes. This study evaluated the impact of a multidis- ciplinary lifestyle-based diabetes management program on physical (weight, BMI, and glycemic parameters) and mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety) in Indian individuals with T2D and obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective quasi-experimental study included patients with T2D (>18 years) and obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/ m²) enrolled in a multidisciplinary diabetes management program in India from June 2021 to February 2025. The intervention comprised a plant-based diet, physical activity, psychological support, and medical management. Data on anthropometry, medical history, biochemical parameters, and symptoms of depression and anxiety (via PHQ-9 and GAD-7) were collected at baseline and after one year.

**Results:**
The study analyzed 859 patients with T2D (165 pre-diabetes; 51.3% male). The mean age and diabetes duration were 51.8 ± 9.7 years and 9.1 ± 7.8 years, respectively. Baseline weight, BMI, and HbA1c lev- els were 80.7 ± 14.6 kg, 29.6 ± 4.0 kg/m², and 7.9 ± 1.7%, respectively. Obesity Class I (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m²) comprised 64.8% of the cohort, while 35.2% had Class II obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²). Post-intervention, significant improvements were observed: Mean weight decreased from 80.6 to 73.9 kg, and BMI from 29.6 to 27.1 kg/m² (p < 0.001), with large effect sizes (𝑑;=1.2) indicating clinically meaningful changes. Signifi- cant decrease was seen in HbA1c levels (7.9% to 6.7%) (d=0.7), fast- ing glucose (138.7 mg/dL to 123.1 mg/dL) (𝑑;=0.3), and postprandial glucose (171.4 mg/dL to 146.8 mg/dL) (𝑑;=0.3) (p  < 0.05). Depression and anxiety prevalence decreased from 49% to 30% and from 45.5% to 32.2%, respectively. Median scores for both conditions decreased from 4 to 2 across the cohort (p < 0.001). Among 169 patients with moderate-to- severe depression at baseline, 69% improved, with median scores decreas- ing from 13 to 7. Similarly, 69.2% of 142 patients with moderate-to-severe anxiety improved, with median scores dropping from 14 to 6. Partici- pants with Class II obesity showed significantly higher mental health improvements than those with Class I obesity, with greater reductions in depressive symptoms (mean PHQ-9 score difference: 2.3 vs. 1.7) and anxiety (mean GAD-7 score difference: 1.8 vs. 1.3) (p < 0.001). These findings highlight a strong correlation between reduced obesity severity and improved mental health outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
The study demonstrates that a multidisciplinary lifestyle- based diabetes management program significantly improves both meta- bolic and mental health outcomes in individuals with T2D and obesity. Greater reductions in obesity severity were associated with better mental health improvements, emphasizing the need for holistic interventions in diabetes care.

**Background and aims:**
Little is known about the longitudinal interaction between health-risk behaviours and individual depressive symptoms in people with diabetes. A complex dynamic systems approach may provide new insights into this relationship. This study examined longitudinal net- works of health-risk behaviours and depressive symptoms in people with diabetes and compared to those without.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of N = 22,510 participants from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe were included, comprising n = 1,781 individuals with diabetes and n = 20,729 without. Only those with complete data on smoking, alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical inactivity, and depressive symptoms (EURO-D) were included. Cross-lagged panel models were employed to examine the temporal relationships between individual depressive symptoms and, separately, between depressive symptoms and health-risk behaviours over 2 years.

**Results:**
Results indicated that physical inactivity was by far the most strongly connected behaviour to depressive symptoms, whereas smok- ing, alcohol consumption, and fruit and vegetable consumption showed minimal connections to depressive symptoms. Networks were more densely connected for people without diabetes. Among people with diabetes, physical inactivity triggered depressive symptoms rather than being activated by them, whereas this relationship was bidirectional in those without diabetes. In contrast, sleep problems exhibited bidirectional relationships with other depressive symptoms for people with diabetes, but were not strongly influenced by depressive symptoms in individuals without diabetes.

**Conclusion:**
Findings suggest nuanced structural differences between people with and without diabetes in in the role of symptoms and behav- iours in longitudinal networks (as drivers or recipients of activation) between people with and without diabetes. Such investigations hold prom- ise for informing precision mental health care in people with diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
We recently demonstrated a causal effect of depression on type 2 diabetes (T2D) diabetes and identified seven shared genetic loci. One possible mechanism underlying this rela- tionship is the physiological role of GLP-1R, which is expressed in both the gut and the brain. Given the frequent mood-related side effects of GLP-1R agonists and their association with depressive symptoms, studying loss- and gain-of-function missense variants in — which alter receptor structure and function— alongside the genetic background of individual responses, warrants further investigation.

**Materials and methods:**
We analysed 123 missense variants in the gene using whole-exome sequencing data from the UK Biobank. These variants were assessed for associations with several phenotypes, including blood glucose levels, T2D, body mass index (BMI), and depressive symptoms. From this initial set, we selected 72 variants overlapping with findings from functional and structural analy- ses. To explore the relationships between these variants, we performed hierarchical clustering. Based on the clustering results, the variants were grouped into relevant categories, and subsequently conducted the SKAT-O test to evaluate the combined association of variants with the phenotypes of interest.

**Results:**
We defined five distinct clusters of variant pathophysi- ological effects. Higher BMI/T2D-Depression risk cluster associated with higher BMI/blood glucose/depression severity. Depression risk cluster at the same time had lowering effects on adiposity/glucose/T2D risk. Glucose/T2D risk lowering cluster showed an inverse effect on BMI with variants related to higher adiposity and no risk of depression or its symptoms. Higher glucose cluster was associated with T2D and elevated blood glucose levels. Higher adiposity cluster exhibited high BMI along with lower glucose levels and reduced T2D risk.

**Conclusion:**
We report mechanistic heterogeneity of variant effects on glucose metabolism, adiposity and depressive symptoms. These mechanistic clusters suggest that individuals treated with GLP- 1R mimetics might respond differently to treatment, depending on their genetic composition. These insights could inform the development of stratified therapeutic strategies to improve treatment strategies.

**Background and aims:**
Heart failure (HF) is the most prevalent cardiovascular complication in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is an independent pre- dictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including HF development and progression. However, its role in the pathophysiology of heart failure requires further elucidation. The aim of this study was to describe the distribution of various measures of heart failure among people with T2D who are receiving secondary care in outpatient diabetes clinics and to quantify the association between CAN and these heart failure indicators.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 200 participants with T2D were randomly recruited from 2 diabetes outpatient clinics located in the Central Region of Denmark between 2021 and 2024. Measures of heart failure included N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels to identify individuals with early asympto- matic heart failure (elevated levels: >125 pg/ml), the WATCH-DM risk score (high risk: >11, based on a score including age, body mass index, creatinine, prior MI or coronary artery bypass grafting, HbA1c, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure), and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) clas- sification (symptoms: classification ≥2). With age-specific cut-off values applied to determine abnormal results, CAN was defined by the presence of two or more abnormal cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between CAN and heart failure indicators, adjusting for demograph- ics, clinical risk factors, and prior CVD.

**Results:**
Among 136 participants with complete data, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 62 (54, 69) years, and 64% were men. The median duration of diabetes was 16 years (IQR: 11, 23) and 36% had CAN. The proportion of participants with elevated NT- proBNP was 35%, while 24% had symptoms based on the NYHA classification, and 30% were categorized as high risk based on the WATCH-DM score. Among those with CAN, 52% had elevated NT- proBNP compared to 23% of those without CAN (Figure A). In the fully adjusted model, CAN was associated with 6.2 times higher odds (95%-CI: 1.9, 19.6) of elevated NT-proBNP (Figure B). Sensitivity analyses excluding participants on beta-blockers, those with prior CVD, or those with any symptoms based on the NYHA classification did not change the direction of the association.

**Conclusion:**
CAN was associated with elevated NT-proBNP, sug- gesting that the presence of CAN may also identify people with HF in earlier asymptomatic stages, that are most amenable to disease modification and this association is independent of other traditional risk factors.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with increased risk of bone fractures, which may be caused by suppressed bone formation. Similarly, glucocorticoid (GC) treatment leads to suppressed bone formation, in addition to increased resorption. It is unknown whether GC treatment alters fracture risk equally in sub- jects with and subjects without T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
A nationwide registry-based self-controlled cohort study was performed to investigate the individual and com- bined effects of T2D and systemic GCs on risk of major osteoporo- tic fractures (MOFs), defined as fractures of the hips, vertebrae, humerus, or forearm. Individuals with or without T2D receiving systemic GC treatment (≥1 redeemed prescription) between 2000 and 2018 were identified and followed during treatment. For each individual, the comparator for GC treatment consisted of the two years immediately prior to treatment in the same individual. For confounding control, we used standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) weighting. Each group (with/without T2D and with/without GC) was reweighted to resemble the T2D group in the GC treatment period. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated using a zero-inflated nega- tive binomial model with T2D, GC treatment, and an interaction term between the two as predictors. An interaction >1 represents a larger effect of GC among the T2D group than in the non-T2D group.

**Results:**
We included 477,605 individuals (27,942 with T2D) with a total follow-up time of 1,354,913 person-years. A total of 21,391 MOFs were observed. Median follow-up time was 35 days (with a mean of 210 days) during GC treatment and 731 days in the pre-treatment period. After weighting, GC treatment was associated with an IRR of 1.71 [1.56-1.86], with no interaction with T2D (IRR 1.01 [0.87-1.17]). These results were similar across subgroup and sensitivity analyses; when stratifying by sex (males vs. females) or age (<65 years, 65-74 years, and ≥75 years), when setting GC-period follow-up to 2 years regardless of treatment duration, when allowing the effects of GC treatment to vary smoothly as a function of time- since-initiation, and when accounting for differences in daily dosage with different durations of treatment.

**Conclusion:**
We found that systemic GC use increases fracture risk equally in individuals with and individuals without T2D. While there is no potentiating effect, individuals with T2D receiving GC treatment experience increased risk through multiple paths, and care should be taken when prescribing GCs in this population.

**Characteristics and impact of diabetes and prediabetes in pre-**

**Background and aims:**
Discussion is still ongoing on the prevalence and characteristics of diabetes (DM) and prediabetes (PD) [IFG and/ or IGT] in patients before and after liver transplantation (LTx), and the impact on post-LTx outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
In this single center study we evaluated 1,467 candidates for LTx [age: 57 (51-62) yrs; M/F: 1,106/361; BMI: 25.2 (23.0-27.6) Kg/m²; family history of diabetes (FHD): 37%; FPG: 99 (89-117) mg/dl; HbA1c: 5.2 (4.7-5.7%); metabolic syndrome: 28% (ascites excluded)] whose main indications for LTx were: 57.7% HCV/ HBV-related cirrhosis/HCC, and 27.5% dysmetabolic/esotoxic cirrho- sis/HCC. By the end of 2024, 1,112 subjects underwent LTx.

**Results:**
Based on pre-LTX history, FPG, HbA1c and/or OGTT, 32.5% patients from the pre-LTX cohort had DM and 21.4% PD. DM and PD patients were older and predominantly males (both p<0.001), had lower levels HDL-cholesterol and eGFR compared to NGT (p<0,05). Moreover, DM had a stronger FHD (54%) and prevalence of dysmeta- bolic cirrhosis (22%) vs PD and NGT (all p<0,05). In the transplanted cohort, cumulative patient and graft survival at the end of the 12-yrs follow-up were respectively 69% and 65%. Among other factors, pre- LTx PD, DM with HbA1c >7% and DM with > 10 yrs duration were all associated with decreased patient survival (p<0.05). Detailed metabolic status was re-assessed in 470 LTx patients with at least 5 yrs follow-up. The proportion of post-LTx PD and DM significantly increased (both p<0.05) 5 yrs post-LTx vs pre-LTx (29 vs 22% for PD and 48 vs 32% for DM). At multivariate analysis, the presence of pre- LTx PD (OR= 6.0; CI 95% 3.1-11.7) and increased BMI (OR= 1.2; CI 95% 1.1-1.6) correlated with new onset DM after LTx (NODAT). To identify pre-LTx variables associated with NODAT, machine learn- ing algorithms (both interpretable and explainable) were used and the models indicated that pre-LTx FPG, BMI, smoking and eGFR were among the main factors leading to NODAT.

**Conclusion:**
This large single-center study: 1) implements previously available data and demonstrates a high prevalence of DM and PD (> 50%) in LTx candidates, which further increases after transplantation (reaching > 70%); 2) identifies factors associated with NODAT; 3) indicates that PD and not well-controlled and/or long-lasting (> 10 yrs) DM can worsen survival post-LTx. The information obtained may contribute to improving the life expectancy and quality of life in liver transplant recipients.

**Background and aims:**
The treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has changed, with the emergence of novel, often more expensive drugs targeting cardiovascular (CV) protection. This periodic, cross-sectional study evaluates long-term trends in T2D-related pharmacotherapy cost and CV risk factor control in patients with T2D from tertiary diabetes centers in Greece.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from 4,963 patients with T2D who had at least two visits to one of three tertiary diabetes centers dur- ing the years 1998, 2006, 2012, 2018 and 2024 were analyzed. Key clinical parameters (HbA1c, systolic blood pressure [SBP], LDL-C, and BMI) and monthly drug cost (for antidiabetic, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antiplatelet agents) were collected and compared across five-time points (1998, 2006, 2012, 2018, and 2024). Cost was calculated using official retail prices, adjusted for inflation.

**Results:**
In 2024, 63.5% of patients achieved HbA1c <7%, 66.0% had SBP <140 mmHg and 78.9% reached LDL-C <100 mg/dL. The percentage of patients achieving all three CV risk targets improved progressively over successive time points: 1.0% (1998), 14.0% (2006), 21.9% (2012), 31.7% (2018), and 35.4% (2024). Notably, the percent- age of patients achieving LDL-C target improved across all time points, including between 2018 and 2024 (72.5% vs. 78.9%). Total pharmaco- therapy costs rose during the last six years (€95.0 in 2018 vs. €134.1 in 2024). This increase was mainly driven by an increase in the cost of antidiabetic drugs, from €71.7 in 2018 to €104.7 in 2024, and of lipid-lowering agents (€12. 6vs €18) respectively. Conversely, the cost for antihypertensive ((€8. 6 vs. €8.8), and antiplatelet drugs (€2.1 Vs €2.5) remained relatively stable. Multivariate analysis revealed that antidiabetic drug costs in 2024 were independently associated with longer diabetes duration, higher HbA1c, higher BMI, and the use of newer drug agents.

**Conclusion:**
From 1998 to 2024, patients with T2D in Greece demon- strated improved achievement of CV risk factor targets, particularly in LDL-C. Overall, pharmacotherapy costs rose significantly, primarily due to the uptake of newer antidiabetic agents and the intensification of lipid-lowering treatment.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in people living with diabetes. Internationally, social deprivation is associated with an increased risk of DKD but there is limited literature on rate of decline in renal func- tion. This study aims to explore the impact of social deprivation on rate of decline in renal function in a cohort of adults living with diabetes in the West of Ireland.

**Materials and methods:**
Retrospective cohort study of people with diabetes attending specialist ambulatory diabetes service at a single ter- tiary referral centre between 2012 and 2016 and linkage to laboratory data (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) until January 2023. Baseline clinical variables included diabetes duration, smoking status, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), HbA1c, eGFR, urine albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Deprivation indices were assigned based on home address. Descriptive statistics compared baseline characteristics by deprivation level and by type of diabetes. Linear mixed effect models estimated absolute and percent decline in renal function (eGFR). Linear and logistic regres- sion analyses assessed the relationship between deprivation and rate of decline in renal function, with adjustment for potential confounding variables.

**Results:**
Deprivation indices were assigned to 4069 individuals and 3457 of these had longitudinal eGFR data available for analysis. Base- line analysis of the total cohort revealed a higher proportion of smok- ers, higher BMI, higher SBP, higher uACR and lower eGFR in more deprived categories (p <0.05 for all). Individuals with type 1 diabetes in the deprived category had a higher baseline HbA1c, higher uACR and lower eGFR compared with those in the affluent category (p <0.05 for all). Individuals with type 2 diabetes in the deprived category had a higher BMI, higher SBP, and were more likely to smoke compared with those in the affluent category (p <0.05 for all). Linear regression analysis of the total cohort showed a significant association between deprivation and rate of decline in renal function (p= 0.016), which did not persist following adjustment for HbA1c, diabetes duration, baseline eGFR, BMI, SBP, smoking status and LDL cholesterol (p = 0.106).

**Conclusion:**
In this cohort, baseline clinically significant variables dif- fered across socioeconomic category in people with diabetes. Regres- sion analysis showed an association between deprivation and rate of decline in renal function, which was attenuated following adjustment for risk factors. A higher prevalence of risk factors for DKD in deprived populations may explain some of the inequity in the burden of DKD and targeted preventative interventions may help to close the gap.

**Background and aims:**
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent a common and clinically significant burden, particularly among individu- als with diabetes. However, reliable predictive biomarkers for UTI risk remain scarce. Concerns about a potential increased risk of UTI with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may discourage their use, especially in high-risk patients. This study aimed to evaluate the association between baseline urinary dipstick findings and UTI risk, and assessed whether these biomarkers modify the effect of canagli- flozin on UTI outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
A pooled analysis was conducted using patient-level data from the CANVAS and CREDENCE trials, both of which were double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome was the time to the first UTI, and the secondary outcome was the total number of UTI events, analyzed using Cox and Andersen-Gill models, with baseline leukocyte esterase (LE) and nitrite as effect modifiers.

**Results:**
Among 8,614 participants with available baseline dipstick results, abnormal LE (10.7%) and nitrite (3.5%) were more prevalent in older patients and females. After adjusting for confounders, abnormal LE was significantly associated with an increased risk of first UTI, with a stepwise escalation observed across LE categories (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.72 [1+], 1.92 [2+], 2.81 [3+] vs. normal), irrespective of treatment assignment. Similarly, abnormal nitrite was linked to higher UTI risk (HR: 2.28 [1+], 1.66 [2+] vs. normal). The analysis for secondary outcome yielded comparable findings. Compared to placebo, canagli- flozin did not increase the risk of the first UTI (HR: 1.07; 95% confi- dence interval [CI]: 0.93-1.22) or total UTI events (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.86-1.17). Furthermore, LE and nitrite, when categorized as normal or abnormal, did not significantly modify the effect of canagliflozin on the first UTI risk (P for interaction = 0.10 and 0.45, respectively, Figure). However, for the total UTI events, significant heterogeneity was detected in the LE subgroup (P for interaction <0.01), with cana- gliflozin increasing the UTI risk among those with normal LE (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.03-1.49) while reducing the risk in participants with abnormal LE (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.58-0.99).

**Conclusion:**
Abnormal baseline urinary dipstick findings, specifically LE and nitrite, were associated with an increased risk of future devel- opment of UTI. However, withholding SGLT2 inhibitors in patients at high risk for UTI based on dipstick testing is not justified.

3. of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia, retired,

**Background and aims:**
Published data on the prevalence of foot pathologies in the population of patients with diabetes mellitus vary widely. Following the establishment of the National Working Group on the Diabetic Foot, mandatory foot screening was introduced in the Diabetes Outpatient Clinic in 1996. The test was performed on all patients registered at the clinic before 1996, and thereafter on all newly diagnosed type 2 patients at the time of diagnosis and on all newly diagnosed type 1 patients five years after diagnosis. Data stored in a computerized database were analyzed to support resource planning.

**Materials and methods:**
The screening protocol was developed by the national working group and follows the protocol recommended by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF). It includes medical history (previous ulceration, amputation, symptoms of neuropathy), physical examination (foot deformity, loss of protective sensation (LOPS, 10-g monofilament), peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD, palpation of foot pulses)) and risk status assignment (0 - very low: no LOPS, no PAD; 1 - low: LOPS or PAD; 2 - moderate: LOPS and PAD, LOPS and foot deformity, PAD and foot deformity; 3 - high: LOPS or PAD and one or more of the following criteria: His- tory of foot ulcer, lower limb amputation (minor or major), end-stage renal disease).

**Results:**
Between January 1996 and December 2024, 17,672 patients (mean age 60.6 ± 14.0 years, 43.2 % women) were examined. 415 patients (2.3 %) had a previous amputation and 1,786 (10.1 %) a previous foot ulcer. 7,488 (42.4 %) reported various neuropathic symptoms. Claw/hammer toes were noted in 3,855 (21.8%), fat pad atrophy in 944 (5.4%), abundant callus in 3,412 (19.3%) and dry skin in 6,340 (35.9%). LOPS was found in 2,930 patients (16.6%) and PAD (at least one foot pulse not palpable) in 1,567 (8.9%), all four in 856 (4.8%). An open ulcer was found in 1,125 (6.3%). Risk status: 0: 13,809 patients (78.1%), 1: 628 (3,.6%), 2: 2,027 (11.5%), 3: 1,208 (6.8%).

**Conclusion:**
A comprehensive database on foot pathology was col- lected over 28 years. The data analysis provides good estimates of the prevalence of neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease and is important for resource planning.

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a well rec- ognised complication of diabetes. To ensure flight safety pilots with insulin-treated diabetes granted medical certification to fly in the UK, Ireland and Austria under the ARA.MED.330 diabetes protocol must undergo regular cardiovascular assessment. The use of risk calculators to estimate the 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event occurring in pilots with insulin-treated diabetes is evaluated.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective, multicentred, observa- tional study collected clinical data from databases held by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, Irish Aviation Authority and Austrocontrol on CVD risk factors for pilots with insulin-treated diabetes granted medical certification to fly under the diabetes protocol between May 2012 and April 2024. The ­QRisk 3, Steno1 and Score2-Diabetes risk calculators were used to calculate the risk of a cardiovascular event occurring within the next 10-years at the time of pilots’ initial medical review and at their most recent clinical review.

**Results:**
Eighty-four pilots with type 1 (82%), type 2 (13%) or type 3c diabetes (5%) awarded a class 1 (52%), class 2 (42%) or light air- craft pilots’ licence (6%) medical certificate were studied. Most were male (96%) with a median age of 51.8 years (IQR 38.9-59.5), median diabetes duration of 15.3 years (IQR 10.5-19.3) and mean HbA1c of 53.7 ±7.8 mmol/mol (7.1 ±0.7%) on ­1 April 2024. In all pilots with insulin-treated diabetes (n=84) the mean 10-year ­QRisk 3 score was 7.0 ±7.0% at initial review and 10.3 ±8.3% after an average of 5.8 years. In the risk calculators age, sex and ethnicity matched control group the mean 10-year ­QRisk 3 score was 2.5 ±3.1% and 4.1 ±4.2% at the initial and most recent reviews respectively. The mean Steno1 10-year risk for pilots with type 1 diabetes (n=69) was 6.7 ±5.1% at initial review and 9.1 ±6.3% after an average of 5.8 years compared to 6.1 ±3.7% and 8.0 ±4.6% respectively in the risk engine’s control group. The mean Score2-Diabetes 10-year risk for pilots with type 2 diabetes (n=16) was 8.0 ±4.0% at initial assess- ment and 10.6 ±3.6% after an average of 5.8 years. No control group data was provided.

**Conclusion:**
Risk calculators may be a useful adjunct to estimate 10-year CVD risk in pilots with insulin-treated diabetes. Only the Steno1 and Score2-diabetes calculators consider glycaemic control in their matrix. Despite this, risk scores were similar amongst all three calculators.

Since 2018, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP- 1RA) and SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are strongly recommended in guidelines for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascu- lar disease (CVD), independent of HbA1c-levels, based on evidence from major cardiovascular outcome trials. This study aimed to evaluate adherence to these guideline recommendations using real-world data from the large, prospective Diabetes Follow-up Registry (DPV).

**Materials and methods:**
This analysis included 74,462 patients with T2D aged 18-75 years, with data collected between May 31, 2018, and May 31, 2024. Anthropometric parameters (age, sex, body mass index), clinical characteristics (diabetes duration, diabetes therapy, concomi- tant medications) and metabolic parameters (fasting glucose, HbA1c, renal function) were assessed. Comorbidities related to CVD includ- ing peripheral arterial disease, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke and cerebral vessel stenosis, were documented. Patients with end-stage renal disease or those with a history of kidney transplanta- tion were excluded from analysis. Group comparisons were conducted using t-tests (for normally distributed variables), Mann-Whitney U tests (for non-normally distributed variables), and chi-square tests (for categorical variables).

**Results:**
Among the 74,462 patients with T2D, 20,561 (27.6%) had established CVD, while 53,901 (72.4%) did not. Patients with CVD were significantly older compared to those without CVD (66.9 years vs. 61.5 years, p<0.001), had a longer diabetes duration (11.4 vs. 7.0 years, p<0.001), and exhibited worse kidney function (GFR CKD-EPI 76 vs. 98 ml/min, p<0.001). Weight and BMI were similar between both groups (weight: 92.5 vs. 92.0 kg, p=0.12; BMI: 31.18 vs. 31.24, p=0.41). Patients with CVD showed better glycemic control, with sig- nificantly lower fasting glucose levels (147 vs. 148.5 mg/dL, p<0.001) and HbA1c values (7.21% vs. 7.38%, p<0.001). The use of guideline- recommended therapies was significantly higher in patients with CVD, with 29.55% receiving SGLT2i compared to 20.22% of those without CVD (p<0.001), and 16.32% receiving GLP-1RA compared to 14.93% in the non-CVD group (p<0.001). The combined use of both drug classes was documented in 8.13% of patients with CVD versus 5.76% of those without (p<0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Although patients with T2D and CVD were more likely to receive SGLT2i and GLP-1RA as compared to those without CVD, the overall adherence to guideline-recommended therapy remains insufficient. More than half of the patients with established CVD did not receive these evidence-based treatments. Given the strong link between diabetes and cardiovascular disease, guideline-directed treat- ment should be prioritized, independent of HbA1c levels. A more integrated, interdisciplinary approach is urgently needed to optimize cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with T2DM.

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) could have a different impact on isometric or isotonic muscle contraction. Indeed, T1D could negatively affect motor unit recruitment. Among several evaluation pro- tocols, isometric maximal strength testing is widely used in research. However, the Chair Stand Test (CST) have become a relevant tool to assess isotonic performance due to its simple use and clinical relevance. This study investigated the differences in muscular fitness components between individuals with and without T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
Sixty-seven individuals with T1D (31 females, 36 males; mean age of 38.9 ± 14.5 years; BMI: 25.9 ± 4.5 kg/m²) volunteered to participate in the study. They were physically active (1615.5 ± 2669.7 MET/week) with a mean disease duration of 19.0 ± 11.6 years. A control group (CG) of 70 participants (34 females, 36 males) matched for age, sex, BMI and physical activ- ity level was included for comparison. Muscular fitness assessments included: handgrip strength, measured on the dominant upper limb using a hand dynamometer; lower limb muscular strength, assessed with an isometric protocol consisting of five maximal contractions performed on the dominant limb; the rate of force development (RFD) in the early contraction phase (0-50 ms), as a power index; 10-repeti- tion CST as a lower limbs’ efficiency; and the Specific Power (SP) index (CST/skeletal muscle mass ratio) as a lower limb power index.

**Results:**
The CG completed the CST significantly faster than the T1D group (18.42 ± 3.45 s vs 20.25 ± 3.84 s, (135) = -2.940, p<0.01) and reported a higher SP than the T1D group (6.02 ± 1.41 W/kg vs 5.33 W/ kg ± 1.20, (135) = 3.042, p<0.01]. When analysed by sex, the difference in the CST remained statistically significant only among females, with the CG performing faster than the T1D group (18.29 ± 3.55 s vs 20.50 ± 3.86 s; (65) = -2.617, p<0.05] and reporting a higher SP than the T1D group (6.29 ± 1.41 W/kg vs 5.51 ± 1.07 W/kg, (65) = 2.651, p<0.05]. No statis- tically significant differences were found between the T1D and CG groups for handgrip strength [ (135) = -0.974, p=0.332], maximum isometric force [ (135) = 0.759, p=0.449] and RFD [ (135) = 0.452, p=0.652].

**Conclusion:**
While overall isometric muscular strength and power remain comparable, T1D may selectively impact lower-limb isotonic contraction, particularly in females. It may be that T1D negatively influ- ence repetitive dynamic tasks, inducing higher fatigability linked with a higher decline in motor unit discharge frequency. Therefore, CST and SP may already suggest a significant decline in muscular function, even in individuals without neuropathy and/or other muscle complications. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms.

**Background and aims:**
The prevalence of DKA at the onset of T1D (stage 3) in children and adolescents has been 20-30% for years. Delayed diagnosis is associated with a higher rate of DKA. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with the prevalence of DKA at the onset of T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
All children and adolescents with T1D (CwD) onset in a large German diabetes centre in 2022-2023 were included in a retrospective analysis. Age, sex, family history of T1D, duration of symptoms, admission or emergency presentation and metabolic parameters on admission (pH, bicarbonate, HbA1c) were evaluated. In a standardised questionnaire, all parents were asked ret- rospectively to describe their prior knowledge of T1D and the processes (medical contact, medical recommendation, own suspicion of diabetes) leading up to presentation to the clinic. Differences in independent vari- ables were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test, and differences in prevalence were assessed using the ­Chi test.

**Results:**
Between 01/2022 and 12/2023, 218 CwD [41.7% female, age 8.5 (0.9-18) years, median (range)] were diagnosed with T1D. Of these, 26 (12%) had a first-degree relative (FDR) with T1D. DKA was diag- nosed in 96 of 218 CwD (44%); 134 CwD (61.5%) were admitted to hos- pital, with 96.2% having a suspected diagnosis of T1D. CwD presenting directly to hospital were more likely to have DKA than those admit- ted (47.9% vs. 33.1%, p=.012). HbA1c was higher in CwD with DKA than in those without [12.0% (7.3-16.8) vs. 11.1% (6.3-17.1), p=.003]. The prevalence of DKA was similar in children with and without FDR (p=.401). Parents of 180 children (82.6%) completed the questionnaire. CwD of parents with suspected diabetes were less likely to have DKA (36.4% vs 55.4%, p=.009). CwD without direct admission (n=20) had a lower pH [7.13 (6.8-7.41) vs. 7.35 (6.79-7.46), p=.002] and lower bicarbonate [10.5 mmol/L (4.9-23.8) vs. 21.4 mmol/L (4.8-31.8), p<.001.]. Parents’ prior knowledge of T1D from awareness campaigns using leaflets (n=7, 3.9% of parents) or posters (n=15, 8.3%) was low and not associated with their child’s DKA at onset (both p>0.1). Prior knowledge of T1D from the internet (n=28, 15.6%), social media (n=18, 10%) or television (n=25, 13.9%) was not associated with the rate of DKA (all p>0.1). Of note, the rate of DKA in children was similar in parents with (n=32, 18.1%) or without a medical background (p=.436).

**Conclusion:**
In 2022-2023, the prevalence of DKA at the onset of T1D was 44%, which is higher than in previous years. Having first- degree relatives with T1D did not protect against DKA at T1D onset in children and adolescents nor did having parents with a medical back- ground. Any delay in diagnosis of T1D was associated with imminent or established DKA. When families themselves suspected that their child had diabetes, DKA was less common. Parents’ general knowledge about T1D was low. Therefore, population-wide education campaigns and continuing education for healthcare professionals, or the introduc- tion of screening programmes to detect early-stage T1D, are needed to prevent DKA in children and adolescents.

2. of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland, Department of Dental Surgery,

**Background and aims:**
Excessive fat tissue accumulation and peri- odontal disease are associated with low-grade inflammation, microvas- cular dysfunction and pathology, and are both common features of type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycaemia-associated chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress are the main risk factors of chronic microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, other factors may also impact the risk. The study assessed the associations of selected fat tissue indices with periodontal inflammation in adults with T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
We included 299 participants with T1D (128 men), aged 29.3±8.3 years, disease duration 13 (IQR 8-19) years, HbA1c 8.2±1.7%, with body mass index (BMI) 24.0±3.7kg/m , 71 (24%) smoking cigarettes. The electrical bioimpedance was used to analyze fat tissue indices: visceral factor (VF), fat-to-muscle ratio (FMR), fat mass index (FMI, fat mass divided by height square, kg/ m ). Gingival index (GI) was used to assess periodontal inflammation. Statistical analysis performed with Dell Statistica v.13. included Spear- man correlation and multivariable regression. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

**Results:**
The median GI was 0.88 (IQR 0.63-1), with mild inflam- mation (GI<1.1) in 242 participants (81%), moderate inflammation (GI 1.1-2) in 57 (19%) participants, and severe inflammation (GI≥1.2) in none. GI correlated with age (r=0.12, p=0.03), HbA1c (r=0.16, p=0.006), BMI (r=0.22, p=0.00009), VF (r=0.24, p=0.00003), FMI (r=0.12, p=0.03). No correlation with FMR was found. In several multivariable regression analysis models adjusted for age, gender, HbA1c and smoking cigarettes, GI was associated with BMI (β=0.18, R2=0.09, p=0.00001), VF (β=0.2, R2=0.09, p=0.00001), FMI (β=0.2, R2=0.1, p=0.000007), FMR (β=0.2, R2=0.1, p=0.000009), respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Higher body fat content expressed by selected fat tissue indices is associated with periodontal inflammation in adults with T1D.

2. Universitario Reina Sofía, Córdoba, Spain, Facultad de Medicina.

**Background and aims:**
FIB-4 is a non-invasive index used to estimate liver fibrosis. There is limited data about type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to evaluate the relationship between FIB-4, glycemic control and insulin resistance.

**Materials and methods:**
Cross-sectional study of patients with T1DM from Spain. Demographic analytical data were collected. Dietary pat- tern and Diabetes Distress Screening scale (DDS) were evaluated. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical analy- ses included Spearman’s correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney and Pearson’s ² tests for categorical variables. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 29 (statistically significative p value < 0.05, trend towards statistical significance p value < 0.1).

**Results:**
204 patients included (52% women, 48% men; mean age of 40.90 ± 11.57 years). The mean duration of diabetes was 20.26 ± 10.74 years. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.36±4.48 kg/m . Mean HbA1c was 6.87% (± 0.77). Mean FIB-4 score was 0.84 ± 0.42 (85% FIB-4 < 1.3, 15% FIB-4 between 1.3-2.67 and 0% FIB-4 > 2.67). No correlation was found between FIB-4 score and HbA1c levels (p = 0.923). No correlation was found between FIB-4 and lipid profile (total cholesterol p=0.560; triglycerides p=0.799; HDL cholesterol p=0.116, and LDL cholesterol p=0.822). Patients treated with insulin and met- formin (19 patients; 9.3%) had significantly higher FIB-4 scores (p = 0.043). A weak but statistically significant correlation was observed between higher FIB-4 scores (> 1.3) and high BMI (rho = 0.255; p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences in FIB-4 scores were found regarding total insulin dose used (p = 0.234).A weak but statisti- cally significant correlation was observed between FIB-4 and time in hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dl) and time in range (rho = 0.19, p = 0.005; rho = 0.15, p = 0.028, respectively). No correlation was found between FIB-4 and coefficient of variation (CV) or time in hypoglycemia (<75 mg/dl).No statistically significant differences in FIB-4 scores were found among those following a portion-based diet (p = 0.413). How- ever, a trend toward statistical significance was observed in patients adhering to a Mediterranean dietary pattern (p = 0.074). Those with higher DDS scores had significantly higher FIB-4 scores (p = 0.001).A trend toward statistical significance was observed between FIB-4 and the presence of diabetic nephropathy (p = 0.086) and diabetic retinopa- thy (p = 0.098). Higher FIB-4 scores were significantly associated with previous acute decompensation in the form of diabetic ketoacidosis.

**Conclusion:**
In our cohort, higher FIB-4 scores were associated with chronic microvascular and acute complications. FIB-4 score was also linked to glycemic control. Patients with higher BMI and those treated with metformin had higher FIB-4 scores, likely related to the presence of insulin resistance.

2. versity, Linköping, Sweden, Department of Endocrinology, Linköping

**Background and aims:**
It remains uncertain whether patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have a higher risk of fractures, but most previ- ous studies suggest an increased susceptibility. Biomarkers have been researched in association to the risk of acquiring fractures but with varying results. One of these is copeptin and some studies suggest that this hormone may be involved in the increased risk of fractures among patients with T1D. Furthermore, it is known that patients vid T1D often have dyslipidemia, where some studies have shown that ApoB and ApoA1 could affect the risk of fracture. Finally, glucose control and by default HbA1c are connected to the risk of many complications associated with T1D, this may include the risk of fractures. The aim of this study is to find biomarkers to predict fractures in T1D patients..

**Materials and methods:**
This study is a populations-based prospective observational study. There were 1481 participants in total, 1105 were included since they left blood samples, among these, 586 participants had T1D. Fasting blood samples were collected at recruitment (2010- 2013). After 10 years information was gathered through the Swedish population register about fracture events during this time. Apolipo- protein A1 (ApoA1),Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), C-reactive protein (CRP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR, calculated using the CKD-EPI equation), Copeptin and HbA1c (only on participants with T1D) were analyzed.

**Results:**
A total of 118 fractures occurred, 80 of them among in the group with T1D (p<0.001). Univariate logistic regressions were per- formed on controls and patients separately for the risk of fracture in regard to age, smoking, gender, CRP, ApoA1, ApoB, HbA1c, GFR and copeptin respectively. In the control group smoking was a significant risk factor (OR 2.391, Cl 1.071-5.336, p=.033). In the patient group the risk of fracture increased with age (OR 1.058, Cl 1.028-1.088, p <.001), a higher ApoB (OR 5.465, Cl 1.696-17.613, p=.004), ApoA1 (OR 3.628, Cl 1.668-7.890, p=.001) and Copeptin (OR 1.026, Cl 1.005-1.048, p=.017.). The risk also increased with a lower GFR (OR .981, Cl .969-.993, p.001) among participants with T1D. To investigate these connections, we made multivariate logistic regressions. When adjusting for gender, smoking and age Copeptin remained significant (OR 1.022, Cl 1.000-1.044, p-value .048) in the patient group. Age was significant (OR 1.053, Cl 1.023-1.084, p<.001) with this model in the group only including patients. However, when adding CRP and GFR, copeptin was no longer significant. Smoking was significant in the control group (OR 2.479, Cl 1.105-5.562, p=.028). When adjust- ing for all the investigated variables (HbA1c, GFR, CRP, copeptin age, smoking and gender) both ApoA1 (OR 2.949, Cl 1.214-7.166, p-value .017) and ApoB (OR 4.471, Cl 1.167-17.138, p-value .029) remained significant in the patient group. Age was the only other significant vari- able (OR 1.052, Cl 1.015-1.091, p-value .006) in this model.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, among patients with T1D the risk of frac- ture increases with a higher ApoB and ApoA1, even when adjusting for other factors (gender, smoking, age, CRP, GFR, Copeptin, HbA1c). Higher Copeptin levels also increases the risk for fractures, even when adjusting for age, smoking and gender.

**Background and aims:**
People with type 1 diabetes (PwT1D) are at higher risk of developing periodontal diseases. We investigated the impact of dietary habits on the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) micro- biome and metabolome in PwT1D.

**Materials and methods:**
PwT1D were recruited and matched with non-diabetic controls. The oral and periodontal examination was per- formed and GCF sampled. Genomic DNA was extracted, bacterial 16S rRNA sequenced and concentrations of short-chain fatty acids and trimethylamine derivatives determined. Pro-healthy (pHDI) and non-healthy diet indices (nHDI) were calculated using the validated Questionnaire of Eating Behaviours.

**Results:**
In total, 110 participants were included (mean age 27.1±6.0 years, 60.0% male). In 65 PwT1D, the mean duration of diabetes was 15.5±8.4 years and mean Hba1c% 6.97 ± 0.95% (53±2.2 mmol/ mmol). 22 cases of mild gingivitis (G) were identified, all in the T1D group. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of pHDI categories between study groups (T1D with G, low 19 [86.4%] and moderate 3 [13.6%]; T1D without G, low 28 [66.7%] and moderate 14 [45.2%]; control, low 30 [68.2%], moderate 14 [31.8%]; p=0.213). GCF microbiome composition did not differ between pHDI categories. Gingivitis was the only statistically significant contributor to the vari- ance in the composition of microbiome (Figure 1). The total muscle mass was significantly associated with microbial richness (Chao index, r=-0.25, p-value =0.016). In PwT1D and G, caproic acid was higher in low vs. moderate pHDI category (3.5 [0.9-4.9] vs. 0.64 [0.49-NA] umol/l, p=0.04). In people with T1D without G, isocaproic acid and glycerophosphorylcholine were lower in low vs. moderate pHDI cate- gory (0.14 [0.13-0.46] vs. 0.45 [0.18-1.24] umol/l, p=0.032, and 71.23 [32.83-120.40] vs. 129.8 [70.5-228.1] ng/ml, p=0.013).

**Conclusion:**
This was the first study to report on the impact of diet on GCF in PwT1D. The state of periodontal tissues was worse in people with T1D, overweight and with a worse quality diet. Although the impact of diet itself on the GCF microbiome was not significant, there were alterations in the concentrations of selected GCF metabolites. This suggests an indirect association between the quality of diet and contents of pro-healthy and non-healthy products on the state of periodontium.

**Pedal acceleration time is a suitable test to detect peripheral circu- latory disorders in diabetic patients**

P. Pithová

**Background and aims:**
Detection of peripheral circulatory disorders of the lower extremities is an important part of the examination in dia- betic patients. Currently, in addition to duplex sonography of peripheral arteries (DUS), ankle brachial index (ABI), toe brachial index (TBI) and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcpO2) measurements are avail- able. Due to the presence of mediocalcinosis, ABI examination is not reliable and TBI and tcPO2 measurements are not widely available. Therefore, other methods suitable for detecting peripheral circulatory disorders that are more accessible are being sought. Currently, the method tested in this way is the evaluation of pedal acceleration times (PAT) on plantar arteries using DUS. Our aim was to compare ABI and TBI values ​with PAT examination in type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) diabetic patients.

**Materials and methods:**
113 patients (29 T1DM patients, 67 men), mean age 64.5 ± 13.1 years, mean diabetes duration 20.7 ± 13.3 years, were examined. Active diabetic ulceration was present in 49 % of patients. We examined 221 limbs (5 patients were after unilateral major limb amputation), 39 limbs had been revascularized in the past. We determined ABI and TBI values ​using a photoplethysmographic device. We determined pedal acceleration time in both plantar arteries using duplex ultrasound.

**Results:**
PAT value were significantly negatively correlated with TBI (r= -0.82, p=0.001), but not with ABI (r= -0.18, p=0.928) regardless of diabetes type. PAT values ​changed unfavourably with age and dura- tion of diabetes, identically to changes in TBI values, but only in type 2 diabetes patients. In limbs underwent revascularization procedures, PAT values ​were significantly higher and TBI significantly lower than in limbs without a history of revascularization.

**Conclusion:**
Examination of pedal acceleration times made by duplex ultrasound at plantar arteries may be an easily available alternative method to determine circulatory disorders in the lower limbs in dia- betic patients, and it is completely comparable to measurement of toe brachial indexes.

**Intensive weight loss intervention and cancer mortality in adults with type 2 diabetes: analysis of the Look AHEAD randomised trial**

H.-C. Yeh

**Background and aims:**
Although excess weight is linked to increased cancer mortality, evidence is limited on whether intentional weight loss can reduce cancer deaths. Look AHEAD was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that recruited individuals with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) across the US. Because patients with T2D have elevated risk for several types of cancer, Look AHEAD provided a unique opportunity to study cancer outcomes in a high-risk population. We conducted intent-to-treat analyses to determine whether intensive lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss lowers total and obesity- related cancer mortality. In a secondary exploratory analysis, we com- pared obesity-related cancer mortality by magnitude of weight loss in one year. To our knowledge, Look AHEAD is the only RCT examining weight loss on long-term cancer outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
Participants were randomly assigned to Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) or Diabetes Support and Educa- tion (DSE). The ILI was designed to achieve and maintain weight loss by facilitating reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity. For the DSE comparison group, three yearly sessions on diet, exercise, and social support were held during years 1-4, then reduced to one ses- sion/year in later years. Cancer deaths were adjudicated by study physi- cians based on death certificates, hospital records, autopsy reports, and/ or informant interviews. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios comparing the ILI group with the DSE group.

**Results:**
Among 4,901 participants (baseline mean [SD] age, 58.9 [6.8] years; 59% women; 16% Black participants; 66% White participants; BMI mean [SD] 36 [5.9] kg/m2; diabetes duration median 5 years: 15% insulin use), there were 1092 deaths over a median follow-up of 16.7 years. Cancer was the leading cause of death: 155 in ILI and 172 in DSE died from cancer. The mortality rates of obesity-related cancers were 1.9 and 2.3 per 1,000 person-years in ILI and DSE, respectively, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60- 1.13). Associations were similar in men (HR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.47-1.23)) and in women (HR 0.87 (95% CI: 0.57-1.33)). ILI participants who lost >=15%, >=10% to <15%, >=5% to <10%, >=2% to <5%, and <2% or weight gain in one year did not have significant differences on obesity-related cancer mortality: HRs (95% CI) were 1.36 (0.81-2.27), 1.17 (0.73-1.88), 0.61 (0.34 - 1.08), 0.79 (0.40-1.53), and 0.53 (0.21- 1.31), respectively, as compared to DSE after adjustments for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking history, and baseline weight.

**Conclusion:**
An intensive lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss lowered mortality of obesity-related cancers by 17% in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes. The study sample size likely lacked power to determine effect sizes of this magnitude and smaller. Look AHEAD did not find an association between larger weight loss in one year and further reductions in obesity-related cancer deaths.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is closely associated with pancreatic tumors, with 60-70% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PaC) patients presenting with DM. However, this association is less pronounced in other pancreatic tumors, such as ampullary carcinoma (AC), where diabetes prevalence ranges from 10-20%, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), where it is estimated at 15-30%. The underlying mechanisms linking glucose metabolism dysfunction to dif- ferent pancreatic neoplasms remain unclear. This study aimed to evalu- ate differences in metabolic state and β-cell function among patients with different pancreatic tumors.

**Materials and methods:**
We evaluated 258 subjects, divided as fol- lows: 169 with PaC, 49 with AC, and 40 with NETs. All patients under- went a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a hypergly- cemic clamp (HC). β-cell functional parameters were calculated by C-peptide deconvolution. From OGTT were derived glucose sensitivity (GS), representing the ability of β-cell to respond to incremental glu- cose levels, and the AUC of glucose, insulin and C-peptide. Absolute and incremental 1st phase insulin secretion (ISR1abs and ISR1inc) were derived from HC.

**Results:**
Among PaC patients, 43 (25.4%) had a prior diagnosis of diabetes, compared to 7 (14.3%) in the AC group and 7 (17.5%) in the NET group. However, OGTT screening revealed an additional 21 (24.7%) PaC patients with undiagnosed diabetes and 28 (32.9%) with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), compared to 6 (18.8%) with DM and 10 (31.3%) with IGT in the AC group, and 1 (4%) with DM and 9 (36%) with IGT in the NETs group. Notably, glucose tolerance sta- tus did not correlate with tumor grade in any of the tumor subtypes (p=0.285).Metabolic assessments showed that PaC patients had sig- nificantly higher glucose levels at 120 minutes during OGTT (p<0.001) compared to NETs patients, as well as increased mean glucose levels (OGTT AUC) compared to both NETs (p=0.002) and AC (p=0.03) patients. While no significant differences were observed in absolute total insulin secretion during OGTT - assessed through AUC of insulin (p=0.48) and AUC of C-peptide (p=0.07) - PaC patients exhibited sig- nificantly reduced β-cell function, with lower GS (p=0.009), ISR1inc (p=0.01), and ISR1abs (p=0.014) compared to AC patients.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings highlight distinct metabolic profiles among different pancreatic tumors. Up to 80% of PaC patients exhibit altered glucose metabolism, followed by 64% of AC patients and 48% of NET patients. This may explain the higher glycemic values observed in the PaC group. These results suggest that the metabolic impact of PaC differs from that of NET and AC, with a more pronounced β-cell dys- function in PaC, which may contribute to the higher prevalence of diabetes in this population.

**Background and aims:**
Earlier studies suggested that people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have an increased risk of obesity-related (OR) can- cers, including cancer of the breast, uterus, ovary, and gastrointestinal cancers. We reported increased skin autofluorescence (SAF) in certain subtypes of cancers. In the Lifelines population-based study, we aimed to assess the association between body adiposity, the presence of meta- bolic syndrome (MetS) and the incidence of OR and non-OR cancer in participants with and without T2D. We also tested the association of SAF with both cancer groups.

**Materials and methods:**
Initial participant screening was performed from 2006 to 2013. Detailed pathology follow-up data were obtained from the Dutch Nationwide Pathology Databank (linkage date March 2023). OR cancer was defined according to Mahamat-Saleh et al, 2024. Adiposity was assessed by calculating body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage (BF%), the latter with the Clínica Universidad de Navarra-Body Adiposity Estimator. T2D was self-reported, based on use of blood-glucose-lowering medication, or a new diagnosis (fast- ing blood glucose ≥7.0 mmol/l or HbA1c≥6.5%) at initial Lifelines screening.

**Results:**
In total, 78,160 adult Lifelines participants free of cancer at baseline (42% males, mean age 43±12 yrs) were followed for a median of 11.5 years. The cumulative incidence of cancer was 6.9% in people without T2D (n=75,678, mean HbA1c 5.5±0.3%) and 12.8% in people with T2D (n=2283, mean HbA1c 6.8±1.1%). Overall, 46% of incident cancer cases were OR cancers; 80% of the participants with OR cancer were women, which was almost entirely explained by breast cancer incidence. Cox Proportional Hazard analysis showed that age was the most impor- tant predictor of cancer. In addition, higher BMI and higher BF%, and pack-years of smoking were most strongly associated with OR can- cer, while age, presence of MetS, and smoking were most strongly related to non-OR cancers. When adjusted for age, higher BF% was a much stronger predictor for OR cancer than BMI (HR 1.05, 95%CI 1.04-1.05, P<0.0001 vs HR 1.01, 95%CI 1.00-1.01, p=0.04); also, the presence of T2D was associated with a 14% higher hazard of non-OR cancer (p=0.001), but no higher risk of OR cancer. Increased SAF (age- adjusted) was associated with both OR and non-OR cancer (HR 1.23 vs 1.20, both p<0.0001). After additional adjustment for smoking, the association of SAF with non-OR cancer became borderline significant (HR 1.10, 95%CI 1.00-1.20, p=0.05). There was a curvilinear relation- ship between SAF score and pack-years of smoking for the 12 most frequent cancer types.

**Conclusion:**
In this population-based study, we observed that body fat percentage is more strongly associated with the incidence of OR cancer than BMI, and we did not observe an increased hazard of OR cancer in people with T2D. MetS plays a role in the development of non-OR cancers, which is possibly related to smoking. The association of increased SAF with incident cancer is in part mediated by smoking.

3. Edmonton, AB, Canada, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.

**Background and aims:**
To determine the extent to which diet and lifestyle factors provide additional prognostic value regarding the asso- ciation between diabetes and cancer.

**Materials and methods:**
The study included participants with no history of cancer, enrolled between 2000-2009, in the population- based Alberta’s Tomorrow Project in Alberta, Canada. Information on diet and lifestyle factors including physical activity (hours per day spent sitting and walking), diet [number of alcoholic drinks, servings of fruits, vegetables, and meat, and diet quality via healthy eating index (HEI)], smoking status; and body mass index were collected at baseline using standardized questionnaires. Incidence of diabetes and cancer were determined via linkage with health administrative databases and the Alberta Cancer Registry data. Follow-up data were available until March 31, 2021. The association between diabetes and cancer incidence, before and after accounting for age, sex, comorbid- ity burden (as measured by Elixhauser Comorbidity Index), and diet/ lifestyle factors was examined using Cox proportional hazard models.

**Results:**
Among 28,106 participants, 1,494 had prevalent diabetes, while over a mean (±SD) follow-up of 15.1±4.0 years, 2,747 had incident diabetes, and 3,180 had incident non-melanoma cancers. Among all participants, the incidence rate ratio [and 95% CI] of cancer among those with and without diabetes was 1.39 (1.26, 1.54). The association between diet/lifestyle factors and cancer risk was similar among those with and without diabetes (no significant inter- action). Compared to participants with a low HEI, participants with medium and high HEI had a 12% and 16% reduction in cancer risk, respectively (Figure). Participants reporting the highest number of servings of vegetables and fruits (Q4) had lower cancer risk com- pared to those with those reporting lowest number of servings (Q1). Being physically active, including walking, was associated with lower cancer risk, while being sedentary and sitting was associated with a higher risk of cancer. Relative to normal/underweight, there was a trend towards obesity being associated with a 10% higher risk of cancer (p=0.053). Smoking was associated with a 24% higher risk of cancer incidence. In models adjusting for age, sex, comorbid- ity burden, and individual diet/lifestyle factors, diabetes continued to be associated with a significant 15-17% higher hazard for cancer.

**Conclusion:**
Diet/lifestyle factors may impact cancer risk in peo- ple with and without diabetes. However, diabetes is associated with a ~20% residual risk for cancer, even after accounting for demo- graphic, comorbidity, and diet/lifestyle factors.

5. Denmark, Novo Nordisk, Søborg, Denmark, University of Southern

**Background and aims:**
Several glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) labels include black box warnings for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) based on rodent data. Recently a potential link between GLP-1 RA use and thyroid cancer (TC) has been suggested in observational studies and clinical trial meta-analyses. The current anal- ysis aimed to evaluate whether GLP-1 RA use indicates an increased TC risk in humans, using complementary data sources.

**Materials and methods:**
Clinical trial and postmarketing cases were identified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities V27.1 ‘High-level term thyroid neoplasm malignant’. TC incidence and exposure-adjusted incidence rates between GLP-1 RA, placebo or comparator groups were compared for 91 phase 2-3 completed, ran- domised, controlled GLP-1 RA clinical trials (including large, long- term cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs)). Cases from clinical trials and post-marketing data within a safety database underwent a detailed medical assessment. An observational new-user cohort was created for target (GLP1 RA) and comparator Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) drug exposure in Merative™ MarketScan® Com- mercial Database. A 1:2 propensity score matching was performed. Cox-proportional hazard ratio (HR) was estimated with 6 months latency period.

**Results:**
Pooled clinical trial data (102,199 participants reporting 59 TC cases) indicates no incidence rate imbalance between treatment arms (GLP-1 RA: 0.04, Placebo: 0.02 Comparator: 0.03 events/100 patient-years of exposure (PYE)). The CVOTs (>46,000 participants) reported 34 TC cases with no overall rate imbalance between treatment arms (GLP-1 RA: 0.03, Placebo: 0.02 events/100 PYE). Most cases reported for both arms were of the papillary subtype and identified in individuals aged >40 years with elevated BMI, reflecting expected epidemiological patterns. Most cases reported relevant confounding information including a medical history of thyroid disease. Similarly, there was no imbalance for the MTC subtype observed between treat- ment groups from pooled clinical study (GLP-1 RA: 0.003, Placebo: 0.005, Comparator: 0.00 events per 100 PYE) data or CVOTs (GLP1-1 RA: 0.003, Placebo: 0.004 events/100 PYE). The GLP-1 RA post- marketing exposure is >27,000,000 PYE, with a low TC reporting rate of 0.001 cases/100 PYE. A comprehensive medical assessment did not support a causal relationship with GLP-1 RA use in most cases. Median follow-up for MarketScan® data was 688 days for GLP-1 RA- treated participants, and 639 days for SGLT-2i-treated participants. The survival probability for patients free from TC was comparable over the follow-up period. There was no elevated risk of TC for GLP-1 RA- versus SGLT-2i-treated participants (HR: 0.87 [0.58-1.29]).

**Conclusion:**
The totality of evidence provides reassurance on the short to intermediate-term safety of GLP-1 RA use on TC, however studies (such as registry studies) with longer follow-up and data on TC sub- types are needed.

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the most common cause of chronic liver disease, with higher prevalence in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and obesity, and has a bi-directional relationship with T2D. MASLD is a complex phenotype and unexplained chronically elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a good proxy. People of South-Asian ethnicity have been under-represented in all areas of MASLD, and we hypothesised that there are novel genetic variants that account for phenotypic differences.

**Materials and methods:**
Genes and Health (G&H) is one of the larg- est community-based genetic studies in UK involving British Bangla- deshi and Pakistani participants with genetic and linked longitudinal healthcare records. Our cALT phenotype was based on a multi-ancestry GWAS study in the Million Veteran Program (MVP). Mean age (stand- ard deviation (SD)) was 46.1 (12.7) years in cALT and 40.3. (13.7) in controls. In the cALT group, 50.4% were females and in the controls, 41.2% were females. We performed genome-wide (GWAS), replicated loci and performed a polygenic risk score (PRS).

**Results:**
Binary GWAS of cALT (6384) vs controls (26937) identified 11 variants that achieved genome wide (5E-8) or nominal significance (1E-6). Of these, 2 were classified as novel (rs78156005( : 4.5E-08) and rs58395847( : 9.2E-07). rs78156005 is intronic and in linkage disequilibrium with . In silico analysis using the FUMA platform revealed that rs78156005 affected the expression and was also in chromatin contact with , suggesting this to be an important regulatory region. Of the 23 variants that achieved 11 were replicated in the MVP cALT cohort and 5 in the UK Biobank NAFLD cohort. While rs58395847 did replicate, rs78156005 was confined to the South Asian cohort. Restricted PRS using 13 variants from G&H cohort performed bet- ter (R2 - 5.42%) than PRS from MVP cohort using 40 variants (R2 - 4.44%) or 70 variants (R2 - 5.16%). Compared with controls, the cALT group was associated with a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions - MASLD (odds ratio [OR] 6.6; 95% CI, 6.2-7.2), type 2 diabetes (OR 4; 95% CI, 3.8, 4.2), obesity (OR 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.7), hypertension (OR 3; 95% CI, 2.8, 3.1), cardiovascular disease (OR 2.3; 95% CI, 2.2-2.5), chronic kidney disease (OR 2; 95% CI, 1.8-2.2) and mortality (OR 2.3; 95% CI, 2-2.6).

**Conclusion:**
We identified 2 novel variants ( and ) in the largest GWAS of cALT in people of South Asian ancestry, of these only was replicated in the externals cohorts. rs78156005 ( was confined to the South Asian cohort and may be in an important regulatory region Our cALT group was associated with higher odds of cardiometabolic conditions. Further analysis to under- stand the population-specificity and mechanistic significance of these loci, and clinical utility of our PRS is needed.

**Background and aims:**
Increased glucose levels and dyslipidemia, as well as oxidative and inflammatory stress, are characteristic for dia- betes, contributing to its complications, including fatty liver disease and accelerated atherosclerosis. Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) is known to be involved in the defense against oxidative and inflammatory stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. It was shown that the level of PON2 is decreased under pro-diabetic conditions. The aim of the present study was to set up a method to activate the transcription of endogenous PON2 by using CRISPR/dCas9 gene editing in cultured hepatocytes and in apolipoprotein E deficient ­(apoE ) mice, to reduce the deleterious effects of pro-diabetic conditions.

**Materials and methods:**
Human hepatocytes (Hep) from Huh7 line were transfected using commercially available CRISPR activation plas- mids for PON2 or control plasmids (Cp), and exposed or not to glucoli- potoxic conditions (GLC) (250 μM palmitic acid plus 25mM glucose) and pro-inflammatory TNFα. The levels of PON2 and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) were measured in transfected Hep exposed or not to GLC or TNFα. The antioxidant and anti-inflamma- tory effect of the conditioned media (CM) from transfected Hep on GLC or TNFα-activated endothelial cells (ECs from EA.hy926 line) was evaluated. In addition, the CRISPR/dCas9 activation plasmids for PON2 or Cp plus a jetPEI transfection reagent were injected by tail vein in ­apoE male mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) and maintained for four weeks. Then the animals were euthanized, and PON2 expression and glutathione (GSH) levels were quantified in the collected livers and blood.

**Results:**
Transcriptional activation of PON2 in Hep resulted in: (i) increased levels of the target protein (2-fold, p<0.01) and (ii) decreased levels of mtROS in the transfected Hep exposed to GLC or TNFα (30- 40%, p<0.05). The CM from PON2-transfected Hep exerted protective effects on ECs exposed to GLC or TNFα as follows: (a) it increased the anti-oxidant defense of ECs by up-regulating the endothelial PON2 expression (80 % in GLC, p<0.001, and 40% in TNFα- exposed cells, p<0.05) and superoxide dismutase 1 (40%, p<0.05 for both condi- tions); (b) reduced total intracellular ROS (20%, p<0.05): (c) decreased the level of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (30 %, p<0.05 for both conditions), and reduced the monocyte adhesion to ECs (20% for GLC exposure, p<0.01 and 10% for TNFα exposure, p<0.05). tran- scriptional activation of PON2 increases its gene expression in the liver (2-fold, p<0.01) and augments blood GSH levels (25%, p<0.05), despite of lipotoxic conditions due to HFD (total cholesterol 848 ± 25 mg/dl).

**Conclusion:**
Transcriptional activation of PON2 using CRISPR/ dCas9 system could be a promising therapeutic approach to preserve the proper function of hepatocytes and endothelial cells exposed to pro-diabetic conditions.

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic (CKM) syndrome is a newly proposed systemic condition that encompasses metabolic dysfunction, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovas- cular diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD). While this concept is based on the evidence that hepatic steatosis plays a key role in pathogenesis, the existence of metabolic dysfunction-associated stea- totic liver disease (MASLD) is not considered in the original staging for predicting cardiovascular events including CAD.

**Materials and methods:**
This study aimed to evaluate whether incorporating MASLD into an original CKM health stage classifica- tion improves the prediction of the risk of CAD in Japanese general population who underwent annual health checkups. A total of 18,358 participants were categorized into original CKM health stages (Stages 0-3) and the modified CKM health stages that include MASLD to ana- lyze their predictive ability for CAD. The incidence of CAD over a 10-year follow-up was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. Machine learning analyses were conducted to evaluate the contribution of factors to CAD incidence.

**Results:**
Compared to the original CKM health stage, the modified classification more effectively stratified the risk of CAD (Log-lank, p<0.001). Especially, the presence of MASLD alone (Stage 2) and MASLD with CKD (Stage 3) were significantly associated with higher CAD incidence (Stage 2: hazard ratio [HR] 1.57; Stage 3: HR 2.56; both p<0.05). Risk discrimination also significantly improved in the modified classification evaluated by Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI=0.092, p=0.001) and Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI=0.001, p=0.005). Furthermore, machine learning analyses using Random Forest and XGBoost feature importance identified MASLD as one of the major predictors of the onset of CAD, with a high Shap- ley Additive explanations (SHAP) value indicating its stronger model contribution.

**Conclusion:**
In accordance with the concept of CKM syndrome, the modified CKM health stage classification incorporating MASLD has improved the accuracy of predicting new onset of CAD in Japanese general population.

**Plasma proteomic profiling identifies biomarkers for prediction of cognitive impairments in type 2 diabetes**

Y. Bi

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes-associated cognitive impairment has emerged as a crucial complication threatening the life quality of diabetes patients. To facilitate early diagnosis for prognosis improve- ment, prognosis-associated biomarkers should be developed. This study aimed to identify highly important proteins as biomarkers for high-risk population screening and offer insights into the disease mechanism of diabetes-associated cognitive impairment.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included 2,723 participants with proteomic profiles and baseline type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank (UKB), of whom 354 developed cognitive impairment during the follow-up. Prognosis-associated proteins were identified with Cox regression and prioritized with sequential forward selection. Func- tional perspectives of potent biomarkers were generated with enrich- ment analysis, colocalization analysis and correlation analysis. With the prognosis-associated proteins, a proteome-based risk score was developed with Logistic regression to facilitate clinical application. The above analyses were repetitively applied to a non-diabetic population to evaluate the specificity of these biomarkers in the diabetic population.

**Results:**
Of all 2,923 proteins profiled, 143 proteins were identified to be significantly associated with diabetes-associated cognitive impair- ment after adjusted by confounding factors (age, sex, education levels). Functional annotation of these proteins revealed significant enrichment in neuron projection development, extracellular matrix organization, and alpha-amino acid metabolic processes. Further, sequential-forward selection with LightGBM identified 15 high-importance protein bio- markers for the identification of diabetes-associated cognitive impair- ment. Colocalization analysis revealed that these high-importance protein biomarkers were enriched in the hippocampus, cingulate, and prefrontal cortex, and were enriched in astrocytes, ependymal cells, and neurons. For further application, a proteome-based risk score com- bining the levels of these proteins with population characteristics and cognitive tests achieved the highest prediction power, with an AUC of 0.82±0.06. Specificity analysis revealed that 11 of all 15 high-impor- tance proteins were specifically associated with cognitive impairment in the diabetic population.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings provided insights into the distinct molecu- lar patterns of type 2 diabetes-associated cognitive impairments, and revealed promising biomarkers predicting cognitive impairments for diagnostic settings and risk stratification.

**Identification of CYP27A1 and 27-hydroxycholesterol as indicated targets for mild cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes**

T. Niu

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a signif- icant risk factor for cognitive impairment, with abnormal cholesterol metabolism contributing to dementia. 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) converts cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), which can cross the blood-brain barrier and is linked to cognitive dysfunc- tion. This study aimed to identify and validate marker genes for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with T2DM, focusing on the role of lipid disorders in the development of cognitive impairment.

**Materials and methods:**
Using quantitative transcriptome sequenc- ing, differentially expressed genes were identified from the hip- pocampal tissues of T2DM mouse model and those with normal glucose tolerance. Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated genes were identified using the GEO database. Overlapping genes were sub- jected to GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Specific genes were identified using LASSO logistic regression, random for- est and, SVM-RFE algorithms. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure 27-OHC and CYP27A1 concentra- tions. Multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression, and ROC curve analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between the key gene and cognitive function in T2DM patients.

**Results:**
Forty-nine overlapping genes between T2DM and AD were identified, with enrichment analyses highlighting their involvement in cholesterol and extracellular matrix metabolism. The marker gene 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) was identified for both diseases using three regression algorithms. Clinical validation in 112 T2DM patients without MCI (Non-MCI group) and 94 T2DM patients with MCI (MCI group) revealed a significant upregulation of CYP27A1 and 27-OHC in plasma in the MCI group (P < 0.001). Elevated plasma 27-OHC levels were negatively associated with MoCA and MMSE scores (overall cognitive function), CDT and AVLT-IR/DR scores (visual-spatial and memory function), and positively corre- lated with TMTB scores (executive function). Higher 27-OHC levels were associated with increased LDL, non-HDL, LDL/HDL, total/ HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (P < 0.05) and decreased HDL cholesterol (P < 0.001). Elevated plasma CYP27A1 and 27-OHC were identified as independent risk factors for MCI in T2DM patients (OR = 1.257, P = 0.015; OR = 1.024, P < 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
High plasma levels of 27-OHC may indicate an increased risk of developing early cognitive impairment, including deficits in attention, executive function, memory, and visual-spatial abilities, in patients with T2DM. Adverse lipid profiles are associated with elevated 27-OHC levels. These findings suggest that 27-OHC has potential clinical significance as a biomarker for the early diag- nosis and treatment of MCI in T2DM patients. Identifying and vali- dating dysregulated marker genes in both T2DM and AD provides valuable insights into the intrinsic association between these condi- tions and offers new directions for managing and treating cognitive impairment associated with diabetes.

**Atorvastatin modulates lipid profile, glucose transporters, and neu- ronal markers in the brain of diabetic mice: insights into potential neuroprotective role**

R. Junges Moreira, moto, U. Fabres Machado, L. Giorgetti de Britto

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and vascular compli- cations, all contributing to an increased risk of cognitive decline. Dis- ruptions in brain glucose supply and lipid homeostasis play a crucial role in neuronal dysfunction and Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Statins, widely used for lipid regulation, have been associated with up to a 70% reduction in Alzheimer’s disease risk. This study investigates atorvastatin’s effects on lipid profiles, glucose transporter expression, and neuronal function markers in the cortex and hippocampus of T2D mice, providing insights into its potential neuroprotective role.

**Materials and methods:**
Five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for six weeks. Subsequently, streptozotocin (STZ; two doses of 75 mg/kg body weight, administered eight days apart) was injected, and the HFD was maintained. Control mice received a standard diet and were injected with citrate buffer (same volume). Ten days after the final STZ injection, glycemia was measured, and only mice with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL were classified as diabetic (DM). Diabetic animals were divided into two subgroups: untreated diabetes (DM) and diabetes treated with atorvastatin (DM+ATV; 0.1% wt/wt in HFD). After 24 weeks of diabetes, mice were euthanized, and brains were collected. The cortex was analyzed using gas chromatogra- phy (GC) and RT-qPCR, while the hippocampus was used for mRNA analysis. Gene expression of Slc2a1, Slc2a3, Slc2a4, Slc2a5, Creb1, Syp, Syn1, Rbfox3, Tnf, Rela, and Nfkb1 was assessed.

**Results:**
The DM group exhibited a significant increase in fasting gly- cemia ( < 0.0001) and a decrease in plasma insulin levels ( < 0.0001) compared to controls across all time points (6, 12, and 24 weeks of diabetes). Atorvastatin treatment (DM+ATV) partially reversed most of these metabolic alterations. In the brain, DM+ATV mice showed a reduction in the relative abundance of fatty acids C16:0 ( < 0.05), C18:0 ( < 0.05), and C22:6 ω-3 ( < 0.05). In the cortex of DM+ATV mice, mRNA expression levels were upregulated for Slc2a1 ( < 0.05), Slc2a3 ( < 0.05), Slc2a4 ( < 0.05), Creb1 ( < 0.05), Ccl2 ( < 0.05), and Bax ( < 0.05), while Tnf expression was downregulated ( < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in the expression of other genes analyzed. In the hippocampus of DM mice, a significant downregulation was observed for Slc2a3 ( < 0.05), Slc2a4 ( < 0.05), Slc2a5 ( < 0.05), Creb1 ( < 0.05), Syp ( < 0.05), Syn1 ( < 0.01), and Tnf ( < 0.05). Atorvastatin treatment restored Slc2a4 expression ( < 0.05 versus DM).

**Conclusion:**
Our findings indicate that atorvastatin benefits metabolic and neuronal parameters in a T2D mouse model. The treatment par- tially reversed hyperglycemia-induced alterations, modulated brain lipid composition, and restored key glucose transporter and neuronal function markers in the cortex and hippocampus. These results suggest atorvastatin’s potential neuroprotective role in T2D-associated brain dysfunction, possibly through lipid homeostasis and glucose metabo- lism regulation. Further studies are needed to explore its translational relevance and therapeutic potential in preventing cognitive decline in diabetes.

**Sterol regulatory element binding protein cleavage activating pro- tein promotes diabetic neuroinflammation and cognitive impair- ment via upregulation of lipocalin-2**

K. Liu, T. ­Niu, S. ­Wang

1. School of Medicine of Southeast University, NanJing, China, Depart-

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic patients exhibit increased levels of circulating inflammatory mediators, which are associated with neuroinflammation and potential mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-acti- vating protein (SCAP), a cholesterol sensor and chaperone for sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), plays a role in lipid metabolism. However, the exact function of SCAP in the diabetic brain remains unclear.

**Materials and methods:**
A diabetic mouse model was established using male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks. Astrocyte- specific SCAP knockout mice were generated via the Cre-loxP system to investigate the role of SCAP in HFD-induced diabetic mice. For in vitro experiments, primary microglia and BV2 cells were treated with high glucose (HG) combined with recombinant lipocalin-2 (rLCN2) to assess the effect of LCN2 on microglial polarization. Additionally, an astrocyte-microglia co-culture system using transwell chambers was established to evaluate the impact of astrocytic SCAP or LCN2 knockdown on microglial responses.

**Results:**
SCAP expression was upregulated in the hippocampal tissues of HFD-induced diabetic mice. Astrocyte-specific SCAP deletion ameliorated cognitive deficits and microglia-mediated neu- roinflammation in diabetic mice. Cut&Tag and molecular docking analyses revealed that astrocytic SCAP binds to the promoter region of Lcn2, thereby regulating LCN2 expression. Metabolomic profiling further suggested that LCN2 promotes microglial neuroinflammation via the mTOR pathway. In vitro co-culture experiments confirmed that astrocytic SCAP knockdown suppressed LCN2 secretion, sub- sequently alleviating HG-induced microglial neuroinflammation through the mTOR signaling pathway.

**Conclusion:**
These findings indicate that SCAP expression is closely linked to cognitive dysfunction in diabetic mice, with neuroinflam- matory activation exacerbating neuronal damage. SCAP regulates astrocyte-microglia crosstalk via the LCN2/24p3R/mTOR signaling axis, restoring cognitive function in diabetic mice.

**J-curve thresholds of Galectin-3 predict mild cognitive impair- ment in type 2 diabetes: a population-based stratification study**

X. Zhou

**Background and aims:**
Galectin-3 (Gal-3), implicated in neuroin- flammation and neurodegeneration, may serve as a key biomarker for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).This study investigates the potential correlation between plasma Gal-3 levels and MCI risk in T2DM, exploring its clinical predictive value.

**Materials and methods:**
The study enrolled 329 hospitalized T2DM patients (MCI group:144; NC group:185). Plasma Gal-3 levels were measured via ELISA. Cognitive function was assessed using MoCA, MMSE, and domain-specific neuropsychological tests. Statistical analyses included multivariable regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) models, and ROC curve analysis.

**Results:**
The subjects in MCI group exhibited significantly higher plasma Gal-3 levels than in NC group (P<0.001). Spearman analyses revealed strong inverse correlations between Gal-3 and cognitive scores (MoCA, MMSE, DST, VFT, CDT; all P<0.05), persisting after adjusting for confounders. Multivariable logistic regression identified Gal-3 as an independent MCI predictor (OR=2.79 per SD increase; P<0.001). RCS analysis demonstrated a J-shaped dose- response relationship between Gal-3 and MCI risk, with a threshold at 5.5 ng/mL (P<0.001). ROC analysis highlighted Gal-3’s superior predictive capacity (AUC=0.740, 95% CI:0.685-0.795), outperform- ing traditional risk factors.

**Conclusion:**
Elevated plasma Gal-3 is independently associated with cognitive decline in T2DM and demonstrates a nonlinear J-shaped relationship with MCI risk. Maintaining Gal-3 below 5.5 ng/mL may mitigate MCI progression. These findings position Gal-3 as a novel biomarker for early MCI detection and intervention in diabetic populations.

**Development and validation of a clinical prediction model based on plasma sTREM2 for mild cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes**

F. Liu

**Background and aims:**
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), an innate immune receptor predominantly expressed by CNS microglia and macrophages, exists in a soluble form (sTREM2) via proteolytic shedding or alternative splicing, detectable in biofluids such as CSF and plasma. Elevated CSF sTREM2 levels are implicated in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis. In T2DM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) significantly impacts quality of life, with a Japanese cohort study linking serum sTREM2 dynamics to longitudinal MMSE score changes (P<0.05). We aim to explore the association between plasma sTREM2 and T2DM-MCI and to develop a validated clinical nomogram integrating sTREM2 with key predictors.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included hospitalized patients with T2DM in China (November 2021-August 2024). Demographics, medical history, laboratory data, and cognitive assessments (MoCA, MMSE, DST, VFT, TMT-A/B, AVLT) were collected, with MCI diag- nosed via MoCA. Correlations between plasma sTREM2 levels and cognitive scores were analyzed, followed by a 7:3 data splitting (R v4.3.1). LASSO regression identified predictors in the training set, with subsequent logistic regression confirming MCI-associated factors. A nomogram-based scoring model was developed by integrating these findings with high-risk clinical variables. The model’s performance, including discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility, was rigor- ously assessed in the validation set.

**Results:**
The study included 215 T2DM patients (MCI=117, cogni- tively normal=98). In the overall cohort, plasma sTREM2 levels were significantly elevated in MCI (0.702 vs 0.496; P<0.001) and inversely correlated with MoCA (r = -0.193, P = 0.005) and DST scores (r = -0.183, P = 0.007). Following the 7:3 cohort splitting, LASSO regres- sion in the training set identified four predictors: sTREM2, neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR), body roundness index(BRI), and years of education. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of these variables demonstrated the following independent predictors of MCI: sTREM2 (OR = 3.898, 95% CI: 1.842-10.14, P = 0.002), NLR (OR = 1.528, 95% CI: 1.142-2.129, P = 0.007), BRI (OR = 1.586, 95% CI: 1.123- 2.334, P = 0.013), and years of education (OR = 0.783, 95% CI: 0.683- 0.883, P < 0.001). The nomogram integrating these four predictors demonstrated robust performance, with training and validation AUCs of 0.792 (95% CI: 0.721-0.864) and 0.787, respectively. Calibration was excellent (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.825), and decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC) confirmed clinical applicability.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings demonstrate that plasma sTREM2 levels are elevated in T2DM patients with MCI compared to cognitively normal T2DM patients. A validated nomogram integrating sTREM2, NLR, BRI, and years of education demonstrated good performance and clini- cal utility (as confirmed by DCA), enabling early MCI detection and timely intervention in T2DM.

**Age-related adaptations in methylglyoxal detoxification: insights from normoglycaemia and prediabetes**

M. Campos Campos, ­Szendroedi, T. ­Fleming

2. Germany, German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Helmholtz

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive dis- order characterized by insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and chronic hyperglycemia. Prediabetes, defined by impaired glucose regulation, reflects early metabolic disturbances that may drive T2D development. Beyond hyperglycemia, shifts in oxidative stress and intermediary metabolism contribute to disease progression. Meth- ylglyoxal (MG), a reactive glycolytic by-product, has been linked to insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction. Reduced activity of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1), the main MG-detoxifying enzyme, may exac- erbate these effects, although compensatory increases in aldo-keto reductase (Akr) activity have been proposed. However, the regulation of MG detoxification across different human metabolic states remains unclear. This study examined whether MG detoxification capacity differs between individuals with prediabetes and those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT).

**Materials and methods:**
We studied 72 individuals with either NGT (n=35; 31F/4M; age 31-71) or prediabetes (PRED; n=37; 17F/20M; age 30-83). Biochemical parameters included fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipids, and MG detoxification markers in red blood cells. Glo1 and Akr activity were measured spectrophotometrically; MG, D-lactate (Glo1 by-product), and hydroxyacetone (Akr by-product) were quantified by mass spectrometry. Group comparisons were performed using unpaired t-tests.

**Results:**
Compared to NGT, PRED individuals had significantly higher fasting glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, and AUC of glucose during oral glucose tolerance tests (p < 0.05). However, Glo1 and Akr activity, as well as MG levels, did not differ significantly between groups, though interindividual variability was high. Age emerged as a key determinant: Glo1 activity declined with age (NGT: r = -0.44, p < 0.01; PRED: r = -0.66, p < 0.0001), while Akr activity increased (NGT: r = 0.70, p < 0.0001; PRED: r = 0.81, p < 0.0001). Similar trends were seen for associated metabolites: D-lactate levels decreased (NGT: r = -0.56, p < 0.001; PRED: r = -0.69, p < 0.0001), while hydroxyacetone levels increased (NGT: r = 0.69, p < 0.0001; PRED: r = 0.74, p < 0.0001) with age in both groups. MG levels remained stable across age and glucose tolerance status. The age-dependent decline in Glo1 activity was more pronounced in PRED (-0.68) than NGT (-0.37), though not statistically significant.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings indicate that MG detoxification shifts from Glo1 to Akr pathways with aging, maintaining stable MG levels regard- less of glucose tolerance status. These compensatory enzymatic changes appear independent of prediabetes and may serve as a metabolic safe- guard against MG accumulation. Understanding age-related shifts in MG detoxification could provide novel insights into metabolic resilience and early diabetes risk modulation.

2. of China, Hefei, China, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of
3. Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, University of Dundee, Glencarse, UK.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a highly heterogeneous disease. A tree-like visualization model based on reversed graph-embedded dimensionality reduction in a Scottish population has revealed distinct sub- group-specific associations with complications and pathophysiology. However, the trans-ancestry applicability and progression patterns of these subgroups remain unclear. This study aimed to explore ethnicity-specific characteristics of T2D by applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-informed tree model, providing further insights into the underlying drivers of T2D heterogeneity.

**Materials and methods:**
We developed a Chinese-specific model using deep learning techniques in a large-scale, multi-center cohort comprising over 8.6 million individuals. In the first step, 32,501 Chinese individuals with newly diagnosed T2D were mapped onto the Scottish T2D tree to compare baseline clinical features and ten-year complication risks. In the second step, we constructed a Chinese-specific T2D tree using ten clinical variables identified via deep learning from 80% of the cohort and vali- dated it internally (20% of the cohort) and externally in two independent Chinese cohorts (n=1,006 and n=2,328, respectively).

**Results:**
Similar distribution between the Scottish and Chinese individu- als was observed in heart and kidney outcomes, but diabetic retinopathy varied across ancestries even within similar phenotypes. Using ten key clinical features unique to the Chinese population, we constructed and validated a Variational Autoencoder-informed tree model, which was fur- ther validated in two external cohorts, and revealed significant phenotypic shifts over ten years, toward higher-risk branches.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings emphasize the need for ancestry-specific approaches in T2D classification and demonstrate the utility of the Chi- nese tree model tool in advancing precision diabetology through individu- alized risk prediction and specialized treatment guidelines.

**Background and aims:**
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased steeply over recent decades. We aimed to examine how genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes has impacted this increase.

**Materials and methods:**
We used data from the population-based HUNT study in Norway, including observations from four surveys between 1984-86 and 2017-19, for participants aged 20-79 years. Diabetes was indicated by self-report, and additionally by non-fasting glucose or HbA1c. We used a polygenic score (PGS) for type 2 dia- betes including >1,100,000 genetic variants to approximate genetic susceptibility. We used generalized estimating equations to estimate diabetes prevalence for the top and bottom deciles of the PGS at each time point, allowing for three-way interaction between time, PGS cat- egory and 20-year age group. To explore underlying mechanisms, we performed similar analyses 1) for diabetes incidence by PGS category, 2) for 10-year mortality by diabetes status, and 3) using partitioned PGSs from clusters of genetic variants associated with different patho- physiological pathways involved in the development of type 2 diabetes.

**Results:**
The study included 198,312 observations from 86,194 indi- viduals. From 1984-86 to 2017-19, diabetes prevalence increased by 9.1 percentage points (pp, 95%CI 8.0-10.1) among the top decile of the PGS, 3.0 percentage points (95%CI 2.7-3.2) among the mid-80%, and 0.4pp (95%CI 0.1-0.7) among the bottom decile. The difference in diabetes prevalence between the top and bottom deciles of genetic susceptibility increased over time for all age groups, and also increased when using partitioned PGSs associated with insulin resistance and obesity as well as with beta cell dysfunction. Findings were similar when additionally using laboratory measurements to define hypergly- cemia. Additional analyses suggested an increasing diabetes incidence in young participants in the top decile of genetic susceptibility, and improved diabetes survival from 1996-2006 to 2007-2017.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings show an increasing gap in diabetes preva- lence between the most and least genetically susceptible, which may in part be explained by increasing incidence among young individu- als with a high genetic risk. This may imply that people with a high genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes are especially affected by a diabetogenic environment and highlights the need for public health measures.

**Depression increases both HbA testing frequency and risk of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes**

D. Handley, ­Lewis

1. Social, Genetic, and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King’s
2. College London, London, UK, University of Exeter, Exeter,
3. UK, Clinical and Biomedical Science, University of Exeter, Exeter,

**Background and aims:**
Frequent and consistent Glycated Haemo- globin (HbA1c) measurement is required for effective management of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Co-morbid depression is an important driver of poor health and mortality in individuals with T2D. While mechanisms linking depression to worse T2D outcomes have been described, few studies have examined how engagement with pri- mary care for T2D management differs in individuals with co-morbid depression, and how this impacts all-cause mortality.

**Materials and methods:**
Individuals with T2D in the Clinical Prac- tice Research Datalink Aurum dataset were identified, and glycaemic monitoring frequency was defined as the number of HbA1c meas- urements per year after diagnosis. Conway-Maxwell-Poisson mixed effects models were used to test the association of pre-existing and incident depression, depression severity and comorbidities with gly- caemic monitoring frequency. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine their association with all-cause mortality.

**Results:**
In total, 470,225 individuals with T2D were included in the analyses. In this cohort, 20.1% and 6.1% had pre-existing and incident depression, respectively. Being younger, male, and having a self-reported ancestry other than “white” were associated with lower glycaemic monitoring frequency, whereas higher deprivation, and pre-existing depression (IRR:1.06, CI: 1.05 - 1.07, p = 6.5x10 ), incident depression (IRR:1.04, CI: 1.03 - 1.05, p = 5.5x10 ) and an incident comorbidity score were associated with more frequent HbA1c testing. Pre-existing depression, incident depression, and recurrent depression were associated with higher all-cause mortality after adjusting for HbA1c testing frequency (Incident depression HR: 1.41, CI: 1.37 - 1.45, p = 3.7x10 ). In the entire cohort, increased HbA1c testing frequency was associated with reduced risk of all- cause mortality (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.92 - 0.94, p = 3.60x10 ).

**Conclusion:**
In T2D cases, those with a diagnosis of depression have more frequent glycaemic monitoring yet still face a higher risk of mortality. This suggests that interaction with primary care for T2D monitoring is not a driving factor for the increased mortality observed in this group. Other T2D management approaches, such as encouraging T2D medication adherence and adequate depression treatment, are necessary to reduce mortality in people with co-mor- bid depression and T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Monitoring and reducing the blood glucose control marker, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), is an important focus in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The extent to which early tight control (ETC) of glycaemic levels after diagnosis can positively impact microvascular (MiV) and macrovascular (MaV) outcomes requires further investigation. This study aims to use real-world data to deter- mine the relationship between ETC of HbA1c in patients with T2D and its long-term impact on the risk of developing MiV and MaV complications.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective, long-term, longitu- dinal study followed patients with newly diagnosed T2D between 2008-2019 using data from the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR), the National Patient Register (NPR), the Total Population Register, and the Cause of Death Register (CDR). At first NDR entry (index date), patients were ≥18 years, diagnosed with T2D within the same index year, had no prior history of MiV or MaV complications, and had HbA1c≥7%. After index, a 12-18 month glycaemic control assessment period monitored early HbA1c levels before patients were entered into the three cohorts: no early tight control (NETC; at least one HbA1c>6.5%), adverse control (AC; all HbA1c>7%), and ETC (all HbA1c≤6.5%). In the follow-up period, MiV and MaV outcomes were determined from the NDR and NPR, while cardiovascular (CV) deaths were ascertained from the CDR. Stratified Cox-proportional hazards models, with multiple cofound- ers, compared the rate of each complication across the cohorts and estimated Hazard ratios (HR).

**Results:**
At index date, the median age and sex of patients across all cohorts ranged from 56-58 years and 61-64% male, while 31-33% had no prior exposure to glucose-lowering medication. 14567, 8426, and 9793 patients were assigned to the NETC, AC, and ETC cohorts, respectively, with a median follow-up duration ranging from 3.6-4.4 years. ETC significantly reduced the rate of any MiV complication compared to the NETC or AC ( <0.0001 for all) cohorts, respec- tively (Figure 1). The rate of any MaV complication was also reduced with ETC compared to NETC ( <0.001) or AC ( <0.001) cohorts. ETC reduced the rate of CV death by 40% (HR=0.60; <0.001) com- pared to NETC and 48% (HR=0.52; <0.001) compared to the AC.

**Conclusion:**
This study found that patients with ETC of HbA1c had a significantly reduced rate of developing long-term complications compared to patients with NETC or AC. These findings present novel information on the long-term impact of HbA1c levels on clinical complications and reflect the importance of early intensive HbA1c management to improve the outcomes of patients with T2D. The long-term effects of HbA1c status after the 18-month assessment period were not captured in the scope of this study and require fur- ther exploration.

**Age-specific associations between blood pressure and cardiovas- cular disease, renal disease, and death among people with type 2 diabetes: a population-based cohort study**

E.W.K. Chow, E. Chow, J.C.N. Chan, A.O.Y. Luk

**Background and aims:**
Hypertension is an established cardiovascu- lar risk factor among people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but studies investigating the benefits of tight blood pressure control were gener- ally conducted in middle-aged or elderly individuals. We investigated age-specific associations between blood pressure and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), end- stage kidney disease (ESKD), and all-cause mortality among people with T2D using a real-world cohort.

**Materials and methods:**
We studied a territory-wide cohort of Chi- nese people with T2D who underwent diabetic complications screen- ing between 2001-2019 in Hong Kong. Seated office blood pressure was recorded by trained nurses. The primary outcomes were incident composite CVD, CKD, ESKD, and all-cause death. To study the age- specific association between blood pressure and study outcomes, we stratified participants into age groups at study entry (18-44 years, 45-59 years, 60-74 years, and above 75 years). In the primary analysis, we examined the non-linear association between study outcomes and blood pressure using restricted cubic splines (RCS), with systolic blood pres- sure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) expressed as continu- ous independent variables, stratified by age groups. In the secondary analysis, multivariate Cox regression was used to study the associations between study outcomes and SBP / DBP categories expressed in 10 mmHg increments, referenced to people of the same age group with SBP at 120 - 129 mmHg and DBP at 70 - 79 mmHg. All analyses were adjusted for demographics, duration of diabetes, BMI, smoking status, HbA1c, lipid profile, and use of anti-hypertensive drugs.

**Results:**
We included 393, 518 people with T2D (mean age 61.6 years, mean HbA1c 7.4, 78% pre-existing hypertension) in the analysis. Across age categories, RCS showed non-linear associations between SBP/DBP and study outcomes. An exception was observed among people aged 18-44, where DBP above 50 - 66 mmHg showed a linear increase in risk of CVD, CKD and ESKD. The minimum SBP/ DBP associated with the least hazards for CVD or death differed across age categories and ranged from 90 - 130 / 66 - 82 mmHg for people aged 18 to 59 years and 126 - 140 / 69 - 78 mmHg for people aged 60 years and above. Within each age category, people with SBP above 120-129 mmHg and DBP above 70 - 79 mmHg were associated with higher risk for CVD, CKD, ESKD, and all-cause mortality. The magnitude of increase in risk was strongest among people aged 18-44 years com- pared to other age groups. There was evidence of a J-shaped association with increased risk of CVD and death observed at lower SBP and DBP, especially among people aged ≥ 75 years.

**Conclusion:**
We observed heterogeneity in the relationship between high blood pressure and various clinical outcomes across ages, sug- gesting age-specific blood pressure targets should be considered in individuals with T2D.

**Background and aims:**
Influenza infection poses substantial risk of severe complications, especially in older adults and high-risk popu- lations such as individuals with diabetes. The high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV) has demonstrated superior efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza compared with standard-dose inacti- vated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV). However, there is little evidence on the relative effectiveness of HD-IIV compared with SD-IIV against severe respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with dia- betes. The purpose of this prespecified analysis of the DANFLU-2 trial is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of HD-IIV vs. SD-IIV according to diabetes status in older adults ≥65 years.

**Materials and methods:**
DANFLU-2 was a pragmatic, registry-based, open-label, active-controlled, individually randomized trial conducted in Denmark during the 2022/2023, 2023/2024, and 2024/2025 influ- enza seasons. The trial enrolled older adults ≥65 years regardless of comorbidity, utilizing innovative nationwide recruitment methods and online sign-up and informed consent processes, and requiring only one study visit. Participants were randomized 1:1 to HD-IIV or SD- IIV. Baseline, endpoint, and safety data were obtained from the Dan- ish health registries. In each season, participants were followed for outcomes from 14 days after vaccination through May 31 the follow- ing year. The primary endpoint was hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza; additional prespecified endpoints include cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations, influenza-related hospitalization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality.

**Results:**
Among 332,438 included participants, 40,995 (12.3%) had diabetes at baseline. A total of 166,218 participants (20,522 with dia- betes) were randomly assigned to receive HD-IIV, and 166,220 partici- pants (20,473 with diabetes) to SD-IIV. The mean age of the total study population was 73.7±5.8 years and 161,538 (48.6%) were female. A total of 91,025 (27.4%) participants had cardiovascular disease, 9,405 (2.8%) had a history of myocardial infarction, 10,410 (3.1%) had heart failure, and 16,381 (4.9%) had a history of cerebrovascular disease. Endpoint data are currently being processed and will be available for presentation at EASD 2025. This present analysis will assess the relative effects of HD-IIV vs. SD-IIV on the primary, secondary, and additional relevant exploratory endpoints according to diabetes status.

**Conclusion:**
DANFLU-2 is the largest individually randomized influ- enza vaccine effectiveness trial ever conducted. The trial will provide pre-specified evidence on the relative effectiveness of HD-IIV com- pared with SD-IIV according to diabetes.

**Treatment of gestational diabetes in women with discordant OGTT**

**Background and aims:**
It is unclear if adoption of the wider WHO 2013 diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) improves pregnancy outcomes, compared to the WHO 1999 criteria. We evaluated the effect of GDM treatment in women with an OGTT result discordant between the WHO 2013 and 1999 criteria.

**Materials and methods:**
We performed an open-label, multicenter randomized trial across 21 hospitals in the Netherlands. Women who provided informed consent, with a singleton pregnancy and a 1-step 75 gram OGTT discordant between the WHO 2013 and 1999 diagnostic criteria for GDM, and who were between 16 and 32 weeks gestation, were assigned to either GDM treatment (counselling on the diagnosis, self-monitoring of blood glucose, dietary advice and glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy as needed) or routine antenatal care without GDM treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was a neonate born large-for-gestational-age (LGA; birthweight above the ­90 percentile adjusted for sex and gestational age). Secondary outcomes included maternal and neonatal outcomes.

**Results:**
Between October 2018 and May 2024 we randomized 1,032 women with discordant OGTT results. The mean age was 32.7 years (SD 4.9), 40.2% were nulliparous, and the median pre-pregnancy BMI was 29.7 kg/m (IQR 25.1-34.0). OGTT results were comparable between study arms. Overall, mean plasma glucose was 5.2 mmol/L (SD 0.5), with 1-hour and 2-hour means of 8.6 mmol/L (SD 1.5) and 7.1 mmol/L (SD 1.0), respectively. The primary outcome was available for 991 participants (96.0%). Among women allocated to GDM treat- ment, 92 (18.3%) had an LGA infant, versus 85 (17.4%) among those allocated to routine care (relative risk 1.05; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.38; P = 0.70). Glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy (RR 3.35; 95% CI 2.10 to 5.37), neonatal hypoglycaemia testing (RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.32 to 1.82) and diagnosis (RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.96), and neonatal hospital admission (RR 1.19; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.32) occurred more frequently after allocation to GDM treatment.

**Conclusion:**
Treatment of GDM in women discordant for the WHO 2013 and 1999 diagnostic criteria did not reduce the risk of LGA com- pared to routine antenatal care, but resulted in more healthcare utiliza- tion and neonatal hypoglycemia diagnosis.

**Background and aims:**
There is a lack of randomized controlled tri- als (RCT) with sufficient power to evaluate the impact of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rt-CGM) usage on reducing adverse obstetric outcomes in women with gestational diabetes (GDM). The main hypothesis of this study is that real-time CGM can effectively reduce the risk for neonatal and obstetric complications.

**Materials and methods:**
This open-label international multicenter RCT involved 375 women diagnosed with GDM. Participants were randomly assigned to standard care using self-monitored blood glu- cose (SMBG, n=185) or rt-CGM (n=190). The SMBG group utilized a blinded CGM device for ten days after randomization and between 36-38 gestational weeks. Women in the rt-CGM group were provided with rt-CGM devices until delivery. The difference in the proportion of large for gestational age (LGA) newborns was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included the requirement for glucose-lowering medication, and glucose metrics derived from CGM.

**Results:**
After dropouts, 170 participants in the intervention and 175 in the control group were assessed for the primary endpoint. The risk for the development of LGA infants was reduced in women using rt-CGM as compared to SMBG (3·5% vs. 10·3%, p=0·014). Moreover, newborn weight percentiles were lower in the rt-CGM group. In addition, the rt-CGM group showed improved time in tight range (65-140 mg/dl) between 36 and 38 weeks of gestation, most notably in women who used glucose-lowering medications. There was no difference in the amount of glucose-lowering medication, although rapid acting insulin was more often prescribed to women using rt-CGM (41·2% vs. 30·3%, p=0·035).

**Conclusion:**
Rt-CGM outperforms SMBG in reducing the risk of LGA offspring. Glycemic control improves modestly in rt-CGM users, who also require more rapid acting insulin. Consequently, rt-CGM should be offered as standard care for women with GDM.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes (GD) is characterized as glucose intolerance first recognized during pregnancy. Decline in mitochondrial function was found in the placental and skeletal muscle tissues of women with GD. Studies that measured circulat- ing growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) as a mitochondria stress-related mitokine in GD showed, so far, inconsistent results. This study aimed to examine the mitochondrial function of periph- eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum GDF-15, in both healthy pregnant women and women diagnosed with GD.

**Materials and methods:**
This study included 21 patients diag- nosed with GD, and 21 healthy pregnant women as a control group, between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. At the visit, after obtaining informed consent, body weight and height measurements, a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and venous blood sampling were conducted. PBMCs were isolated using Lymphoprep density gradi- ent medium. The mitochondrial function of fresh isolated PBMCs was measured by high-resolution respirometry in 16 patients and 18 controls. Serum concentrations of GDF15 were measured by ELISA assay in 21 patients and 21 controls.

**Results:**
Mean age (30.71±4.97 years in control and 35.41±5.31 in GD group) and body mass index (25.66±4.8 kg/m2 in control and 28.70±4.86 in GD group) of participants in GD group were significantly higher compared to healthy controls (p< 0.05). Mito- chondrial respiration was lower in PBMCs of women with GD, com- pared to healthy controls in respiration of intact cells (5.65±1,01 amol ­O /(s*cell) in control, n=18 and 4.28±0.99 in GD group, n=16 p< 0.01) and complex I linked oxidative phosphorylation capacity (7.75±2,17 amol ­O /(s*cell) in control n=18 and 5.67±2,11 n=16 in GD group, p< 0.01). No difference was found in serum GDF15 level (58,53±14,37 pg/ml in control and 72,52±31 in GD group, n=21 for both groups, p=0.075), but there were 7 outliers with significantly higher concentration in GD group.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, PBMCs from GD-affected women had decreased mitochondrial respiration when compared to healthy preg- nant women. GDF15 levels should be further studied, as the results are variable in the GD group. These parameters show potential for further exploration, as they could help elucidate the pathophysiologi- cal mechanisms in gestational diabetes, as well as potentially be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.

**Mid-pregnancy lipidomic signatures identify metabolic subtypes associated with divergent pregnancy outcomes**

D. Yu

**Background and aims:**
Maternal metabolic states during mid- pregnancy are increasingly recognized as heterogeneous, yet cur- rent clinical classifications often fail to capture this complexity. This study aimed to apply lipidomic profiling at 24 weeks of gestation to identify distinct metabolic subtypes among pregnant women and to explore their associated clinical characteristics, metabolic profiles, and pregnancy outcomes.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 269 pregnant women at 24 weeks of gestation were recruited. Serum lipidomic profiling was performed using high-throughput mass spectrometry. Unsupervised clustering based on lipidomic data was employed to define metabolic subtypes. Clinical characteristics, gestational diabetes prevalence, incidence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) outcomes, other neonatal complica- tions and differential metabolites profiles were compared across the identified clusters.

**Results:**
Three distinct lipidomic clusters were identified. Cluster A (Insulin-Compensated Subtype): characterized by elevated C-pep- tide, insulin, blood glucose, suggesting preserved insulin secretion. Cluster B (Metabolic High-Burden Subtype): characterized by ele- vated BMI, triglycerides, LDL-C, uric acid, and total cholesterol, reflecting obesity-related dyslipidemia and metabolic burden. Cluster C (Hepato-Renal Stress Subtype): characterized by elevated total bilirubin, creatinine, and AST/ALT ratio and favorable lipid profile, suggesting liver and renal metabolic stress. Despite similar rates of gestational diabetes across the clusters, pregnancy outcomes dif- fered. Cluster A showed a significantly higher incidence of neonatal jaundice, while Cluster B was associated with the highest LGA rate (17.8%). Differential lipidomic analysis identified eight significantly altered lipids, predominantly phosphatidylcholines (PC) and phos- phatidylethanolamines (PE), involved in fatty acid metabolism, mem- brane remodeling, and inflammation.

**Conclusion:**
Lipidomic profiling at 24 weeks of gestation enables early identification of metabolic subtypes with distinct clinical and neonatal outcome patterns. These findings highlight the heteroge- neity of metabolic disturbances during pregnancy and suggest the potential utility of lipid-based subclassification in risk stratification and personalized management of pregnant women.

**Background and aims:**
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a transient form of glucose intolerance during pregnancy that increases maternal and offspring risk. In Denmark, GDM is diagnosed in about 6% of pregnancies, with prevalence expected to rise due to chang- ing screening criteria and higher pre-pregnancy obesity rates. Women with prior GDM have an up to 70% lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes, most pronounced within 3-6 years postpartum, and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death. Despite guideline recom- mendations for postpartum glycaemic testing, adherence remains low, with barriers including lack of information, transition to parenthood, and stigma. This study assesses national adherence to recommended glycaemic testing following GDM.

**Materials and methods:**
Women with at least one delivery com- plicated by GDM were identified via the National Patient Register, linked to the Birth Register from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2022. Women with pregestational diabetes were excluded, resulting in a study population of 19,984 women. The cohort was linked to the Clinical Laboratory Information Register for glycaemic follow-up examined at biochemical departments until 31 December 2023. Gly- caemic tests indicative of diagnostic testing for diabetes — HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) — were identified using Nomenclature for Properties and Units terminology (NPU)-codes. From primary care, HbA1c and point of care blood glucose (proxy for OGTT and available during 2021-2022) were included from the Danish National Health Insur- ance Register.

**Results:**
Nationally, 12.7% (n=2,492) of women with at least 6 months of follow-up (n=19,528) were tested at least once within 6 months post- partum using OGTT, HbA1c, or FPG. Testing rates were 15.9%, 25.5%, and 36.5% after 15, 48, and 84 months, respectively. Thus, between 2015 and 2022, only slightly above one-third of Danish women with prior GDM were screened for diabetes within seven years after deliv- ery. Despite recommendations for all women with GDM to undergo diabetes screening three months postpartum and every 1-3 years there- after, only ~5% fulfilled the criteria of being tested once within the first year and again within the following four years, indicating poor adherence to existing guidelines.

**Conclusion:**
The analysis reveals low participation in postpartum glycaemic testing among women with prior GDM, heightening the risk of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes and early complications. Improved strategies for clinical follow-up of women after GDM and systematic monitoring of adherence rates are needed.

**Background and aims:**
The intrauterine environment plays a pivotal role in shaping long-term health outcomes, with birthweight and early childhood weight gain serving as important indicators of child devel- opment. We have previously identified associations between maternal and cord serum biomarkers at birth and child growth outcomes. In this study, we investigated the changes in maternal biomarker levels between the 2nd and 3nd trimester and explored whether the asso- ciations between serum biomarkers at birth and weight at one year of age hold when accounting for key maternal and fetal characteristics, including maternal body mass index (BMI), maternal age, and the sex of the child.

**Materials and methods:**
As part of the LIFE Child study, maternal serum samples at the 36th gestational week (GW) and umbilical cord serum at birth were collected from 86 healthy mother-child pairs. For 60 of these mother-child pairs, serum samples taken at the 24th GW were also available. All pregnancies were uncomplicated, and the children were born at term with age-appropriate birthweight (2500 - 4500g). Analysis was performed using the Olink® Target 96 Car- diovascular III panel (92 biomarkers). Statistical analyses inlcuding wilcoxon t-test and multivariate regression analyses were performed using R.

**Results:**
Of the 92 biomarkers analyzed, 6 had normalized protein expression (NPX) values that were below the lower limit of detection, so that only 88 biomarkers could be assessed within our cohort. 70 of these biomarkers were found to be upregulated at the 36th GW, including Gal-4, Myoglobin and MMP2 (p<0.05 for all). Adversely, 17 biomarkers including COL1A1 (p<0.05) were downregulated. Neither maternal serum biomarkers nor cord serum biomarkers sampled at birth showed any significant associations with birthweight once adjusted for maternal age, maternal BMI and child sex. However, several significant associations were found with with child weight at one year of age. In cord serum, CD163 (p<0.01), PAI (p<0.01), TLT2 (p<0.01) and EGFR (p=0.01) sampled at birth all showed significant associations with child birthweight, while both PON3 (p=0.04) and ITGB2 (p=0.04) in mater- nal serum at the 36th GW were significantly associated with child weight at one year of age.

**Conclusion:**
Cardiovascular and immune-related biomarkers meas- ured in maternal and cord serum at birth were not associated with birth weight after adjusting for maternal BMI, age, and child sex. However, several of these biomarkers showed significant associations with infant weight at one year of age, indicating that their relevance emerges postnatally. This suggests that early-life activation of inflam- matory, vascular, or cell signaling pathways may contribute to growth regulation beyond the neonatal period, independent of maternal and child-related factors

7. ON, Canada, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.

**Background and aims:**
The combination of once-weekly subcutane- ous cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg (CagriSema) provided an estimated mean body weight reduction of 13.7% and improvements in glycaemic control in people with BMI ≥27 kg/m and T2D. This subgroup analysis assessed the effect of CagriSema on glycaemic con- trol measured by CGM.

**Materials and methods:**
REDEFINE 2 was a phase 3a, double-blind, randomised, placebo (pbo)‑controlled, multicentre trial in which par- ticipants (pts) with BMI ≥27 kg/m and T2D ­(HbA 7-10%) treated with ≤3 oral glucose-lowering drugs, were randomised 3:1 to once- weekly subcutaneous. CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg or pbo with lifestyle intervention for 68 weeks. Pts in the CGM subgroup from selected US sites were equipped with a Dexcom G6 ­Pro device for double-blinded measurements during week -3 to baseline and during weeks 64 to 68. Additional personal monitoring devices were permitted alongside the provided CGM device. Assessments by weight loss category (<10%, ≥10-<15%, ≥15-<20% and ≥20%) in the CGM subgroup included the following: time in range (>3.9-≤10.0 mmol/L), time above range (>10.0-≤13.9 mmol/L), time above high range (>13.9 mmol/L), time below range (≥3.0-≤3.9 mmol/L) and time below low range (<3.0 mmol/L). Data are for the on-treatment observation period.

**Results:**
Of the 1206 pts randomised (CagriSema, n=904; pbo, n=302), 199 were included in the CGM subgroup (CagriSema, n=149; pbo, n=50). For pts treated with CagriSema in the CGM subgroup, 47.7% were male, with a mean age of 61.3 years, body weight 102.8 kg, ­HbA 8.0%, and T2D duration of 10.2 years; 23.5% and 22.8% were receiving sulfonylureas and SGLT-2 inhibitors, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar to that of the overall study population but with a slightly longer T2D duration and a lower proportion of Asian pts. In the CagriSema group, time in range improved from baseline to week 68 across all weight loss categories ( ). Absolute values for time in range at week 68 were higher for greater weight loss categories. Time below range at week 68 was very low (≤1.9%) across all weight loss categories. Analysis of change in time in range from baseline to week 68 showed an improvement of approximately 50%-points regardless of weight loss when weight loss was assessed on a continuous scale ( ).

**Conclusion:**
CagriSema provided a substantial increase in the time spent in glycaemic range at week 68 across a range of weight loss categories and improved time spent in glycaemic range from baseline to week 68 regardless of achieved weight loss.

**Pharmacokinetics, weight loss, and tolerability of the ultra-long acting amylin analogue MET-233**

G. Gaich, M. Stroh, J. Minnion, B. Hubbard, S.P. Marso

**Background and aims:**
MET-233 is an ultra-long acting amylin analog. Preclinical studies demonstrated a unique pharmacokinetic pro- file with a long half-life and high potency. The ultra-long acting nature of MET-233 may allow for monthly dosing and weekly dosing with simplified titration. Here, we report the findings of single-ascending dose (SAD) and multiple-ascending dose (MAD) studies of MET-233 in adults with overweight/obesity (BMI 27-38 kg/m²) without type 2 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a randomized, double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled, Phase 1 clinical trial. In the SAD, participants were assigned to 5 cohorts, and randomized to single subcutaneous doses of MET-233 (0.15 mg, 0.30 mg, 0.60 mg, 1.2 mg, 2.4 mg) or placebo. In the MAD, participants were assigned to 4 cohorts, and randomized to receive 5 weekly doses of MET-233 (0.15 mg, 0.30 mg, 0.60 mg, 1.2 mg) without titration or placebo. Key endpoints included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and % change from baseline in body weight.

**Results:**
A total of 80 participants were enrolled in the SAD and MAD parts of the trial. The preliminary SAD data demonstrated an observed half-life (time to 50% ­C ) of ~19 days, and Day-8 placebo-subtracted body weight loss of up to 5.3% from baseline after a single dose. Gas- trointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) were mostly mild and none were severe. The MAD demonstrated up to 8.4% placebo-subtracted body weight loss from baseline at Day 36 (Figure). All GI AEs in the MAD were mild, and most were restricted to Week 1. Candidate starting doses (0.15 mg and 0.30 mg) had placebo-like tolerability.

**Conclusion:**
In this clinical trial, MET-233 demonstrated a pharma- cokinetic profile consistent with monthly dosing, robust body weight loss, and placebo-like tolerability at anticipated starting doses.

Adults aged 18-80 years with a BMI 20.0- 39.9 kg/m were allocated into groups according to renal function using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration cre- atinine equation (2021) adjusted for estimated individual body sur- face area: normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min), mild impair- ment (eGFR 60-89 mL/min), moderate impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/ min), severe impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min, not requiring dialysis) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD; requiring dialysis). Participants received a single dose of s. c. amycretin 0.3 mg, which was followed by a 4-week follow-up period which included amycretin PK blood sam- pling and safety assessments. The primary endpoint was AUC​ for plasma amycretin from baseline to end of study (EOS). Supportive secondary endpoints included maximum observed plasma amycretin concentration ­(C ), terminal half-life ­(t ) and number of treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from baseline to EOS. Additional safety information, including laboratory assessments, ECGs and vital signs, were also collected.

**Results:**
A total of 42 participants were included (n=14 in the normal renal function group; n=7 in each of the renal impairment groups). AUC​ and ­C tended to be higher in the renal impairment groups versus in the normal renal function group, as demonstrated by esti- mated treatment ratios (with the normal renal function group as ref- erence) (Table). Geometric mean ­t tended to be longer with higher degrees of renal impairment. These observations were not considered clinically relevant. A total of 81 TEAEs were seen in 30 (71.4%) par- ticipants. TEAEs were non-serious and mild or moderate in severity (majority were mild). The most frequent TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders. Overall, the reporting of TEAEs was generally similar with no observed pattern across the normal renal function and impaired renal function groups. The additional safety information collected did not raise any safety concerns.

**Conclusion:**
Renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe and ESRD) did not appear to have a clinically relevant impact on the PK proper- ties or safety profile of amycretin, suggesting that dose adjustment of amycretin is not warranted in this population. Amycretin appeared to be well tolerated in all groups and had a similar safety profile to other GLP-1 receptor agonists with no new safety findings reported.

**Background and aims:**
GLP-1-based anti-obesity therapies effectively promote weight loss but are often accompanied by lean mass reduction. GLP-2, in contrast, contributes to muscle preservation by enhancing nutrient absorption and insulin sensitivity. PG-102, a novel bispecific Fc-fusion protein targeting GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptors, was evalu- ated for its dual benefit on fat reduction and muscle preservation. This study aimed to evaluate whether PG-102, alone or in combination with Bimagrumab could improve body composition outcomes compared to Semaglutide-based therapy.

**Materials and methods:**
Twenty-seven-week-old diet-induced obese (DIO) male C57BL/6J mice (21 weeks on high-fat diet) were ran- domized into 6 groups (n=4-6/group) and treated for 18 days with vehicle, Semaglutide (30 nmol/kg, QD), PG-102 (20 mg/kg, QW), Bimagrumab (20 mg/kg, QW), or their combinations. Body weight was measured every other day, and body composition (fat and lean mass) was analyzed weekly by DEXA. Adipose and muscle tissues were collected at the study endpoint for both histological evaluation and biochemical analysis of atrophy- and metabolism-related gene expression.

**Results:**
Combined treatment with PG-102 and Bimagrumab induced ~20% body weight loss, similar to or slightly below that of the Sema- glutide + Bimagrumab combination. Both PG-102 and Semaglutide monotherapies reduced fat mass by ~47%, with further reduction to ~52% and ~57%, respectively, when co-administrated with Bima- grumab. Notably, PG-102 preserved lean mass more effectively than Semaglutide, showing a ~5% higher lean mass in monotherapy, sug- gesting intrinsic muscle-preserving effect likely driven by GLP-2 receptor activation. Importantly, these effects were achieved with once- weekly administration of PG-102, compared to daily administration of Semaglutide. When combined with Bimagrumab, PG-102 led to a net lean mass gain of ~5%, whereas the Semaglutide + Bimagrumab group exhibited a ~4% lean mass loss, highlighting a unique synergis- tic benefit of PG-102. Furthermore, biochemical analysis of skeletal muscle cells revealed that PG-102 treatment significantly downregu- lated and , two key atrophy-related genes, suggest- ing a reduction in catabolic signaling and a potential enhancement of muscle maintenance and function at the molecular level.

**Conclusion:**
PG-102 combined with Bimagrumab delivers a syner- gistic, next-generation obesity therapy that not only reduces fat mass effectively but also preserves—and even increases—lean muscle mass. Remarkably, this was achieved with once-weekly PG-102 dosing, unlike daily Semaglutide-based regimens. These results highlight the added clinical value of GLP-2 receptor engagement and suggest that PG-102 may enhance both muscle function and metabolic quality, sup- porting its potential to redefine obesity treatment.

**Background and aims:**
While the overall aim of weight reduction focuses on excess adiposity, weight loss with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) is associated with a significant reduc- tion of lean mass (LM). Based on preclinical data, we hypothesized that the co-administration of semaglutide (sema), and anti-Myosta- tin: trevogrumab (trevo), with or without anti-Activin A: garetosmab (garet), will enhance the quality of weight loss by mitigating the loss of LM and increasing the loss of fat mass (FM).

**Materials and methods:**
Participants with obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m ), without Type 2 diabetes (N=599), were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive sema titrated up to 2.4 mg (SC QW) alone or in combination with trevo 200 mg (SC QW), or trevo 400 mg (SC QW) with or without garet 10 mg/kg (IV Q4W)), or matching placebos. The primary endpoints were percent change in LM and FM as measured by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry and percent change in body weight (BW) from baseline to Week 26. Efficacy analyses were conducted using Efficacy Estimand and employed Mixed Models for Repeated Measures.

**Results:**
This interim analysis (IA) was performed when 50% of partic- ipants (mean age [SD]: 49 [12.9] years, BMI 36.7 [5.0] kg/m , female 67.9%) completed 26 weeks. Participants randomized to sema alone lost 10.4% of BW, of which ~3.6 kg was LM, which accounted for ~35% of the BW lost. Compared to sema monotherapy, trevo with or without garet prevented most of the LM loss. The trevo arms prevented about 50% of the LM loss, with the trevo/garet arm preventing >80% of LM loss. High dose trevo demonstrated greater FM loss, and the trevo + garet combination arm showed an increase in FM loss and BW loss (Table). The trevo + sema combination was generally well-tolerated. The sema with trevo + garet combination had a higher incidence of serious adverse events and discontinuations. Two deaths occurred in the sema+trevo+garet arm; a causal association has not been established.

**Conclusion:**
A weight management strategy combining trevo with or without garet on top of sema is associated with LM preservation and greater FM loss. The full dataset of this study will be presented at EASD.

**PG-102, a bispecific GLP-1/GLP-2 Fc fusion protein, outperforms dual-function peptide and combination therapy in preclinical mod- els and induces dose-dependet weight loss in obese subjects**

S.-I. Yang

1. ProGen. Co., Ltd, Seoul, Republic of Korea, SL Bigen. Co., Ltd,

**Background and aims:**
While GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) achieve significant weight loss in patients with obesity, their long-term utility is limited by lean mass loss, gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, and poor tolerability. PG-102 is a novel Fc-fusion protein with bispe- cific agonism targeting both GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptors, designed to enhance metabolic efficacy while preserving muscle mass. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of weight loss and translational relevance of PG-102 in preclinical models and early-phase human studies.

**Materials and methods:**
In a diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model, PG-102 was administered subcutaneously every other day (Q2D) at doses of 15, 30, and 60 nmol/kg for 2 weeks. Comparators included GLP-1-Fc, GLP-2-Fc, their combination, and dapiglutide (GLP-1/ GLP-2 peptide). Endpoints included body weight, body composi- tion, glucose tolerance, and serum biomarkers. Mechanistic studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes evaluated gene expression and lipid metabolism. A Phase 1c multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial evaluated weekly PG-102 (up to 80 mg) in obese participants over 8 weeks, assessing body weight, safety, and tolerability.

**Results:**
PG-102 induced dose-dependent weight loss in mice, with preferential visceral fat reduction and preservation of lean mass. Compared to dapiglutide and GLP-1/GLP-2-Fc combination therapy, PG-102 achieved 3.8-fold and 1.5-fold greater body weight reduction, respectively. Mechanistic data revealed significant upregulation of ther- mogenic and lipolytic genes ( ), suggesting potent dual action on adipose tissue. In humans, PG-102 was well tolerated at up to 80 mg weekly with no discontinuations. Placebo-adjusted body weight loss reached −2.4% (60 mg) and −4.8% (80 mg), confirming a clear dose-response and translational consistency with preclinical results.

**Conclusion:**
PG-102, as a bispecific GLP-1/GLP-2 Fc-fusion protein, outperforms the dual peptide dapiglutide in delivering fat-selective, muscle-preserving weight loss in preclinical models. Its favorable toler- ability and dose responsive efficacy in humans support its potential as a differentiated, next-generation obesity therapy. These findings support the continued clinical development of PG-102.

**Comparative effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide vs dulaglu- tide on cardiovascular outcomes in US Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease**

X. Tan, C. ­Swift

1. Novo Nordisk Inc., Plainsboro, NJ, USA, Genesis Research Group,

**Background and aims:**
GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) with proven cardiovascular (CV) benefits are guideline-recommended thera- pies for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in people with atherosclerotic cardiovas- cular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk for ASCVD. Once-weekly (OW) semaglutide and dulaglutide, two widely used GLP-1 RAs, showed CV risk reduction in RCTs and real-world studies. However, no studies have directly compared their CV outcomes, a critical gap given the rising diabetes burden in the United States (US), particularly among Medicare beneficiaries—an older, multimorbid population underrep- resented in RCTs. This study compares the risk of major adverse car- diovascular events (MACE) between Medicare beneficiaries initiating OW semaglutide and dulaglutide.

**Materials and methods:**
This observational cohort study used Medi- care fee-for-service claims data (2006-2022) under a target-trial emula- tion framework. Eligible patients had confirmed T2D and ASCVD, ≥2 index drug prescriptions (OW semaglutide or dulaglutide), were aged ≥66 years at index drug initiation, and had no prior GLP-1 RA use. Patients were followed until the earliest of outcome occurrence, death, disenrollment, study end, index drug discontinuation, or sodium-glu- cose cotransporter-2 inhibitor initiation (censored only if SGLT2i-naïve at baseline). Outcomes included 3-point MACE (stroke, myocardial infarction [MI], all-cause death), 5-point MACE (stroke, MI, unstable angina hospitalization, heart failure hospitalization, all-cause death), 2-point MACE (stroke, MI), and individual stroke and MI events. The two treatment strategies were matched using 1:1 nearest neighbor matching; baseline characteristics were balanced after matching. Sur- vival analyses included cumulative incidence curves and doubly robust Cox proportional hazards regression.

**Results:**
After matching, 29,168 OW semaglutide and 29,168 dula- glutide users were included (mean age 73.2 years). Incidence rates of 3-point MACE were 30.3 and 40.0 events per 1000 person-years for OW semaglutide and dulaglutide, respectively. OW semaglutide was associated with significantly lower risks of 3-point MACE (hazard ratio = 0.77, < 0.001), 5-point MACE ( = 0.75, < 0.001), 2-point MACE ( = 0.79, < 0.001), and stroke ( = 0.67, < 0.001) versus dulaglutide ( ). No significant difference was found in MI ( = 0.90, = 0.21).

**Conclusion:**
Among US Medicare beneficiaries with T2D and ASCVD, OW semaglutide was associated with reduced risks of MACE outcomes compared to dulaglutide. These findings provide critical clin- ical insights to fill the evidence gap and guide GLP-1 RA selection in this large, high-risk population.

**Background and aims:**
No antihyperglycaemic therapies have shown significant benefit in reducing MALE (adjudicated hospitalisation for acute limb/chronic limb-threatening ischaemia) outcomes in people with T2D at risk of/with established PAD. We assessed the effect of semaglutide on MALE in pts with T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
A pooled pt-level analysis of three RCTs evaluated the effects of semaglutide (SOUL 14 mg PO OD; FLOW and STRIDE 1.0 mg SC OW) on MALE. SOUL: 9650 pts with T2D and ASCVD/CKD; FLOW: 3533 pts with T2D and CKD; STRIDE: 792 pts with T2D and symptomatic PAD. Primary outcome: MALE. Other outcomes: composites of MALE/MACE, MALE/CV death and MALE/all-cause death. Analyses were stratified by baseline PAD status.

**Results:**
Of 13,975 pts with T2D across the three trials, 2892 (20.7%) had a history of PAD, 29% were female, 92% had hypertension and 60% had CAD. Median age, 67 years; ­HbA , 7.7%; eGFR, 67 mL/ min/1.73 m²; SBP, 135 mmHg; and LDL-C, 1.9 mmol/L. Use of back- ground vascular-protective therapies was high: lipid-lowering therapy (86%), ACE inhibitors/ARBs (82%) and antiplatelet therapy (70%); 25% were receiving SGLT2is. Pts with vs without PAD had higher levels of hsCRP and eGFR, and greater use of antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapies. Semaglutide significantly reduced the risk of MALE (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.53, 0.91]; p=0.0072) (Figure), with both components (i.e. acute/chronic limb ischaemia) contributing to this benefit. Sema- glutide also reduced MALE/all-cause death, HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.77, 0.93); MALE/CV death, HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.72, 0.92); and MALE/ MACE, HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.76, 0.91). These benefits were consistent for all outcomes regardless of baseline PAD status, with no evidence of heterogeneity (p>0.60). The efficacy of semaglutide on MALE was also consistent across baseline eGFR and SGLT2i use (p>0.10).

**Conclusion:**
In pts with T2D at risk of/with established PAD, sema- glutide reduced the risk of MALE by 30%, with consistent benefit observed regardless of baseline PAD status. Thus, semaglutide may reduce the burden of PAD, for which no current antihyperglycaemic therapies have demonstrated efficacy.

**Background and aims:**
Since July 2024, several pharmacoepide- miology studies have been published evaluating whether there is an increased risk of non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) with semaglutide use. The aim of this study was to investigate the inci- dence of NAION across completed randomised clinical trials evaluat- ing the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) liraglu- tide and semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes and/or overweight/ obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
This study used data from all completed phase 2, 3 and 4 randomised controlled trials with a placebo group conducted by the sponsor. MedDRA and narrative searches were used to identify potential NAION events. Two ophthalmologists performed independent, masked reviews of potential NAION events and cat- egorised them based on the likelihood of NAION event occurrence (‘definite’, ‘probable’, ‘unlikely’ or ‘not assessable’). In case of disa- greement, the independent, blinded reviews underwent a process of rec- onciliation. For the purpose of this study, events classified as ‘definite’ or ‘probable’ were considered to be confirmed NAION events. Data were evaluated both for GLP-1RAs as a drug class and for liraglutide and semaglutide individually.

**Results:**
This pooled analysis included over 93,000 participants (GLP- 1RA arms: n=61,729; placebo arms: n=31,776) with over 203,000 participant-years of observation (PYO) (GLP-1RA arms: 117,053.5 PYO; placebo arms: 86,238.5 PYO) (Table). Across all completed tri- als, three confirmed NAION events were identified in the GLP-1RA arms (semaglutide trials: three events; liraglutide trials: no events) and five confirmed events were identified in the placebo arms (semaglu- tide trials: one event; liraglutide trials: four events). In the GLP-1RA arm, the incidence rate of confirmed NAION events was ~8 events per 100,000 PYO, while in the placebo arm, the incidence rate was ~7 events per 100,000 PYO. All ophthalmologist-confirmed events in both arms reported one or several confounding factors such as participant age [>50 years], obesity, smoking, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Furthermore, no pattern in the time to onset of the events was observed.

**Conclusion:**
Data from all randomised placebo-controlled trials with semaglutide and liraglutide do not suggest an increased incidence rate of NAION in participants randomised to GLP-1RA treatment versus those receiving placebo.

**Background and aims:**
Recurrent weight gain and/or suboptimal initial weight loss following metabolic/bariatric surgery (MBS) are common and carry significant health concerns. Low meal-stimulated circulating levels of glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) have been associ- ated with poor responses to MBS, and adjuvant Liraglutide has been shown to be beneficial, however, there are a lack of randomized clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of Semaglutide 2.4mg for this indication.

**Materials and methods:**
A double-blinded, randomised (1:1), placebo- controlled trial of Semaglutide 2.4mg weekly (BARI-STEP) recruited adult participants at least 1 year after a primary Gastric Bypass or Sleeve Gastrectomy who had experienced either suboptimal weight loss or weight regain defined as 20% or less body weight loss from sur- gery. This was an adjunct to lifestyle intervention with a 500-kcal daily energy deficit. Participants were recruited from 2 London Hospitals, United Kingdom. The treatment period was 68 weeks and a subsequent 4-week follow-up. Last participant follow-up was completed in April 2025. The primary outcome was % weight loss (%WL) at the end of the 68-week treatment on an intention-to-treat analysis. Participant safety was assessed through monitoring of clinical and biochemical param- eters and assessment for adverse events.

**Results:**
A total of 70 participants were randomized to receive 2.4mg Semaglutide (n=35) or placebo (n=35). Estimated change in mean (SD) %WL from baseline to week 68 was 17.9 (9.13) with Semaglutide, 2.4mg (n=34), vs -0.4 (7.06) with placebo (n=31). The mean differ- ence in percentage body weight change for Semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs placebo was -18.32 (95% CI, -14.25 to -22.4; P < .00001). Adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal and mostly mild. There were 8 serious adverse events, 1 suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction and no treatment-related deaths. Out of 70 participants, 63 completed follow-up.

**Conclusion:**
BARI-STEP, the first randomised, placebo-controlled trial in this patient population, demonstrates that Semaglutide 2.4mg weekly, in people with recurrent weight gain and/or suboptimal initial weight loss following MBS, results in substantial, clinically significant and sustained body weight reduction compared to placebo. These find- ings suggest Semaglutide 2.4mg is an effective treatment option for this patient population and strengthen the evidence-base for combination therapies for people with severe obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Many people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D) on basal insulin therapy often need treatment intensification to reach their glycaemic targets. However, intensifying insulin therapy is asso- ciated with hypoglycaemia and weight gain. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of once-weekly (OW) semaglutide s. c. 2.0 mg as an add-on to dose-reduced insulin glargine (IGlar) vs dose-titrated IGlar in PwT2D.

**Materials and methods:**
In this multinational, multi-centre, ran- domised, parallel-group, open-label, phase 3b study, eligible partic- ipants aged ≥18 years with a BMI of ≥25 kg/m² and inadequately controlled T2D ­(HbA : 7%-9%), and on once-daily basal insulin (up to 40U/day) and metformin, with or without sodium glucose cotrans- porter 2 inhibitors, were randomised (1:1) to receive either OW sema- glutide s. c. 2.0 mg as an add-on to dose-reduced IGlar U100 (IGlar (reduced)+sema) or dose-titrated IGlar U100 (IGlar (titrated)). The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 40 in ­HbA . Key secondary endpoints were change in body weight and daily insulin dose. A 0.3% margin was used to establish non-inferiority for change in ­HbA . If non-inferiority was achieved, all endpoints were then tested for statistical superiority.

**Results:**
A total of 573 eligible participants were randomised. At base- line, the mean age was 61 years, with 56% being male. The mean T2D duration was 12.4 years, with a mean ­HbA of 7.9% and a mean body weight of 94 kg. Non-inferiority was achieved, and superior- ity was also confirmed for IGlar (reduced)+sema vs IGlar (titrated) in ­HbA change (-1.37% vs -0.63%, estimated treatment difference (ETD): -0.74 [95% CI, -0.90; -0.59, p< 0.0001]) ( ). The body weight change from baseline at week 40 was -8.00 kg with IGlar (reduced)+sema group vs +0.45 kg in IGlar (titrated) (ETD: -8.45 [95% CI, -9.52; -7.39]) group ( ). In the IGlar (reduced)+sema group, 36% achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in insulin dose (OR: 66.83 [95% CI, 14.35; 311.18]) vs 1% in IGlar (titrated), and 78% reached the target of ­HbA <7% (OR: 5.65 [95% CI, 3.83; 8.34, p< 0.0001 for all]), compared to 39% in the IGlar (titrated). The rates of severe hypoglycae- mic events were lower in IGlar (reduced)+sema vs IGlar (titrated) (2.5 vs 5.8 events per 100 patient-years of exposure, p<0.0039).

**Conclusion:**
Once-weekly semaglutide s. c. 2.0 mg demonstrated supe- rior ­HbA reduction and weight loss, while reducing the daily insulin dose and the risk of severe hypoglycaemia in PwT2D on basal insulin. Hence, it provides an effective and safe treatment option for this patient population compared to insulin titration.

**Background and aims:**
Accurate estimates of the global burden of T1D are essential for informing care planning and advocacy. We aimed to update 2025 estimates of T1D prevalence, incidence, mortality, and life expectancy in 202 countries and project prevalence to 2040, using the T1D Index Version 3.0 and the IDF Atlas 11th Edition.

**Materials and methods:**
We used an enhanced Markov model with modules for incidence, adult onset, mortality and prevalence. It incor- porated updated population-based data and used regression-based extrapolation for countries lacking data. Life expectancy was derived using T1D-specific mortality and demographic assumptions. Validation was conducted against published prevalence data.

**Results:**
In 2025, 9.5 million people are estimated to be living with T1D globally, up 13% from 2021. Incident cases are projected at 513,000, including 222,000 in people <20 years. Premature deaths due to T1D are estimated at 174,000, of which 30,000 result from non-diagnosis. Life expectancy at age 10 with T1D ranges from 6 years (South Sudan) to 66 years (Norway). An estimated 3.4 million people are missing from global prevalence due to premature death, including 669,000 from non-diagnosis. By 2040, the global T1D population is projected to rise to 14.7 million, with the greatest increases expected in Africa (+120%) and the Middle East/North Africa (+86%).

**Conclusion:**
The global T1D burden continues to increase rapidly, particularly in low-income regions, driven by rising incidence, age- ing, improved diagnosis and falling mortality. Data gaps in over half of countries highlight the need for improved T1D surveillance and care equity.

**Background and aims:**
Previous findings suggested that there are age- related endotypes of type 1 diabetes (T1D) with different underlying etiopathological mechanisms in those diagnosed at age <7 years com- pared with those diagnosed at age ≥13 years. We set out to describe the gut microbiota, serum metabolites and lipids, and scRNA-seq characteristics of children and adolescents with T1D to explore the heterogeneity of age-related endotypes.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 108 T1D patients and 56 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Patients were grouped by age at onset into early (T1DE, <7 years), intermediate (T1DI, 7-12 years), and late (T1DL, ≥13 years) -onset subtypes. We described and compared clinical characteristics, the gut microbiota, serum metabo- lites and lipids, and peripheral scRNA-seq profiles among T1DE, T1DI, T1DL subgroups. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with T1D were stimulated using identified metabolites to evaluate potential multi-omics network interaction.

**Results:**
Distinct microbiota taxa were enriched per group: (T1DE, LDA=3.49), (T1DI, LDA=5.56), (T1DL, LDA=5.78). Func- tional pathways differed, with T1DE enriched in , and T1DL in . Differen- tial metabolite analysis (VIP≥1, FC≥1.2, q<0.05) identified 56, 59, and 84 upregulated metabolites, and 15, 13, and 24 lipids in each T1D subgroup. Subtype-specific molecules included (T1DE, FC=1.96) and (T1DL, FC=5.63). Pathway enrichment revealed in T1DE (p=0.049) and in T1DL (p=0.043). ScRNA-seq (32,177 genes from 376,996 cells) identified 13 immune cell types and 4 B cell subtypes. decreased from T1DE to T1DL (12.21%-8.45%- 6.19%, p_adj<0.02), mainly due to (7.23%-4.97%-3.75%, p_adj<0.03). Group-specific differentially expressed genes showed that T1DE enriched pathways (e.g. NF-kappaB), T1DL pathways, and T1DI . The microbiota-metabolite/lipid- gene network included the axis. In vitro stimulation of peripheral B cells with docosapentaenoic acid upregulated STMN1 expression at 1 mM (p_adj=0.03) and 2 mM (p_adj=0.04).

**Conclusion:**
This study reveals distinct immune-metabolic signatures among age-related T1D endotypes. T1DE exhibited stronger immune activation, T1DL showed metabolic predominance, and T1DI displayed intermediate features. Functional validation supports inter-omics regu- latory links, nominating docosapentaenoic acid-STMN1 as a potential immunometabolic target in T1D.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a major clinical concern in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This study aimed to assess the prevalence of DKA and describe characteristics of affected patients using real-world data.

**Materials and methods:**
This retrospective study included participants from the French SFDT1 cohort. Data were initially collected between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2024. Index date corresponded to patient’s latest visited documented in SFDT1. Extracted variables included sociodemographic details, medical history, diabetes-related factors (disease duration, treatments, HbA1c) and complications. We calculated the prevalence of DKA and severe hypoglycemic episodes (SHE) as the proportion of patients reporting at least one event in the 12 months prior to the index date. Comparative statistical analyses were performed to evaluate differences between patients with and without DKA. All statistical tests were two-tailed with a significance level of 5%.

**Results:**
We included 2,685 patients, 51.4% male, mean age 36.5 years (SD 16.0) and mean age at diabetes diagnosis of 16.1 years (SD 9.0). Most participants were adults: 14.9% were aged 18-24 years, 69.3% aged 25-64 years, and 5.5% aged 65 or older. Mean HbA1c was 7.7% (SD 1.4), with the following insulin administration modalities: multiple daily injections (MDI) 36.1%, insulin pumps without algorithm 41.6%, automated insulin delivery (AID) 21.5%. Continuous Glucose Moni- toring was used by 95.6% of patients. At least one DKA had occurred in 4.5% [95%CI 3.8%; 5.4%] of the participants, with the following number of episodes: 1 episode 74.6%, 2 episodes 11.5% and more than 2 episodes 13.9%. Table 1 shows that DKA was associated with younger age at T1D diagnosis, longer T1D duration, low BMI and higher HbA1c but not treatment modality. SHE occurred more fre- quently in those with at least one DKA episode.

**Conclusion:**
DKA remains a significant complication in people with T1DM, even treated with AID. The association between DKA and SHE underscore the importance of closely monitoring glycemic variabil- ity and supports the educational reinforcement of ketone monitoring. These findings emphasize the need for personalized and data driven diabetes management.

**Hyperkalaemia in acutely hospitalised persons with type 2 and type 1 diabetes does not increase 30 days mortality compared to hospitalised persons without diabetes**

F. Egeberg, H. ­Nygaard, R.G. ­Mottlau, S.B. ­Haugaard

**Background and aims:**
To examine the association between serum potassium level and 30-day mortality in acutely hospitalized persons, and to assess if diabetes status impacts the association. Increased potas- sium associates to mortality, but it is not known if diabetes status exac- erbates mortality in this setting.

**Materials and methods:**
Data from Danish National Registries and electronic patient records provided information regarding adult (≥18 years old) patient contacts from emergency departments in The Capital Region of Denmark years 2017-2021. The Region has approximately 1,500,000 people of age 18 years or older. The population was catego- rized in groups of serum potassium levels 3.5—4.4 mM (normoka- lemia), 4.5—4.9 mM, 5.0—5.9 mM, 6.0—6.4 mM, and ≥6.5 mM, respectively. People with type 2 (T2D) and type 1 (T1D) diabetes were identified. The association between serum potassium level and 30-day survival were estimated by unadjusted cox regression analysis and step- wise adjusted cox regression analyses adjusted for potential confound- ing patient characteristics. We were able to adjust for multiple factors associated to risk of death including sex, age, multimorbidity index M3, previous hyperkalemia, cohabitation status, education, medica- tion 6 months prior to admission, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, body temperature, respiratory rate, triage, sodium concentration, AKI and infection.

**Results:**
The population of normo- and hyperkalemic patients, who had a measurement of acute parameters within 4 hours from admission, accounted to 217,431 patient contacts without diabetes, 15,603 had T2D and 1,959 had T1D. They had a median age of 59/72/67 years, and 5,718 (2.6%) / 796 (5.3%) / 99 (5.1%) died within 30 days, respec- tively. Unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) using normokalemia of non- diabetes as reference, were HR 1.95 (CI 95%: 1.77—2.14) for T2D with normokalemia, potassium level 4.5—4.9 mM HR 3.86 (3.30—4.50), for 5.0—5.9 mM HR 8.33 (6.89—9.96), for 6.0—6.4 mM HR 14.6 (8.84—22.4), and HR 17.6 (11.0—26.5) for ≥6.5 mM, correspond- ing to fully adjusted HRs 1.05 (0.93—1.17), 1.32 (1.11—1.57), 2.04 (1.65—2.49), 2.36 (1.42—3.67), and 2.60 (1.60—3.96), respectively. The fully adjusted HRs for mortality were similar for T2D, T1D and non-diabetes persons for each category of hyperkalemia. The diagnosis of diabetes interacted significantly with 30-day mortality in unadjusted analysis but not after full adjustment (p=0.1).

**Conclusion:**
The 30-day mortality risk was significantly and consecu- tively increased when serum potassium levels exceeded 4.4 mM in crude analyses and remained so after adjusting for relevant confounders in acutely hospitalized T1D, T2D and non-diabetes persons. However, diabetes status was not associated with exacerbates mortality in this setting.

**The effect of fenofibrate on the progression of diabetic retinopathy**

**Background and aims:**
The Lowering Events in Non-proliferative retinopathy in Scotland (LENS) trial showed benefit of fenofibrate for diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy (DR) progression in participants with diabetes and early DR. This confirmed hypothesis-generating DR results from earlier major cardiovascular trials of fenofibrate in participants with type 2 diabetes. Primary outcome results in LENS were consistent in participants with type 2 or other diabetes (collec- tively referred to here as T2DM) and type 1 diabetes (T1DM) but there were relatively few events in those with T1DM. Given that data for fenofibrate specific to people with T1DM remains limited, we per- formed additional analyses of secondary ocular LENS outcomes by diabetes subtype.

**Materials and methods:**
LENS was a randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial. A Cox proportional-hazards model, adjusted for baseline covariates included in the minimised randomisation (sex, age, type of diabetes, eGFR, HbA1c, use of statins, most recent DR grades), was used to investigate the effect of fenofibrate on the follow- ing secondary outcomes according to type of diabetes: (i) any progres- sion of DR, (ii) progression to referable diabetic maculopathy, and (iii) development of diabetic macular oedema. Chi-squared tests were used to assess heterogeneity for these outcomes between participants with T1DM and those with T2DM.

**Results:**
LENS randomised 1151 participants between fenofibrate (n=576) and placebo (n=575), of whom 305 (26.5%) had T1DM and 846 (73.5%) had T2DM, and followed them for an average of 4.0 years. As previously reported, fenofibrate reduced the primary outcome of progression to referable DR or the need for treatment, with consistent effects in those with T1DM and T2DM. The effect of fenofibrate on the three ocular secondary outcomes was also consistent across both T1DM and T2DM populations, with no statistical evidence of hetero- geneity (see figure). In individuals with T1DM, there were nominally significant reductions in any DR progression (52 (34%) events in 154 participants allocated fenofibrate vs. 69 (46%) events in 151 partici- pants allocated placebo; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.98) and progression to referable diabetic maculopathy (28 (18%) vs. 41 (27%); HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.99). Few events of diabetic macular oedema occurred in participants with T1DM.

**Conclusion:**
These results support a protective effect of fenofibrate in slowing the progression of DR in people with early DR, irrespective of their diabetes type. Ongoing trials will contribute further evidence of the effect of fenofibrate in those with T1DM.

3. tal, Helsinki, Finland, Research Program for Clinical and Molecular
4. Metabolism, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, Department

**Background and aims:**
Cardiovascular mortality is significantly higher among individuals with type 1 diabetes compared to the gen- eral population, with heart failure being a leading cause of excess morbidity and mortality. Despite its substantial impact, heart failure in type 1 diabetes remains relatively understudied. Hyperglycaemia and diabetes duration are established risk factors of heart failure in type 1 diabetes, yet the impact of long-term cumulative exposure to hyperglycaemia is less explored. We investigated the relationship between cumulative glycaemic exposure and heart failure in type 1 diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
This longitudinal study included 2572 adults with type 1 diabetes from the FinnDiane cohort with repeated HbA1c measurements before the study baseline and no history of heart failure. The cumulative glycaemic exposures were calculated from diabetes diagnosis to the study baseline. Two measures were derived: total cumulative glycaemic exposure ­(CGE ) and cumu- lative hyperglycaemic exposure ­(CGE ), accounting only for time spent above an ­HbA of 53 mmol/mol (7%). Cox proportional haz- ards models were used to assess the association between cumula- tive glycaemic exposure and heart failure during follow-up. The following covariates were added to the fully adjusted model: sex, age, diabetes duration, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, lipid-lowering medication, hypertension, BMI, smoking, kidney disease and history of CVD (including coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral artery disease).

**Results:**
By the end of year 2020, 267 participants were diagnosed with heart failure, during a median follow-up of 18.3 years. Participants with incident heart failure had an adverse risk profile at baseline: they were older, had a longer diabetes duration (32.23 ±10.37 vs 22.13 ±11.85 years, p <0.001) and had higher HbA1c (71.74 ±15.62 vs 68.26 ±15.90 mmol/mol, p <0.001), blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and triglycer- ides. Both cumulative and monthly glycaemic exposures were higher among those who later developed heart failure. Cumulative glycaemic exposures before baseline remained significantly associated with heart failure during follow-up after adjustments: ­CGE (HR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.05], p = 0.011) and ­CGE (HR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.05], p = 0.010). Compared to the lowest tertile of ­CGE , the highest one was associated with an increased risk of heart failure (HR 1.70 [95% CI 1.14-2.53], p = 0.009) in the fully adjusted model.

**Conclusion:**
Both total cumulative glycaemic exposure and glycae- mic exposure above the treatment goal increase the risk of heart failure in type 1 diabetes. These associations remained significant even after adjusting for other key risk factors such as kidney disease and prior cardiovascular disease. The findings underscore the impor- tance of consistently minimizing glycaemic exposure, regardless of diabetes duration and other diabetes complications, to reduce the risk of heart failure in type 1 diabetes. Further studies are needed on cumulative exposure to other risk factors, as well as research evaluat- ing risk factors in different heart failure subtypes.

2. gow, Glasgow, UK, Clinical Epidemiology Division, Department of

**Background and aims:**
Combination therapy is gaining attention in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) management due to its potential to achieve treatment goals within a shorter period. However, the long- term cardiorenal effectiveness of fixed- versus loose-dose combinations remain unclear. This study aimed to assess whether oral antidiabetic fixed-dose combination (FDC) is associated with improved cardiorenal outcomes in adults with T2DM, compared to loose-dose combination (LDC) therapy. A secondary objective was to evaluate the mediating role of medication adherence in these associations.

**Materials and methods:**
This is an active-comparator, new-user, Swedish population register-based cohort study. A total of 65,305 adults with T2DM who initiated metformin and subsequently added a non-metformin antidiabetic agent in FDC or as LDC were included. Propensity score matching without replacement was used to balance baseline characteristics between groups. A total of 27,766 people entered the cohort after matching. Cox regression was applied for out- come analyses. Proportion of days covered (PDC) during the first year greater than 80% was used as a proxy for adherence.

**Results:**
Median follow-up time was 4.0 years for cardiovascular out- comes and 3.8 years for the kidney outcome. In the matched cohort (mean age 62 years; 67% male), FDC users had higher treatment adher- ence (68.6% vs. 46.5%). FDC versus LDC therapy was associated with a lower rate of heart failure (HR=0.88; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.99), with adherence to treatment mediating 47% of this association. In people aged ≥65 years, FDC was associated with a lower rate of heart failure (HR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.91). The observed association was attenu- ated with further matching for diabetes duration, or when drugs were matched at ATC code level. No associations between using FDC and other outcomes were identified.

**Conclusion:**
FDC therapy in T2DM was associated with a lower rate of heart failure, particularly in older adults. Higher medication adherence appeared to mediate nearly half of this association.

**The effect of empagliflozin on extracellular fluid volume and epi- cardial adipose tissue in patients at risk of heart failure: main**

**Background and aims:**
The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is increasing, creating a need for therapeutic prevention. Obesity con- tributes to HF pathophysiology through several mechanisms. Volume overload promotes elevated cardiac filling pressures, while excess epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is believed to exert proinflammatory and mechanical effects on the myocardium. We aimed to investigate the effect of the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin on estimated extracellular volume (eECV) and ven- tricular EAT mass in patients with obesity and high risk of HF.

**Materials and methods:**
This was an investigator-initiated, ran- domised, placebo-controlled clinical trial. We randomised patients with BMI >28 kg/m and existing non-HF cardiovascular disease 1:1 to receive double-blind treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo for 180 days. Patients with known diabetes were excluded. The primary endpoints were baseline-adjusted mean differences in change from baseline to end-of-treatment in 1) calculated eECV and 2) ventricular EAT mass measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Data were analysed using a constrained linear mixed model with inherent baseline adjustment and adjustment for age, sex and study site. Results were reported with Bonferroni-adjusted -values.

**Results:**
A total of 191 patients were randomised (empagliflozin: 94, placebo: 97), of whom 191 patients and 165 patients contributed data for analysis of eECV and ventricular EAT mass, respectively. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced across the two groups with median age of 68 years and median BMI of 31.9 kg/m². As con- current risk factors, 169 (89%) had hypertension and 126 (66%) had ischaemic heart disease, while only 2 (1%) had an eGFR of 30-45 ml/ min/1.73m . Compared to placebo, empagliflozin resulted in a sig- nificantly greater reduction in eECV (estimated treatment difference: -0.123 L, 97.5% CI: -0.211-0.035, =0.004), but had no effect on ventricular EAT mass (1.5 g, 97.5% CI -3.8 to 6.7, =1.00). The empagliflozin group experienced more non-severe urinary tract infections (7 vs. 1, =0.03) and genital mycotic infections (9 vs. 0, =0.002), but overall, the drug was safe.

**Conclusion:**
In this trial, 180-days treatment with empagliflozin resulted in a significant decrease in eECV with no change in ven- tricular EAT mass among high-risk patients with obesity without diabetes. These findings highlight the potential benefits of empagli- flozin beyond its established indications. Large-scale outcome trials are warranted to determine whether the decrease in eECV translates to clinically relevant preventive effects in patients with obesity and high risk of HF.

**Background and aims:**
The CONFIDENCE study reported benefits of simultaneous initiation and combination therapy with finerenone and a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) in reducing urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). In this prespecified analysis, we evaluated whether baseline glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use modified the treatment effects of combination therapy with finerenone and an SGLT2i.

**Materials and methods:**
Adults with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes with a UACR of ≥100 to <5000 mg/g on a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor were enrolled in the CONFIDENCE trial. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to once daily finerenone (10 or 20 mg) plus empagliflozin (10 mg), finerenone (10 or 20 mg) plus placebo, or empagliflozin (10 mg) plus placebo. Treatment effects on the primary endpoint of relative change in UACR from baseline at day 180 were assessed by baseline GLP-1 RA use.

**Results:**
Among 800 participants (full analysis set), 182 (23%) were using a GLP-1 RA at baseline. At day 180, there was a change in UACR from baseline (95% CI) in participants using a GLP-1 RA of −51% (−59, −40) with combination therapy, −34% (−48, −18) with finerenone alone, and −36% (−48, −21) with empagliflozin alone; Table). Similar reductions were observed in those not using a GLP-1 RA at baseline. In the GLP-1 RA group, changes in UACR at day 180 with combination therapy vs finerenone alone and empagliflozin alone were −25% (−44, 1) and −23% (−42, 3), respectively. In those with baseline GLP-1 RA use, treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia adverse events occurred in 9.0, 11.5, and 6.5% in the combination, finerenone alone, and empagliflozin alone groups, respectively. In those without GLP-1 RA use, the proportions were 9.5, 11.3, and 2.9%, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
In CONFIDENCE, simultaneous initiation with finer- enone and an SGLT2i was effective and well-tolerated, irrespective of background use of a GLP-1 RA.

**Background and aims:**
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant plasma cell disorder with potential progression to multiple myeloma (MM). Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity, may influence clonal evolution and immune dynamics. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demon- strated potential anti-neoplastic properties. This study evaluated the association between GLP-1 RA use and clinical outcomes in individu- als with MGUS and concurrent DM, overweight, or obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX global health research network. Adults with MGUS and either DM or overweight/obesity were identified. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed, resulting in two balanced cohorts (n=13,187 each). Matching was based on demographic variables, relevant clinical comorbidities, laboratory and clinical parameters, as well as concomitant medication use. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included over- all survival (OS), time to progression to symptomatic MM, and major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure (HF).

**Results:**
Among 26,374 propensity score-matched individuals, 731 individuals in the GLP-1 RA group and 1,975 in the control group experienced either progression to symptomatic MM or death. Overall, 731 patients receiving GLP-1 RA therapy and 2,178 patients in the control group died during the follow-up period. Treatment with GLP-1 RAs was associated with significantly improved PFS [HR (95% CI): 0.650 (0.597-0.709)] and OS [HR (95% CI): 0.617 (0.566-0.672)], both p<0.001. A non-significant trend toward a reduced risk of progression to symptomatic MM was also observed [HR (95% CI): 0.872 (0.727- 1.045)]. Additionally, 415 patients with MGUS receiving GLP-1 RAs and 739 patients in the control group experienced a MI during the fol- low-up period. A total of 298 patients on GLP-1 RAs and 534 patients in the control group experienced a stroke within the same time win- dow. GLP-1 RA users had lower cumulative incidence rates of MI, HF, ischemic heart disease, and stroke; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance in time-to-event analyses for myocardial infarction and heart failure.

**Conclusion:**
GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with significantly improved PFS and OS in patients with MGUS and metabolic comor- bidities. Although a lower incidence of cardiovascular events was observed, this was not confirmed in time-to-event analyses. These findings support the need for prospective studies to further evaluate the potential role of GLP-1 RAs in modifying disease progression and clinical outcomes in this population.

2. lands, HarvestCare, Rotterdam, Netherlands.

**Background and aims:**
While dietary interventions can effectively support type 2 diabetes management, financial constraints often make it difficult for individuals with lower socioeconomic status (SES) to adopt and maintain a healthy diet. ’Food Prescription Programs’ (FPPs), designed to increase access to healthy food using financial incentives, has shown great potential in increasing patients’ food security, leading to significant improvement of HbA1c levels in the USA. However, to our knowledge these programs have not been studied in the European context. Therefore, this study aims to determine the difference in the 3-month effectiveness of a FPP on glycaemic regulation compared to usual dietetic care, in adults with type 2 diabetes and overweight.

**Materials and methods:**
In this 3-month randomised controlled pilot study, people with type 2 diabetes and overweight (BMI > 25), between 18-75 years old, with an annual income of less than 25,000 euros from the Rotterdam South region were included. Both the control and inter- vention group received a Mediterranean diet and three coaching ses- sions with a dietician for three months. In addition, participants in the intervention group received the FPP, consisting of free weekly healthy plant-based food boxes supplied by local farmers for 3 months, plus three health- and culinary workshops. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in HbA1c from baseline to three months. Other outcome measures included anthropometric values, cardiovas- cular risk factors, food intake, medication use, treatment satisfaction and quality of life. Follow-up measurements will be performed after six months (data available during EASD meeting).

**Results:**
Thirty-five people with T2D and overweight (mean age 57.3 years; 74% female) are included in January 2025, of whom 17 received the FPP. Within the intervention group, after 3 months the intake of fruit (78±53 to 156±107 g, p=0.034) and vegetables (145 (87-225) to 177 (135-273) g/d, p=0.002) increased, accompanied by improvements in weight (92.0±24.8 to 90.8±24.5 kg, p=0.016), BMI (31.0 (27.6- 37.5) to 29.7 (26.4-38.7) kg/m2, p=0.015), fasting glucose (8.9±1.9 to 8.3±1.6 mmol/l, p=0.041) and quality of life (SF-36 physical limitations: 56.3±40.3 to 85.9±31.6, p=0.018; emotional wellbeing: 72.5±15.0 to 77.8±12.3, p=0.025). In the control group, no significant changes were reported. For the between-group differences, the change in intake of vegetables (177 (135-273) vs 140 (100-156) g, p=0.040), quality of life (physical limitations 85.9±31.6 vs 40.4±38.9, p=0.001; emotional limitations 91.7±25.8 vs 68.8±41.2, p=0.045) and treatment satisfaction (10.9±6.2 vs 4.6±7.6, p=0.021) were significantly better in the intervention group compared to the control group after 3 months. No differences were seen in HbA1c, medication use or cardiovascular risk factors.

**Conclusion:**
With this pilot of, to our knowledge, the very first Food Prescription Program in Europe, we demonstrate the feasibility of the program and encouraging effects on dietary intake, weight, quality of life and treatment satisfaction among people with type 2 diabetes and low socioeconomic status. These results are an important stimulus for the design of larger RCTs on the effect and potential implementation of FPPs to increase health equity among people with type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Elevated circulating ketone concentrations can signal metabolic instability (e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis). However, we previously showed that ingesting ketone monoesters (KM) before a single meal reduces postprandial glycaemia, whilst maintaining serum insulin concentration, in individuals with type 2 diabetes. To further explore the viability of this intervention to manage blood glucose, we aimed to test the hypothesis that pre-meal KM ingestion consistently reduces postprandial glucose concentrations in individuals with type 2 diabetes over consecutive meals, and explore secondary outcomes characterising the associated insulin response.

**Materials and methods:**
Twelve participants with type 2 diabetes (age 61±2 years, 4 females, BMI 30.9±0.5 kg/m , ­HbA 63±3 mmol/ mol [7.9±0.3%]) completed two consecutive 4-hour mixed-meal tol- erance tests (MMTT1 and MMTT2), on two separate visits. On each visit, participants consumed either 0.5g/kg body mass KM or a non- caloric, taste-matched placebo, 30 minutes prior to each MMTT in a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. Circulating ketone (β-hydroxybutyrate; βOHB), glucose, insulin and C-peptide concen- trations were determined in regular blood samples. Insulin secretion was determined by C-peptide deconvolution, permitting modelling of insulin clearance and β-cell glucose sensitivity. Individual data were averaged over each MMTT. Differences between treatment and MMTT were analysed by 2-way ANOVA and presented as mean±SEM.

**Results:**
Plasma βOHB concentration was greater with KM versus placebo in MMTT1 (2.9±0.2 vs. 0.2±0.0 mmol/L) and MMTT2 (3.5±0.2 vs. 0.2±0.0 mmol/L; treatment <0.001). Postprandial blood glucose concentration decreased with KM versus placebo in MMTT1 (9.54±0.58 vs. 8.91±0.54 mmol/L) and MMTT2 (8.60±0.46 vs. 7.66±0.41 mmol/L; treatment <0.001). Serum insulin concen- tration increased with KM in MMTT1 (316±29 vs. 372±39 pmol/L; interaction <0.05), but not MMTT2 (283±28 vs. 300±32 pmol/L). Insulin clearance rate decreased with KM in MMTT1 (0.95±0.07 vs. 0.78±0.06 L/min/m ) and MMTT2 (1.03±0.10 vs. 0.82±0.08 L/min/ m ; treatment <0.001). Insulin secretion rate did not differ with KM in MMTT1 (259±20 vs. 263±24pmol/min/m ), with a tendency for this to decrease with KM in MMTT2 (241±17 vs. 220±18 pmol/min/ m ; time 0.01, interaction =0.06). However, across the duration of the trial, β-cell glucose sensitivity appeared to be greater with KM vs. placebo (by 27±18%; =0.06).

**Conclusion:**
We show for the first time that ingesting ketone monoesters consistently decreases postprandial glycaemia with repeated meals. This is associated with elevated insulin concentration (especially after the first meal, and relative to glucose throughout), driven predominantly by decreasing insulin clearance rate. Despite the markedly lower glucose concentration, insulin secretion remained relatively unaffected. This suggests a second potential benefit, whereby ketones may enhance pancreatic β-cell glucose sensitivity, which requires further investigation.

**Background and aims:**
Response to a complex lifestyle intervention can be modulated by patients’ metabolic phenotype and its adap- tive response to an energetically demanding situation. Metabolic adaptation to exercise, measured during the incremental exercise test, reflects the efficiency of the dynamic interplay between energy needs and substrate availability which could provide clinically rel- evant parameters applicable in the frame of individualized lifestyle interventions.

**Materials and methods:**
Fifty-one middle-aged individuals with obe- sity were randomized into intervention (n=36, age 36.0±6.1 yrs, BMI 34.0±4.0 kg/m , 20F/16M) and control (n=15, age 34.0±7.0, BMI 34.0±4.0 kg/m , 10F/5M) groups. Three-month lifestyle intervention included supervised aerobic/strength exercise (3x1h/week), weekly nutritional counselling bi-monthly coaching. Exercise-related meta- bolic flexibility was examined in a submaximal incremental cycling test combined with indirect calorimetry. Liver and adipose tissues were examined using 3T MR system (Siemens). Hepatic lipids were meas- ured by localized 1H-MRS, volume of visceral (VAT) and subcutane- ous (SAT) adipose tissues was determined with a T1-weighted fast spin echo, and concentration of mono and poly-unsaturated fatty acids in deep SAT, superficial SAT and VAT was assessed with single voxel MRS STEAM technique. Gastrocnemius muscle MRS was performed using 7T human MR system (Siemens) and MR-compatible ergometer. 1H-MRS detected concentrations of acetylcarntine, carnosine, intramy- ocellular lipids (IMCL) and creatine, while 31P-MRS yielded phos- phorus signals of ATP, NAD, phosphodiesters, inorganic phosphate and phosphomonoesters. The dynamic 31P-MRS protocol was used to examine depletion of PCr during 6min of submaximal exercise (VPCr) and the rate of PCr resynthesis during 6min recovery (TPCr), the rate of oxidative phosphorylation (capacity to generate ATP, Qmax).

**Results:**
A 3-month complex lifestyle intervention improved exercise- related metabolic flexibility (p=0.03), body composition and glucose metabolism, lowered hepatic lipids (p=0.01), increased levels of unsaturated fatty acids in VAT depots (p=0.004) and reduced visceral adiposity (p=0.04) and deposition of IMCL in gastrocnemius muscle (p=0.001). Moreover, intervention increased functional capacity of muscle mitochondria to generate ATP as evidenced by higher Qmax (p=0.02) and lower τPCr (p=0.01). Exercise-related metabolic flex- ibility and its training-induced changes (?) correlated negatively with volume of SAT and VAT. Importantly, this parameter tended to cor- relate negatively with the content of saturated fatty acid but positively with unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid content in both VAT and SAT.

**Conclusion:**
Our observations suggest that the capacity to modulate substrate preference during exercise is related to both the quantity and composition of the adipose tissue and its training-induced changes.

2. jing, China, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.

**Background and aims:**
Physical inactivity is a fundamental contribu- tor to chronic diseases in modern society, yet regular exercise improves metabolic health via production of a series of metabolites. However, the function of exercise metabolites in energy metabolism requires further elaboration.

**Materials and methods:**
C57BL/6J male mice were assigned to four subgroups randomly based on two factors: diet (standard chow or high- fat), and locomotion condition (static cages or cages furnished with running wheels). An integrated precise metabolomics and proteomic profiling of liver tissues was simultaneously performed to comprehend the effects of voluntary wheel running on hepatic metabolites changes, functional proteins and signaling pathways.

**Results:**
Our study revealed that voluntary wheel running exercise ameliorated metabolic disorders triggered by a high-fat diet, encom- passing obesity, the impairment of glucose tolerance, and hepatic lipid deposition. Precise metabolomics of liver tissues indicated that N-lactoyl-phenylalanine (Lac-Phe), as a newly exercise-induced metabolite, was significantly increased with voluntary wheel running exercise intervention. Then, an integrated precise metabolomics and proteomic profiling found that Lac-Phe could promote hepatic oxi- dative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), with upregulated expression of mitochondrial complex I. Upon further investigation, we observed that Lac-Phe injection could alleviate hepatic steatosis triggered by high-fat diet, and activate hepatic OXPHOS capacity.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, our study was innovative in demonstrating that voluntary wheel running exercise could significantly increase the Lac-Phe content in livers, and then facilitate energy metabolism by activating OXPHOS. This finding paves the way for future investiga- tions aiming to explore potential therapeutic interventions.

**Background and aims:**
HRS-7535, an oral small molecule GLP-1RA, is under development for T2DM and obesity. The study evaluated its efficacy and safety in Chinese participants (pts) with T2DM inade- quately controlled by metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor.

**Materials and methods:**
This randomised, double-blind, multicenter phase 2 study included a screening period, a 3-wk single-blind lead in period, a 16-wk double-blind treatment period, and a safety follow-up period. During the lead in period, HRS-7535 placebo tablet and hena- gliflozin metformin extended-release tablets were administrated to pts. 155 pts were randomised (1:1:1) to HRS-7535 30 mg group, 60 mg group, or placebo (PBO) group. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in ­HbA at wk 16.

**Results:**
A total of 147 (94.8%) completed the study, and 8 discon- tinued (6 withdrawal of consent, 1 lost to follow-up and 1 physician decision). At baseline, mean age was 54.0 yrs, 64.5% were male, mean body weight was 69.9 kg, mean BMI was 25.7 kg/m² and mean ­HbA was 8.5%. At wk 16, the least-squares (LS) mean changes from baseline ­HbA in HRS-7535 30, 60 mg and PBO groups were -1.5%, -1.8%, and -0.4%, respectively ( <0.0001 for two doses vs PBO) (Figure). In ­HbA baseline >8.5% subgroup, the LS mean changes from baseline ­HbA inHRS-7535 30 mg, 60 mg and PBO groups were -1.6%, -2.6% and -0.7%, respectively ( <0.0001 for two doses of PBO). The proportion of pts with ­HbA <7% in HRS-7535 30, 60 mg, and PBO groups were 51.0%, 66.0% and 9.8%, respec- tively. The LS mean percent changes in body weight of HRS-7535 30, 60 mg and PBO groups were -1.6%, -2.4%, and -0.7%, respec- tively. The treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurrence in HRS-7535 30, 60 mg, and PBO group were 74.5%, 75.0% and 56.9%, respectively. Most TEAEs in the study were mild to moder- ate. The most common (≥5%) TEAEs in all pts were nausea (13.0%), vomiting (11.7%), lipase increased (11.0%) and decreased appetite (5.8%). Moreover, no signs of hepatotoxicity were observed in HRS- 7535 groups. In total, 5 pts (5.8%) in HRS-7535 groups and 1 (2.0%) in the PBO group had documented hypoglycemia and all hypoglyce- mia events were grade 1.

**Conclusion:**
HRS-7535 achieved significant HbA1c reduction in Chinese pts with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor, and exhibited a safety profile consistent with other GLP-1RAs. These data support further clinical development of HRS-7535 for T2DM treatment.

**Orforglipron is associated with improvements in markers of beta cell function and insulin sensitivity when used as monotherapy in people with type 2 diabetes**

L. Ludwig

**Background and aims:**
Orforglipron, a novel non-peptide glucagon- like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), demonstrated greater glycemic control and weight reduction versus placebo when used as monotherapy in people with early type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a 40-week, double-blind, phase 3 study (ACHIEVE-1). This prespeci- fied analysis aims to explore the effects of orforglipron versus pla- cebo on markers of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity.

**Materials and methods:**
ACHIEVE-1 randomized 559 patients with T2D treated with diet and exercise alone for at least 90 days prior to screening, a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥7% (53 mmol/mol) to ≤9.5% (80 mmol/mol), and body mass index (BMI) ≥23.0 kg/m to receive once daily oral orforglipron (3, 12, and 36 mg) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Fasting markers of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity, including changes in homeostatic model assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA2-B, computed with C-peptide), homeo- static model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR, com- puted with insulin), insulin, C-peptide, glucagon and serum glucose were assessed at week 40. Results from the efficacy estimand were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures.

**Results:**
At baseline, participants had a mean age of 53 years, type 2 diabetes duration of 4.4 years, HbA1c of 8.0%, body weight of 90.2 kg, and 61.7% had not previously used any glucose-lowering medication. At week 40, orforglipron 3, 12, and 36 mg were superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c and weight (Table 1). In addition, all orforglipron doses improved fasting and self-monitored glucose profiles compared with placebo. Beta-cell function assessed by HOMA2-B was signifi- cantly increased from baseline by 49.9% to 64.1% with orforglipron (all doses, p<0.001) versus no significant change with placebo (4.5%) at week 40. Orforglipron significantly decreased glucose-adjusted glucagon levels from baseline compared to an increase with placebo (-12.8% to -33.1% vs +19.6%). Improvements in insulin sensitivity were observed, as indicated by reductions from baseline of -12.0% (p<0.001), -9.4% (p=0.057) and -18.7% (p<0.001) in HOMA2-IR with OFG 3, 12 and 36 mg respectively, and significant reductions from baseline of up to -14.4% in fasting insulin levels (p<0.05 for all doses of orforglipron). No significant change from baseline in C-peptide lev- els was observed in orforglipron or placebo groups at week 40.

**Conclusion:**
In people with early type 2 diabetes, markers of both beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity were improved at week 40 with OFG monotherapy versus placebo in conjunction with reductions in HbA1c and body weight. These improvements likely contribute to the beneficial effect of orforglipron on glycemic control.

**Dorzagliatin enhances GLP-1 secretion by restoring the function of intestinal L-cells**

Q. Shao

**Background and aims:**
Glucokinase activators (GKAs) are novel anti-diabetic drugs regulating glucose homeostasis by activating glu- cokinase. Dorzagliatin, a recently approved GKA in China that co- activates hepatic/pancreatic glucokinase, has shown clinical success. TTP399 is another GKA in Phase III clinical trials, which selectively targets hepatic glucokinase. Both drugs exhibit beneficial hypoglyce- mic effects in previous studies, but their underlying mechanisms are still lacking. GLP-1, an incretin hormone that lowers blood glucose by insulin stimulation and glucagon suppression, has been reported to increase with oral dorzagliatin administration in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. In this study, we aim to determine whether GKA-mediated hypoglycemic effects universally involve GLP-1 secretion, as well as the detailed mechanism by which the target GKA molecules increase the secretion of GLP-1.

**Materials and methods:**
T2D/obese mice were generated by 5 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Dorzagliatin (20mg/kg), TTP399 (100mg/kg) or vehicles were taken orally 1 hour before OGTT. Total GLP-1 and insulin levels were measured in tail vein blood collected at −30 and 15 min. For mechanistic studies, long-term treatment in the HFD mouse model was carried out. After 30 days daily treatment with the dorzagliatin, TTP399 or vehicles, the intestinal tissues (ileum and colon) were collected. Immunostaining, gene expression and western blot detection were performed. In addition, mouse intestinal organoids (mIOs) were generated and used for the related mechanism studies.

**Results:**
In HFD mice, both dorzagliatin and TTP399 significantly reduced blood glucose levels. Serum insulin and total GLP-1 levels were significantly higher in the Dorzagliatin group 30 minutes after administration, whereas no significant difference was observed in the TTP399 group. There are two essential participators in the pro- gress of GLP-1 production, proglucagon gene ( ) and prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3, encoded by ). Under the stimulation of HFD, the intestinal L-cell function was impaired and the mRNA lev- els of and were down-regulated, resulting in the defective GLP-1 production. In this study, we found that and mRNA levels in the ileum and colon of dorzagliatin-treated mice were sig- nificantly higher than those in the HFD group, while there was no significant difference in the TTP399 group. Additionally, the abun- dance of GLP-1 expression was remarkably increased in the dor- zagliatin group compared to HFD control. Similarly, in mIOs, dorzagliatin enhanced total GLP-1 secretion and significantly upregu- lated and mRNA expression.

**Conclusion:**
Our study reveals the unique ability of dorzagliatin to promote the synthesis of GLP-1 in intestinal L-cells, while TTP399 lacks this effect. The observed upregulation of and genes and increased L-cell abundance further demonstrate the role of dor- zagliatin in restoring L-cell function, underscoring its superior thera- peutic potential for T2D compared with other GKA, such as TTP399.

**Decoupling glycaemic control from weight loss in advanced type 2 diabetes using a bispecific GLP-1/GLP-2 agonist with enhanced human tolerability**

S. Kim

1. ProGen, Co. Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea, SL BiGen, Inc., Incheon,

**Background and aims:**
GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have transformed T2D care, yet their utility is constrained by suboptimal HbA1c target achievement, dose-limiting gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, and unintended weight loss—particularly in catabolic or lean patients. GLP-2 receptor activation, with established roles in gut barrier function and anti-inflammatory signaling, offers complementary ben- efits but has been largely underutilized in diabetes. PG-102 is a bispe- cific, Fc-fused GLP-1/GLP-2 receptor agonist optimized for human pharmacokinetics and receptor potency. This study evaluates PG-102 in multiple metabolically vulnerable models—including two distinct catabolic mouse models of advanced T2D and an underweight diabetic feline model—as well as in healthy human volunteers

**Materials and methods:**
PG-102 was evaluated in two independ- ent mouse models of T2D: a moderate-stage model (HbA1c 9-10%) with slow progressive weight loss, and a severe-stage model (HbA1c >10%) characterized by rapid β-cell failure and catabolic wasting. Comparisons were made against tirzepatide and retatru- tide. Glycemic control, body weight, and metabolic biomarkers were assessed. PG-102 was also administered to an underweight diabetic feline model to explore its glycemic and weight-stabilizing effects in a metabolically vulnerable state where conventional GLP-1-based therapies may be less suitable. A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial (NCT06309667) assessed pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and glucose responses in healthy subjects.

**Results:**
PG-102 induced profound glycemic improvement in a cata- bolic mouse model, achieving sustained normoglycemia with greater durability and depth of glucose control than tirzepatide or retatrutide. Notably, PG-102 preserved body weight throughout the treatment period, in contrast to the progressive weight loss observed in comparator arms. This dissociation between glycemic benefit and catabolic weight loss suggests a distinct therapeutic mechanism. In the feline model, PG-102 improved glycemic control while supporting recovery of healthy body weight. In the Phase 1 MAD trial, PG-102 demonstrated low GI side effect burden and no treatment-related dis- continuations, supporting dose initiation without titration. Human OGTT improvements mirrored preclinical glucose control patterns.

**Conclusion:**
PG-102 offers robust and sustained glucose lowering with preservation or recovery of body weight, even in metabolically vulner- able states. Unlike conventional GLP-1-based therapies that often link glycemic improvement with undesired weight loss, PG-102 demon- strates the potential to decouple these outcomes. This unique profile positions PG-102 as a next-generation incretin therapy for patients with advanced or lean T2D, where current options remain suboptimal.

4. land, University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary,

**Background and aims:**
The REDEFINE 1 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of a combination of semaglutide (sema) 2.4 mg and cagrilin- tide (cagri) 2.4 mg (CagriSema) as a treatment for overweight/obesity. This analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of cagri 2.4 mg, a long-acting amylin analogue, as a monotherapy.

**Materials and methods:**
REDEFINE 1 was a phase 3a, double- blind, placebo (pbo)-controlled, trial in adults with body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m , or ≥27 kg/m with ≥1 obesity-related comorbid- ity, without diabetes. Participants (pts) were randomised 21:3:3:7 to receive once-weekly s.c. CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg, sema 2.4 mg, cagri 2.4 mg or pbo, in addition to lifestyle intervention, for 68 weeks. This analysis of the cagri vs pbo groups assessed percentage change in body weight (BW; %) from baseline, propor- tions of pts achieving categorical BW reductions, and change in waist circumference (WC; cm), all from baseline at week 68. Safety was assessed descriptively. Results are for the treatment policy estimand unless otherwise specified.

**Results:**
Of the total population (N=3417), 302 were randomised to cagri and 705 to pbo. Of those pts, most were female (66.4%) and White (70.8%) with a mean age, BW, BMI and WC of 47 years, 106.6 kg, 37.9 kg/m and 114.1 cm, respectively. Cagri led to a signifi- cantly greater reduction in mean BW (−11.5%) vs pbo (−3.0%) with an estimated treatment difference (ETD) of −8.4 (95% CI −9.7, −7.2; p<0.0001). Similar results were seen for the trial product estimand (−11.8% vs −2.3%; ETD −9.6 [95% CI −10.6, −8.5; p<0.0001]). A significantly greater proportion of pts receiving cagri had categorical BW reductions of ≥5%, ≥10% and ≥15% than those receiving pbo (p<0.0001 for all) ( ). Mean reduction in WC was significantly greater for cagri than for pbo (−10.6 cm vs −4.0 cm; ETD −6.6 [95% CI −7.9, −5.3; p<0.0001]). The leading class of adverse events (AE) was gastrointestinal (GI)-related disorders, experienced by 54.0% of pts in the cagri group and 39.9% in the pbo group. The most common GI-related AEs occurring with cagri were nausea, constipation, diar- rhoea and vomiting (23.8%, 20.5%, 15.2% and 7.0%, respectively), compared with pbo (12.6%, 11.6%,12.1%, and 4.1%). Nausea and vomiting events were mainly transient, mild-moderate in severity and occurred mostly within the dose-escalation phase (16 weeks) ( ). Nausea led to permanent discontinuation of cagri in 1.0% of pts vs 0.1% for pbo. The proportion of pts experiencing injection-site reaction AEs was 7.3% for cagri and 0.6% for pbo.

**Conclusion:**
In adults with overweight/obesity, without diabetes, treat- ment with cagri 2.4 mg led to a clinically meaningful reduction in body weight and waist circumference vs pbo, with a favourable safety profile.

**Background and aims:**
Sex differences may influence pathophysiol- ogy, treatment response, and outcomes of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We assessed whether sex affected clinical response to GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in a large real-world cohort.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a multicentre, retrospective, longitudinal study of individuals with T2D initiating GLP-1RA ther- apy across 18 Italian diabetes centres, with participants stratified by self-reported sex. The primary outcome was change in body weight over time, while secondary outcomes included changes in ­HbA , renal function, and lipid profile, analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures adjusting for baseline imbalances.

**Results:**
We included 7847 individuals, of whom 4705 (60%) were males. The two cohorts were well-balanced for age, diabetes dura- tion, and ­HbA (mean 8.0%). Females had higher BMI but fewer micro- and macrovascular complications. Over a median 4-year follow-up, females experienced a significantly greater weight reduc- tion than males by a mean (SE) of 1.0 (0.2) kg (p<0.001). This result persisted after progressive adjustment for variables that dif- fered between sexes (fully-adjusted mean difference (SE): -1.1 kg (0.2); p<0.001), and remained consistent across GLP-1RA molecules and after accounting for weight-adjusted drug doses. The greatest disparity in weight reduction was recorded for injectable semaglu- tide, with females loosing on average 2.4 kg more than males. More females than males achieved a weight loss of ≥5% (66.5% vs. 58.0%; p<0.001) or ≥10% (40.0% vs 30.7%; p<0.001). Instead, no differ- ences between sexes were detected in ­HbA reduction (mean differ- ence 0.4 mmol/mol; p=0.21) and eGFR decline (p=0.78).

**Conclusion:**
In this real-world cohort of T2D individuals, females experienced greater weight loss than males after GLP-1RA initia- tion, independently of the type of molecule and dosing. These find- ings highlight sex as a potential predictor of GLP-1RA response and support individualized T2D management. Further investigation is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms underlying this sex- specific response.

**Impact on food noise after initiating semaglutide treatment:**

**Background and aims:**
Food noise refers to obsessive and intrusive thoughts about food and poses a significant challenge for individu- als striving to manage their weight. This cognitive and emotional distraction can lead to overeating and hindering of a healthy lifestyle implementation, including weight management efforts. The effective- ness of semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, in promoting weight reduction in obese patients is well established. However, studies evaluating its impact on food noise symptoms and their effects on mental health are lacking. This survey aimed to gain insights into the potential positive change in the impact of food noise and mental wellbeing before and after initiating semaglutide.

**Materials and methods:**
A mobile survey was completed in May 2025 by 550 verified individuals, currently using semaglutide for weight management, residing in various locations throughout the United States. The survey consisted of 22 questions, including a previously validated Food Noise Questionnaire (FNQ) and a self- reported demographic and mental wellbeing survey. The 550 respondents provided answers to all questions.

**Results:**
Mean age was 53 (SD: 10.8) years and 473 (86%) of the 550 respondents identified as female, 432 (79%) self-classified as Cauca- sian, 350 (64%) reported a weight of 92 kg or above when initiating semaglutide treatment, and 447 (81%) reported using semaglutide for at least 4 months. Overall, there was a reduction in the impact of food noise, as assessed by the five questions that comprised the FNQ (Table 1). Participants were asked to reflect on food noise prior to semaglutide treatment initiation and currently during their semaglutide treatment. A decline of 46% (95% CI: 41%-51%) in experiencing con- stant thoughts about food throughout the day, a decrease of 37% (95% CI: 33%-42%) in uncontrollable thoughts regarding food, and a 48% (95% CI: 44%-52%) reduction in excessive time spent thinking about food was observed. Additionally, participants reported a 40% (95% CI: 35%-44%) reduction in the negative impact of food-related thoughts and a 32% (95% CI: 28%-37%) decrease in how these thoughts dis- tracted them from completing everyday activities. Notably, 352 (64%), 417 (76%) and 438 (80%) of the respondents reported an improvement in mental health, self-confidence, and the development of heathier hab- its, respectively. Overall, most respondents, 457 individuals (83%), expressed satisfaction with their semaglutide treatment.

**Conclusion:**
The present findings indicate semaglutide may not only facilitate weight management but also alleviate cognitive distractions related to food and enhance the mental well-being of individuals living with obesity. Further research is warranted to confirm these results.

**Background and aims:**
Orforglipron is the first non-peptide GLP-1 RA in phase 3 development for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and weight management.

**Materials and methods:**
In this phase 3 double-blind, placebo-con- trolled 40-week study, participants with T2D treated with diet and exercise alone for at least 90 days prior to screening, HbA1c ≥7% (53 mmol/mol) to ≤9.5% (80 mmol/mol), and BMI ≥23.0 kg/m were randomized to daily oral orforglipron (3, 12, and 36 mg) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c. Key secondary endpoints included the incidence of partici- pants achieving HbA1c of <7% and ≤6.5%, change from baseline in fasting serum glucose (FSG), percent change from baseline in body weight, and serum lipids (non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides). Results are presented for the efficacy estimand, representing efficacy of treatment had all randomized participants remained on study drug for 40 weeks without initiating additional glucose lowering treatment.

**Results:**
559 participants (61.7% naïve to glucose-lowering medi- cations) were randomized with baseline mean age of 53 years, T2D duration of 4.4 years, HbA1c of 8.0% (63.8 mmol/mol), and body weight of 90.2 kg. The primary and all key secondary efficacy objec- tives of the trial were met: orforglipron was superior to placebo for changes from baseline to Week 40 in HbA1c and FSG, percent change in body weight, and serum lipids (Table). At week 40, mean HbA1c decreased to 6.7% (50.0 mmol/mol), 6.4% (46.4 mmol/mol), and 6.5% (47.9 mmol/mol) in the orforglipron 3, 12, and 36 mg groups, respec- tively, compared with 7.8% (62.2 mmol/mol) in the placebo group. An HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol) was reached by 73% (3 mg), 76% (12 mg) and 75% (36 mg) of orforglipron-treated participants, and up to 66% of participants achieved an HbA1c ≤6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in the orforglipron groups compared to 28% and 14% in the placebo group, respectively (p<.001). Near-normoglycemia (HbA1c <5.7% [39 mmol/ mol]) was achieved by up to 26% of participants from the orforglipron treatment groups versus 4% with placebo. A weight reduction of ≥5% was observed in 45%, 57%, and 64% of participants treated with orfor- glipron 3, 12, and 36mg, respectively, versus 19% of those treated with placebo. The most common adverse events were GI related, primar- ily reported as mild or moderate in severity that subsided over time. Discontinuation of orforglipron due to adverse events (primarily GI- related) was 5.6% (3 mg), 4.4% (12 mg) and 7.8% (36 mg) versus 1.4% with placebo. No severe hypoglycemia was reported, and no hepatic or pancreatic safety signals were observed.

**Conclusion:**
Orforglipron monotherapy in patients with early T2D sig- nificantly improved glycemic control and reduced body weight with a safety profile consistent with the GLP-1 RA class.

2. Korea, Hanmi Pharm. Co., Ltd., Hwaseong-si, Republic of Korea.

**Background and aims:**
Injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have revolutionized the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity by harnessing the metabolic benefits of endogenous GLP-1. Despite their remarkable efficacy, the requirement for parenteral administration limits accessibility, conveni- ence, and long-term patient adherence. To overcome the limitations in the oral delivery of peptide-based GLP-1RAs, we developed a selec- tive, potent, and G protein-biased small-molecule GLP-1RA and dem- onstrated its pharmacological profile, promising efficacy, and safety in various animal models.

**Materials and methods:**
To demonstrate the potent, G protein biased- agonism of HM101460, cAMP accumulation and β-arrestin recruit- ment assays were conducted for human GLP-1R. Potential off-target effects were also evaluated against hGLP-2R, hGIPR, and hGCGR. stability and CYP450 inhibition assay were evaluated. Pharma- cokinetic properties after intravenous and oral dosing were evaluated in ICR mice. Efficacy was evaluated by ipGTT, and body weight loss in hGLP-1R knock-in DIO mice. Safety and tolerability were assessed via hERG and repeat-dose toxicology, cardiovascular, and CNS safety studies in rodents.

**Results:**
HM101460 exhibited more potent agonistic activity on hGLP- 1R (cAMP, EC = 0.2 nM), compared to other small molecule-based GLP-1RAs. Its G protein-biased agonism was confirmed by minimal β-arrestin recruitment, suggesting reduced receptor internalization and the potential for sustained efficacy. Moreover, HM101460 showed no detectable activity on hGLP-2R, hGIPR, or hGCGR, supporting its high target selectivity. In stability assays, HM101460 exhib- its high metabolic stability, remaining 91% after 30 min. in micro- somal incubation and 100% after 2h in plasma compared to initial conc. Furthermore, no inhibition of various CYP isoforms were observed. HM101460 exhibited low clearance and moderate volume of distribution and showed high oral bioavailability. Cardiac safety was demonstrated by the absence of hERG inhibition at HM101460 concentrations up to 50 μM. In DIO hGLP-1R mice, HM101460 sig- nificantly improved glucose tolerance and induced robust weight loss with no adverse effects observed on cardiovascular, respiratory, or CNS function.

**Conclusion:**
Based on its novel pharmacological profiles, includ- ing potent and selective intrinsic activity, G protein-biased agonism, favorable metabolic stability, high oral bioavailability, and a demon- strated safety profile, HM101460 elicited robust glucose- and body- weight-lowering effects. These findings support the potential of HM101460 as an oral GLP-1RA candidate for clinical development.

**Background and aims:**
Mitochondria are central to systemic energy homeostasis. Preclinical studies demonstrate that mitochondrial stress confers protection against diet-induced obesity. In line with this, emerging evidence indicates that individuals with primary mitochon- drial disorders (MitoD) frequently present with lean, hypermetabolic phenotypes and remarkably low obesity prevalence, thus providing a unique human model for investigating mechanisms underlying obesity resistance. Here, we conducted comprehensive metabolic studies to characterize the physiological mechanisms driving the typically lean and obesity resistant phenotype observed in individuals with MitoD.

**Materials and methods:**
In a cross-sectional study design, individuals with MitoD (n=15) were compared to healthy controls (n=15) indi- vidually matched for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity level. Participants underwent comprehensive metabolic phe- notyping under both fasting and postprandial conditions, including i) assessments of resting energy expenditure and substrate oxidation via indirect calorimetry, ii) evaluation of energy intake through meal test, and iii) quantification of appetite sensations using visual analogue scales. Blood and skeletal muscle biopsy samples were obtained for quantitative analyses of energy balance-regulating cytokines and mitochondrial function (high-resolution respirometry in isolated mitochondria and permeabilized muscle fibers).

**Results:**
Compared to matched controls, individuals with MitoD displayed elevated resting energy expenditure (+4.2 kcal/day/kg fat-free-mass; =0.007) and reduced energy intake (-235 kcal; =0.018), while appetite sensations remained unaltered. Skel- etal muscle mitochondrial analyses revealed oxidative phosphorylation defects in MitoD; however, mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratio and respiratory control ratio) and leak respiration were unaffected. Plasma concentrations of the mitochondrial stress-responsive cytokines GDF15 and FGF21 were approximately 2-fold elevated in MitoD compared to controls.

**Conclusion:**
These findings demonstrate that individuals with inherited mitochondrial defects exhibit increased resting energy expenditure and decreased energy intake relative to age-, sex-, BMI-, and physical activity-matched healthy controls. These alterations occurred independently of changes in muscle mitochondrial efficiency but were associated with elevated circulating levels of GDF15 and FGF21, estab- lished neuroendocrine mediators of appetite and energy expenditure. We propose that the coordinated anorexigenic and autonomic action elicited by enhanced dual GDF15/FGF21 signaling may contribute to a negative shift in energy balance, ultimately promoting constitutional leanness and obesity resistance in individuals with inherited mitochon- drial defects.

3. Health, Auckland, New Zealand, Counterweight Limited, London,
4. UK, Statistics, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.

**Background and aims:**
Meal replacement low energy diets (MR-LED) can induce clinically meaningful weight loss, and is generally used for achieving remission of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) or pre- bariatric surgery intervention. However, their acceptability and utility in those with higher body weight who have been declined bariatric surgery is unknown, particularly in ethnically diverse populations living in low- socioeconomic communities.

**Materials and methods:**
Te Mana Ki Tua (TMKT) is a publicly- funded medical weight management service established in 2023 in South Auckland, New Zealand with endocrinologist, dietitian, and health coach staff to complement a long-standing bariatric surgery programme. The 12-month model of care was group-based and uti- lised either Optifast (initial group) or Counterweight-Plus programme (11 groups), during 12-weeks meal replacement, 12-weeks stepped food reintroduction then 24 weeks weight loss maintenance. Lists of adults declined public-funded bariatric surgery and other secondary care referrals were triaged for invitation to an information session about MR-LED. Basic eligibility criteria included BMI>35kg/m with T2D or other significant weight related complications or requirement for pre-operative weight loss. Weight change was assessed for those who attended a clinic visit at 12-weeks (completers), or the last weight measured before 12-weeks was used (LWCF). Baseline and 12-week assessments included T2D status (HbA1c, medication use), Kings Obesity Staging Score (KOSS), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ9), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item GAD-7), binge eating (Binge Eating Disorder screener BEDS-7) and wellbeing (Hua Oranga HO-20 designed for Māori health outcomes). Changes in continuous and categorical outcome variables from baseline to 12-weeks were compared using paired sample t-tests or chi-squared tests, respectively.

**Results:**
Of 1172 patients triaged, 482(41%) met eligibility criteria, and 408 were able to be contacted. Of these 225 were interested, and 155(61%) attended an information session, of whom 128 (51% Pacific, 22% Māori ethnicity) started MR-LED between July 2023 and July 2024. Mean (SD) baseline weight was 145.0[38.6]kg, and BMI 49.9[11.3]kg/m .111(87%) had been declined for bariatric surgery, 93(73%) had T2D (baseline HbA1c 67[20]mol/mol, 2 on insulin). Data were available for 97/128 completers at 12-weeks. Mean weight change [SD] was -10.9[7.8]kg, p<0.05, for completers, -8.7 [7.7] kg, p<0.001, using LWCF. HbA1c decreased from 63[15] to 56[15]mmol/ mol (p<0.01) with less diabetes medication use 2.0[1.3] to 0.9[1.1], p<0.001. 25/56(45%) of those with T2D had HbA1c<50mmol/mol at 12-weeks. Depressive, anxiety and binge-eating scores decreased (PHQ9: 9.4[5.8] to 5.4[4.9], GAD7: 6.6[5.4] to 4.1[4.4], BEDS7: 4.2([4.8] to 2.3[3.8], all p<0.001), HO-20 wellbeing increased in physi- cal, spiritual and social domains (p<0.001). KOSS fell from 7.3[2.8] to 5.6[3.1], p<0.001.

**Conclusion:**
Early data demonstrates that a group-based MR-LED is an acceptable and effective option for achieving clinically significant weight loss and comorbidity improvement among adults with higher body weights who were unable to have bariatric surgery.

**Background and aims:**
Duodenal jejunal bypass liner (DJBL) is a 60 cm impermeable sleeve endoscopically implanted into the first part of the small intestine such that food passes through it without coming into contact with the small intestinal mucosa. It is removed endoscopically after about 1-year, and it has been shown to reduce weight and improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. In view of uncertainty over benefit-risk ratio of DJBL, in 2017, an independent, secure, online, international registry was established under the auspices of the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists (ABCD). As many of the serious adverse events (SAE) associated with DJBL occur during the last 3-months of treatment, we aimed to assess whether reducing the period of implantation to 9-months would reduce SAE.

**Materials and methods:**
DJBL safety and efficacy data were entered into the ABCD registry from patients worldwide. We compared HbA1c and weight at 9 vs 12-month implantation.

**Results:**
As of June 2025, the registry had 1298 patients of whom 258 (mean ± SD age 49.5 ± 13.3 years, 46.5% male, BMI 39.6 ± 6.9 kg/m ) had both 9- and 12-month data entered. DJBL had significant impact on weight and HbA1c (Table). However, during DJBL treatment, there was no difference between the mean±SD reduction in HbA1c at 9-months (1.5±1.7%) vs 12-months (1.5±1.7%) (p=0.571). There was little difference between the mean±SD weight loss at 9-months (12.2±8.1kg) vs 12-months (13.1±8.6kg) (p=0.005). The higher the baseline HbA1c, the greater the reduction but no significant difference between 9- and 12-months (Table). In the full registry, 60/1298 (4.6%) experienced serious adverse events (SAE). 22/60 (36.7%) SAE would have been avoided by removal at 9-months (12 liver abscess, 8 GI bleed, one cholecystitis, one surgical removal required as liner was dis- placed). It was particularly noteworthy that 12/18 (66.6%) liver abscess SAE would have been avoided by removal of DJBL at 9-months. All SAE patients made a full recovery.

**Conclusion:**
This data from the DJBL worldwide registry demonstrates the considerable benefits of DJBL on HbA1c and weight. It also sug- gests that most benefits are achieved in 9-months and reducing the recommended treatment period from 12- to 9-months would reduce SAE, especially liver abscess SAE.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity-related insulin resistance (IR) is central to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunc- tion-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Emerging evidence suggests that impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), but not in sub- cutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), is a characteristic of IR in individuals with obesity and MASLD. In parallel, hepatic mitochondrial respiration adapts to increased substrate availability by enhanced OXPHOS capac- ity. We hypothesized that surgical weight loss initiates tissue-specific changes in mitochondrial plasticity, thereby contributing to improve- ments in insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis.

**Materials and methods:**
All participants underwent detailed meta- bolic phenotyping before bariatric surgery and again before a revi- sional and adjunctive post-bariatric surgery (mean follow-up 26±18 months). Biopsies of VAT, SAT, and liver were obtained during both interventions. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was assessed using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, and adipose tissue IR using the Adipo-IR index. MASLD was graded histologically. Maximum coupled fatty acid-dependent OXPHOS capacity in SAT, VAT, and liver was measured using high-resolution respirometry. Citrate synthase activity (CSA) was measured spectrophotometrically. Statistical analyses were performed using linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for age, sex, and time lag between surgeries.

**Results:**
At baseline, 16 persons (43±11 yrs; 75% female) had class 3 obesity (BMI 52±9 kg/m²) and featured insulin resistance (M-value 3.4±1.3 kg*min *ml , Adipo-IR 8.1±4.1 a.u.), hepatic steatosis (25±6.5%) and subclinical inflammation (hsCRP 1.0±0.8 mg/dl). After surgery, participants lost 31% of body mass (p<0.001), along with 67% increase in M-value (p=0.01) and 59% decreased Adipo-IR (p<0.01) and significant improvements in hepatic lipid content and hsCRP (both p<0.01). Interestingly, OXPHOS increased in VAT (+113%, p<0.01) and SAT (+44%, p<0.05), but not in liver. CSA increased in VAT (+161%, p<0.001), but not SAT and even decreased in liver (-43%, p<0.01). Mitochondrial efficiency (substrate control ratio) improved in both VAT and liver (+13% and +10%, p<0.05) but not SAT.

**Conclusion:**
These data indicate that the weight-loss induced improve- ment in insulin resistance and MASLD specifically relates to beneficial mitochondrial adaptations in visceral adipose tissue and liver.

**GenSci156, a potent bi-specific antibody targeting ActRIIA/B and GIPR for obesity treatment without causing muscle loss**

G. Sun, Chu, S. Sun, R. Hu, S. Liang, L. Kang, G. Xia, L. Jin

**Background and aims:**
The current treatment for obesity, like Gluca- gon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, producing remarkable weight loss through reducing food intake while the muscle loss could account for up to 40%. Bimagrumab is a phase II clinical asset target- ing activin type II receptors (ActRII). It is a promising way to achieve high quality weight loss by inducing skeletal muscle hypertrophy and reducing fat mass without regulating satiety. However, overall body weight loss might be compromised due to strong muscle gain function. Antagonism of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) could reduce fat mass through modulating adipocyte function. Here we would like to evaluate the combinational effects on fat and muscle mass by targeting ActRIIA/B and GIPR. Also, we have devel- oped a bi-specific antibody drug GenSci156 to explore the possibilities of targeting both receptors to achieve a high-quality weight loss.

**Materials and methods:**
In studies, receptor binding assays were used to investigate the binding activities of GenSci156 across species. Ligand blocking activities of GenSci156 were determined by HEK293/SBE-Luc reporter assays and GIPR HTRF cAMP assays using human activin A and myostatin and GIP as ligands respectively. In efficacy studies, we adopted diet induced obesity (DIO) mouse model to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of GenSci156 includ- ing weight loss and body composition modification. We also assessed pharmacokinetics of GenSci156 in mouse studies.

**Results:**
In receptor binding assays, GenSci156 showed high affinity to ActRIIA, ActRIIB and GIPR proteins (KD=6.78E-09M (hActRIIA), 2.96E-09M (hActRIIB), 1.85E-08M (hGIPR)). In HEK293/SBE-Luc reporter assays, GenSci156 completely blocked activities induced by ActRII ligands, activin A ­(IC =0.08nM) or myostatin ­(IC =0.12nM), with ­IC comparable to Bimagrumab (activin A ­IC =0.10nM, myostatin ­IC =0.04nM). In GIPR HTRF cAMP assays, GenSci156 exhibited great blocking activities stimulated by GIP ­(IC =2.67nM). In DIO mice, two weeks treatment with GenSci156, achieved more than 20% reduction in fat mass and 5% increases in lean mass. As a comparison, the fat mass reducing effects of Bimagrumab at the same dose was 10%. As a result, GenSci156 caused a significant inhibition on weight growth by 5.1% compared to vehicle controls. No signifi- cant changes in food intake were noticed between groups. GenSci156 showed a good pk profile with half-life similar to a typical antibody drug. Finally, GenSci156 was proved to be safe and well-tolerated in the mouse studies.

**Conclusion:**
We have proved for the first time by blocking ActRIIA/B and GIPR activities can lead to synergistic fat mass loss while preserv- ing muscle mass. GenSci156, which is a bi-specific antibody simulta- neously inhibiting signaling pathways of the above two receptors has demonstrated a remarkable fat mass loss while still maintaining weight reduction. Therefore, GenSci156 deserves to be further developed to become a promising treatment option in addition to the current satiety control drugs for high quality weight control.

**Left atrial dysfunction in class III obesity: a pilot study using two- dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography**

M. Pec, M. Samos, M. Mokan

**Background and aims:**
The relationship between obesity and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is complex. Obe- sity imposes increased stress on the heart, resulting in a variety of cardiac problems, including left atrial dysfunction. Chronic inflam- mation, increased preload and afterload, and pulmonary hyperten- sion are commonly observed in obese patients. As part of a complex echocardiographic examination, the two-dimensional speckle tracking (2D ST) method is a significant tool for assessing dysfunction of the left atrium. Our study aimed to compare left atrial function using the 2D ST method in patients with class III obesity and a control group. The following parameters were observed: Reservoir Left Atrial Strain (R-LAS), Conduit Time (CT), and Contractile Displacement (CD).

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a pilot, observational and pro- spective study that included 20 patients with class III obesity (Body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m²) and a control group of 19 healthy indi- viduals with a BMI of 20-25 kg/m². The parameters were measured using transthoracic echocardiography (Vivid® E95, GE Medical Sys- tems, Milwaukee, WI, USA), which was performed by two experienced cardiologists trained in echocardiography.

**Results:**
The study cohort included 4 men and 16 women, with an average age of 42.4 years (19-73). In the study group, the mean BMI was 47.69 ± 8.86 kg/m². The control group consisted of 4 men and 15 women. The average age was 27.2 ± 3.7 years, and the average BMI in the control group was 22.48 kg/m². There was a significant difference in R-LAS (29.9 ± 7.0 vs. 45.0 ± 11.7; p<0.001) and CT (-16.8 ± 5.89 vs. -29.7 ± 8.71; p<0.001) between the obese patients and the control group. No significant difference was observed in CD values (-13.2 ± 4.77 vs. -15.1 ± 6.28; p=0.305).

**Conclusion:**
The R-LAS and CT parameters were significantly reduced in patients with class III obesity compared to the control group.

**Background and aims:**
Remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is becom- ing feasible with modern treatments, including GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA). However, the definition of T2D remission is debated, its frequency and duration under routine care is poorly known, as are its long-term benefits. Here, we explored frequency, clinical characteris- tics, and outcomes associated with various definitions of T2D remis- sion after initiation of GLP-1RA.

**Materials and methods:**
We used data from a multicentre retrospec- tive cohort study (GLIMPLES) including new-users of GLP-1RA. Participants with T2D were followed since initiation of GLP-1RA to the last observation, up to August 2023. We employed 4 definitions of remission: 1) Return of HbA1c to less than 6.5% that persisted for at least 3 months in the absence of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy; 2) As in 1, but in the absence of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy except GLP-1RA; 3) As in 1, but in the absence of new glucose-low- ering pharmacotherapy compared to the baseline; 4) As in 1, but irre- spectively of the glucose-lowering medication regimen. Participants were divided in two groups (with/without remission). We evaluated fre- quency of remission types, duration, associated features, and outcomes, including changes over time in HbA1c, body weight, and incidence of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization).

**Results:**
We included 14,141 participants. GLP-1RA were distributed as follows: 50.5% dulaglutide; 24.9% liraglutide; 11.7% semaglutide; 11.0% exenatide; 1.4% lixisenatide. Patients were 60% men, 60 year old, with a diabetes duration of about 10 year, BMI 32 kg/m , baseline HbA1c 8.1%. The median observation was 4 years. Remission frequen- cies were: definition 1) 5.8%; definition 2) 6.2%; definition 3) 12.2%; definition 4) 18.3%. The median time to remission was ~6 months after GLP-1RA initiation, irrespectively of the definition. Duration was shorter for remission 1 and 2 (median 5-6 months) than for remission 3 and 4 (median 9-10 months). Factors associated with remission were similar across definitions (shorter diabetes duration, higher BMI, lower complication burden, and less use of glucose-lowering medications). Remission was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful long-term benefits on HbA1c (-1.1%) and body weight (-3.4 kg) that were sustained over time. Systolic blood pressure (-2.3 mm Hg) and serum triglycerides (-15.3 mg/dl) also improved more in the remission group. Rates of new-onset microangiopathy were sig- nificantly lower in participants with remission 1, 2 and 3 (adjusted HR from 0.84 to 0.88). The incidence of cardiovascular events was lower in participants with remission 3 after full adjustment (HR 0.65; 95% C.I. 0.48 to 0.88).

**Conclusion:**
Remission of T2D after initiation GLP-1RA is not a rare event, its frequency and duration varying substantially by remission definition. When achieved, GLP-1RA-induced remission of T2D is associated with durable metabolic improvements up to 4 years and, possibly, fewer cardiovascular events.

**Background and aims:**
Endogenous glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) reduces postprandial bone resorption, a phenom- enon mimicked during short-term infusion of exogenous GIP. It is well known that the hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes is accompanied by a reduced insulinotropic effect of GIP. Patients with type 2 diabetes also suffer from an increased risk of fractures, but the effect of long-term GIP infusion on bone homeostasis remain unknown. Here, we report predefined secondary endpoints on bone turnover markers from a study investigating the effects of a six-week continuous s.c. infusion of GIP alone and in combination with once-weekly s.c. semaglutide treatment.

**Materials and methods:**
61 individuals (18-74 years, BMI ≥ 25 kg/ m , ­HbA 48-91 mmol/mol) with type 2 diabetes were included in this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. The participants were randomised 1:1:1:1 to receive either s.c. semaglutide (0.25 mg for the first four weeks, then up-titrated to 0.5 mg) or placebo injections once weekly for eight weeks followed by a six-week add-on treatment with continuous s.c. infusion of GIP (16 pmol/kg/min) or pla- cebo (saline 9 mg/ml). Changes in fasting plasma levels of bone turno- ver markers C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) (bone resorption) and procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) (bone formation) from week 0 to week 14 were evaluated and com- pared between 1) the placebo+GIP arm and the placebo+placebo arm and 2) the semaglutide+GIP arm and the semaglutide+placebo arm. Differences were estimated using a constrained linear mixed model.

**Results:**
Differences in the change of fasting levels of CTX were 0.008 ng/ml (95% CI -0.07 to 0.08, =0.83) (placebo+GIP vs placebo+placebo) and -0.04 ng/ml (CI -0.12 to 0.03, =0.25) (semaglutide+GIP vs semaglutide+placebo). Differences in the change of fasting levels of P1NP were 1.49 ng/ml (CI -3.41 to 6.39, =0.55) (placebo+GIP vs placebo+placebo) and -5.34 ng/ml (CI -9.94 to -0.74, =0.02) (semaglutide+GIP vs semaglutide+placebo). Plasma levels are presented in Figure 1.

**Conclusion:**
Six weeks of s.c. infusion of GIP in combination with semaglutide decreased P1NP but had no detectable effects on P1NP when administered alone. GIP had no effects on fasting levels of CTX.

3. Japan, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA.

**Background and aims:**
This 12-week multiple ascending dose study evaluated the safety and tolerability of the long-acting selective amylin receptor agonist eloralintide in Japanese participants with overweight.

**Materials and methods:**
64 participants (mean age 38.7 years, BMI 30.1 kg/m , 27% female) were assigned to one of four cohorts in a 3:1 ratio within each cohort to receive a once weekly subcutaneous dose of eloralintide or placebo for a total duration of 12 weeks with up to 10 weeks of follow-up after the last dose. The primary endpoints of inter- est were safety and tolerability. Treatment effects on anthropometrics were also assessed.

**Results:**
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred with higher frequency in eloralintide treatment groups than placebo (Table). The most common TEAEs were decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis. The incidence of gastrointestinal-related TEAEs were low except for dose 3 group. There were no injection site reactions. There were no clinically significant changes in SBP, DBP, and PR from baseline. There were no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory parameters, including liver enzymes, cortisol, and lipids. AUC(0-∞) and Cmax after the last dose increased with dose with geometric mean t1/2 of 343 to 356 hours. Placebo-adjusted percent change from base- line of body weight was dose-dependent, ranging from 7.5% to -12.8% at 12 weeks. Based on appetite VAS, hunger and prospective food consumption decreased, while satiety and fullness were increased with all doses of eloralintide.

**Conclusion:**
In Japanese participants with overweight or obesity, the long-acting selective amylin receptor agonist eloralintide was safe and well tolerated, and with clinically meaningful body weight loss. Phar- macokinetics support once weekly subcutaneous dosing. Eloralintide may be an important option for weight management in people with overweight or obesity, with and without diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Zovaglutide, a novel ultra long-acting gluca- gon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has shown favorable tolerability profiles and sustainable weight loss with monthly subcu- taneous administration in phase 1 study. The objective of this phase 2 study was to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of zova- glutide in overweight or obese adults without diabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study was conducted in Chinese adults with overweight (24 kg/m ≤ body-mass index [BMI] <28 kg/m ) accompa- nied by at least one co-morbidity or obesity (BMI≥28 kg/m ). Eligible participants were randomized (3:3:2:2:2) to receive zovaglutide 80 mg or 160 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W), zovaglutide 80 mg or 160 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W), or matched placebo. The treatment dura- tion was 24 weeks, including a 6 or 8-week dose escalation phase with a 2-week interval between each dose up-titration. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in weight after 24 weeks of treatment.

**Results:**
A total of 303 participants were randomized. The baseline characteristics were generally balanced across all treatment groups, of which 50.5% were female, mean age was 32.6 years and mean BMI was 34.4 kg/m . All zovaglutide groups showed statistically significant greater weight reduction versus placebo at week 24, with no plateau observed. Weight loss in the 160 mg Q4W group was comparable to the 80 mg Q2W group, and greater than the 80 mg Q4W group. Significant reductions in waist circumference and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors were also observed. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) and decreased appetite, which were mostly mild to moderate in severity, and primarily occurred during dose escalation. The gastrointestinal disorders profiles were similar between the 160 mg Q4W and 80 mg Q2W groups.

**Conclusion:**
In overweight or obese participants, once-monthly sub- cutaneous zovaglutide demonstrated clinically meaningful weight loss with favorable tolerability and safety profiles over 24 weeks. These promising data support further clinical development of zovaglutide as a monthly injectable treatment for overweight/obesity.

**Background and aims:**
Utreglutide (UTG, GL0034), a potent glucagon- like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated good safety profile after single and multiple ascending doses in a phase 1 program. A significant and sustained weight loss was observed after 10-week treatment with UTG in comparison to placebo. Here, we present safety and efficacy data of phase 1b/2a study of UTG in individuals with obesity and MAFLD.

**Materials and methods:**
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled parallel group multicenter study 48 participants both male and females, aged 18 to 70 years old with a BMI≥30 kg/m and liver fat content≥10% as assessed by MRI-proton density fat fraction (PDFF) were randomized (3:1) to subcutaneous UTG doses with dose titration period (2×0.4, 4×0.8, 4×1.6 mg) of 10 weeks and fixed dose period (2.4 mg) of 3 weeks; or placebo (PBO) once weekly for 13 weeks. Safety, tolerability, and key efficacy along with exploratory biomarkers were assessed at baseline, week 13/14 and follow-up visit at week 17 [End of Study (EoS)]. The data of stratified participants with BMI<40 kg/m and ­HbA ≥6.0% for treatment group and for placebo only BMI<40 kg/m is included. The biomarkers assessed are BMI, body weight (BW), ­HbA , glucose, C-peptide, systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate (HR), amylase and lipase levels.

**Results:**
After 13 weeks of treatment with UTG, body weight reduction from BL in subjects with obesity and ­HbA ≥6.0% was 6.8 kg at week 14 ( <0.001) which increased to 7.7 kg by EoS ( <0.001). Concur- rently the BMI change was -2.4 and -2.8 kg/m respectively ( <0.001). The treatment resulted in robust reduction of ­HbA levels, 0.75% at W14 and 0.71% at EoS respectively ( <0.001) along with glucose. C-peptide levels increased by 9.5% at W14 and decreased by 11.0% at W17 (Table). Three-fourth of the participants were non-diabetic (<5.7% ­HbA ) at W14 from prediabetic/diabetic status at baseline. The SBP significantly reduced at W14 and W17 ( <0.05) with no appreciable change in the HR. Further, the amylase and lipase levels were also unaffected ( >0.05). The most frequent TEAEs were mainly gastrointestinal disorders consistent with GLP-1RA class.

**Conclusion:**
In individuals with obesity and MASLD, once weekly UTG dosing for 13 weeks was well-tolerated and demonstrated clini- cally relevant and robust changes in ­HbA , body weight and biomarkers of cardio-metabolism, which may confer additional cardiovascular ben- efits to individuals with type 2 diabetes along with obesity and MAFLD.

2. nology, Luoyang, China, First Medical Center of Chinese PLA Gen-

**Background and aims:**
Mazdutide, a dual GLP-1R/GCGR agonist, significantly improved uric acid nephropathy in rats in our previous study. This study aims to further investigate the underlying mechanisms of its therapeutic effects.

**Materials and methods:**
1. Eighty male SD rats were randomly divided into eight groups (n=10): blank control (CON), high-fat diet control (HFD), uric acid nephropathy (UN), Mazdutide low/medium/high- dose groups (0.025/0.05/0.075 mg·kg ¹), semaglutide group (GLP- 1RA, mg·kg ¹), and allopurinol group (ALL, 25 mg·kg ¹). Except for the CON group, all rats were fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks. Uric acid nephropathy was induced using adenine (100 mg·kg ¹) and potassium oxonate (1000 mg·kg ¹), followed by 18 days of drug intervention. General condition, renal pathology, renal function, and oxidative stress markers were recorded and assessed.2. Transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics were used to identify differentially expressed RNAs, proteins, and phosphoproteins in HFD, UN, and medium-dose groups, followed by GO/KEGG analysis.3. HK-2 cells were treated with uric acid (200 μg·ml ¹) to establish an in vitro injury model and divided into six groups: control, model, and treatments with Mazdutide (1.25 μg·ml ¹), semaglutide (6.25 μg·ml ¹), allopurinol (100 μM), and GCGRA (5 μg·ml ¹). Cell viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress mark- ers (ROS, LDH, GSH, ­Fe ) were assessed via CCK-8, flow cytom- etry, and ELISA.4. RT-qPCR and Western blotting were performed to validate the expression of key genes and proteins (FTL-1, FTH-1, SLC7A11, GPX4, ASK1) in both kidney tissues and HK-2 cells.

**Results:**
1. Moderate-dose Mazdutide (0.05 mg·kg ¹) significantly reduced SUA, CREA, and BUN, while increasing T-SOD and GSH levels. HE staining showed improved renal histopathology, Masson staining revealed reduced fibrosis, and TUNEL staining demonstrated decreased renal cell apoptosis.2. Transcriptomics and proteom- ics revealed enrichment in apoptosis, ECM, TGF-β, and ferroptosis pathways. Mazdutide significantly inhibited ASK1 phosphorylation (P<0.001) per proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis.3. Uric acid significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis, ROS, LDH, ­Fe levels while decreasing GSH (P<0.0001). Mazdutide, semaglutide, allopurinol, and GCGRA significantly improved viability (P<0.0001). Mazdutide also reversed apoptosis, ROS, LDH, ­Fe and GSH changes (P<0.0001).4. In kidney tissue, Mazdutide (medium dose) significantly upregulated FTL-1, FTH-1, SLC7A11, and GPX4, and downregulated p-ASK1 (P<0.0001 vs. UN). In HK-2 cells, Mazdu- tide significantly increased GPX4, SLC7A11, FTH-1, and FTL-1 (P<0.01) and reduced ACSL4 and p-ASK1 expression (P<0.0001 vs. model). These changes were reversed after Mazdutide treatment.

**Conclusion:**
1. Subcutaneous injection of Mazdutide every 3 days can improve uric acid nephropathy in SD rats.2. Administration of Mazdutide to HK-2 cells can improve cell viability reduced by uric acid administration and reduce cell apoptosis.3. Mazdutide can inhibit ASK1 phosphorylation and the SLC7A11-GPX4 ferroptosis axis, thereby improving uric acid nephropathy.

6. Metabolism Inst, Hanover, NH, USA, University College London,

**Background and aims:**
Medications with GLP-1 receptor agonist activity have demonstrated cardiovascular benefit in people with obesity and elevated risk of cardiometabolic events. We sought to determine the prognostic value of multi-organ imaging in predicting the risk of incident type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular hospitalisa- tion (CVH), major adverse liver-related events (LRE), and all-cause mortality (ACM) and of different treatment allocations.

**Materials and methods:**
MRI data from contributors to the UK Biobank (UKB) were evaluated by a standardised computer algorithm to assess cardiometabolic organ pathologies; 14 metrics including pancreatic fat, liver fat, skeletal muscle (SM), left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), and MASH disease activity in liver (by cT1). Obesity was defined by BMI>=30 kg/m and clinical obesity as obesity with an ICD-10 diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction (modi- fied 2025 Lancet Obesity Commission criteria). Hazard ratios (HR) derived from multivariate regression were adjusted for age, sex, BMI and comorbidities to optimise combinations of prognostic biomark- ers. We used published outcome data to model tirzepatide treatment and estimate the number of people needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 death.

**Results:**
Median age of 23087 UKB participants was 64 yrs, 50% female, 5% with T2D,18% with obesity and 31% with clinical obe- sity. Elevated liver cT1 >800ms, liver fat >5% and pancreatic fat >6%, were independently associated with elevated risk of develop- ing T2D in people with or without clinical obesity (HR 27, 95% CI 16-47 vs 12, 5.3-27). Elevated liver cT1, heart failure (regardless of LVEF), clinical obesity and hypertension were associated with risk of CVH (5.4, 2.7-11). Risk of LRE was associated with elevated cT1, SM<74/120 (F/M)cm and T2D. In those with T2D, high cT1 was associated with LRE (18, 6.1-53) more strongly than decreased SM was (9, 2.0-40). Reduced LVEF, elevated liver cT1, low SM and obesity were all associated with risk of ACM. In people with obesity, reduced LVEF and high liver cT1 were more strongly associated with ACM (5.1, 1.3-21) than low SM was (2.4, 1.1-5.2). Modelling treat- ment with tirzepatide revealed that in people with obesity, 0.63% deaths could be prevented, with NNT of 148. Incorporation of imag- ing metrics decreased NNT to 117 with high liver cT1 and to 24 with high cT1 and low LVEF.

**Conclusion:**
In a large-scale prospective study, multi-organ MR- based imaging improved risk stratification for cardiometabolic disease in people with obesity. Personalised risk stratification with MR imaging could target treatments to patients most likely to benefit, thus producing the most effective and cost-effective care to the greatest overall public health benefit.

**Lac-Phe enhances hepatic energy homeostasis via pparα-mediated fatty acid oxidation**

W. Zou

1. Peking university first hospital, Beijing, China, Department of Endo-

**Background and aims:**
N-lactoyl-phenylalanine (Lac-Phe) is an exercise-inducible metabolite that circulates in the blood. Although previous studies have demonstrated its role in suppressing feeding behavior and preventing obesity, whether and how Lac-Phe modulates liver metabolism remains unclear. In this study, we aim to investi- gate the impact of Lac-Phe on energy metabolism and its underlying molecular mechanisms, with a particular focus on liver tissue, using a mouse model.

**Materials and methods:**
Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to four experimental groups based on diet (normal chow diet [NCD] or high-fat diet [HFD]) and treatment (saline injection or Lac-Phe injec- tion). To characterize the effects of Lac-Phe on hepatic energy metab- olism, we conducted liver proteomics analysis. Primary hepatocytes were cultured to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Lac- Phe regulates energy metabolism in vitro. Additionally, We performed immunoblot analysis, seahorse metabolic assays and comprehensive metabolic assessments to evaluate changes in energy metabolism. Molecular docking and dual-luciferase reporter assays were employed to determine the interaction between Lac-Phe and its target genes. The functional relevance of these target genes was further explored through hepatocyte-specific knockout experiments in mice.

**Results:**
Lac-Phe significantly mitigated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced systemic weight gain, reduced energy expenditure, insulin resistance, glucose dysregulation, and liver steatosis in mice. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that the most significantly altered proteins were associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated recep- tor (PPAR) signaling pathways, which are closely linked to Fatty acid metabolic process. Furthermore, molecular docking results demon- strated that Lac-Phe binds directly to PPARα. In vitro studies indicated that Lac-Phe activates hepatic PPARα target genes, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a), thereby enhancing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Hepatocyte-specific knockout of PPARα partially reversed the beneficial effects of Lac-Phe on energy metabo- lism, including the reduction in FAO.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings reveal a novel role for Lac-Phe as a positive regulator of hepatic energy metabolism, partly through the activation of PPARα-mediated fatty acid oxidation. These results highlight the potential of Lac-Phe as a therapeutic candidate for hepatic metabolic disorders, pending further validation. This study provides new insights into the potential of Lac-Phe as a key player in maintaining liver energy homeostasis and combating metabolic diseases.

**Background and aims:**
Physical inactivity has emerged as a major risk factor for chronic metabolic disorders in modern society, while regular exercise confers metabolic benefits through the generation of metabolites. Despite these observations, the precise mechanisms underlying exercise training (ExT) - mediated regulation of energy metabolism remain incompletely elucidated. As the central metabolic organ coordinating both energy homeostasis and tryptophan catabo- lism, the liver represents a critical target for ExT-induced metabolic adaptations. In this study, we aim to determine the effect of ExT on tryptophan metabolism and elaborate its underlying mechanisms of maintaining energy homeostasis.

**Materials and methods:**
Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were ran- domly assigned to four groups: normal control group (NC), ExT group (NC+ExT), high-fat diet group (HF) and high-fat diet with ExT group (HF+ExT). After 6 weeks intervention, glucose and lipid metabolism parameters were assessed. To systematically characterize the effects of exercise training on hepatic energy metabolism, we performed unbi- ased metabolomic and proteomic analyses of liver tissues. Additionally, We performed immunoblot analysis, seahorse metabolic assays and comprehensive metabolic assessments to evaluate changes in energy metabolism. Through combined in vivo and in vitro approaches, we systematically investigated exercise-induced modulation of trypto- phan catabolic pathways and the functional significance of tryptophan metabolism in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Pharmacological validation via intraperitoneal administration confirmed the bioactivity of candi- date metabolites. Furthermore, AAV8-mediated hepatocyte-specific gene knockdown established the causal role of our target gene in energy metabolism regulation.

**Results:**
Our study revealed that voluntary wheel running exercise ameliorated metabolic disorders triggered by a high-fat diet, encom- passing obesity, the impairment of glucose tolerance, and hepatic lipid deposition. And we found that following ExT, liver 3-hydroxy- anthranilic acid (3-HAA) and Anthranilic acid (AA) decline while kynurenic acid (KYNA) increases. We identified kynurenine ami- notransferase 1 (KAT1) as the key regulatory enzyme mediating this metabolic shift, with its expression being markedly upregulated in hepatocytes following ExT. Proteomics identified widespread activa- tion of mitochondrial pathways. Administration of KYNA substan- tially attenuated HFD-induced systemic effects, including weight gain, reduced energy expenditure, insulin resistance, glucose dysregulation, and hepatic steatosis. Mechanistically, KYNA accumulation promoted MFN1-dependent mitochondrial fusion, thereby enhancing hepatocyte mitochondrial function and counteracting HFD-induced metabolic dys- function. Conversely, liver-specific KAT1 knockout mice exhibited pro- gressive weight gain, glucose intolerance, and increased mitochondrial fragmentation.

**Conclusion:**
Collectively, our findings demonstrate that exercise shifts the tryptophan metabolic route from 3-HAA and AA to KYNA syn- thesis. These results provide proof of concept that targeting hepatic de novo KYNA synthesis is a promising therapeutic measure to control energy homeostasis.

**Diet induced obesity and insulin resistance is due to PTEN increase and is reversed by inhibiting PTEN**

**Background and aims:**
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a key regulator of insulin and glucose homeostasis. Recently our work led to the discovery that the negative regulator PTEN lipid phosphatase, is controlled by PI3K-mTOR mediated cap dependent translation, consti- tuting a feedback loop. Inhibiting PI3K with inhibitors reduces PTEN protein leading to a rebound in PI3K signaling. Physiological stimula- tion with ligands increases PTEN levels over time restoring pathway homeostasis. Insulin resistance is defined by reduced sensitivity of the PI3K/AKT network to insulin and is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes(T2D), hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia. Molecular causes and early signaling events underlying insulin resistance are still not well understood. We hypothesized that in DIO models, insulin resist- ance is due to hyperinsulinemia dependent induction of PTEN protein that prevent further increases in PI3K signaling.

**Materials and methods:**
3T3L1, C2C12 and HEPG2 were stimulated with insulin for 7 days and probed for PTEN, PI3K pathway activity, insulin response and glucose uptake. C57B6/J mice were fed with con- trol or western diet (high carb/high fat) for 12 weeks. Weight, insulin, glucose, glucose tolerance was measured and eWAT, liver, muscles collected every week to probe for PTEN and PI3K pathway activity. Liver and eWAT, were stained with H&E and OilRedO for analyzing MASH and hypertrophy. Treatment with VO-Ohpic (PTEN inhibitor) or RMC-5552 (mTORC1 inhibitor) was done either at the beginning of the diet or 2 weeks after the diet was given. Weight, insulin and glu- cose was measured and PTEN expression and PI3K activity analyzed.

**Results:**
Here we show that insulin activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in insulin target tissues, causes induction of PTEN transla- tion, a negative regulator of PI3K signaling. Adipose, muscle and liver cells stimulated with insulin for 7 days had increased PTEN protein by 3.5, 3.7 and 2 fold respectively. Insulin response (pAKT) and glu- cose uptake of the 7-day insulin treated cells was lower than treat- ment naïve cells. In a diet induced animal model of obesity and insulin resistance, we show that hyperinsulinemia starts within a week and PTEN levels are increased in fat, muscle, and liver (18-, 2.7-, 1.5-fold respectively) by then. Hyperinsulinemia and PTEN induction are fol- lowed by hyperglycemia by the second week along with severe glucose intolerance, weight gain and hepatic steatosis. In response to chronic hyperinsulinemia over 12 weeks, PTEN remains increased by 3 fold, while AKT activity is induced transiently before settling down to basal levels; PTEN-high and AKT-low state in tissues. The mechanism of insulin mediated PTEN increase is via mTORC1 dependent transla- tion. Inhibiting PTEN activity with a PTEN inhibitor VO-OHpic or its protein translation with a mTORC1 inhibitor RMC-5552, both prevent and reverse the effect of PTEN induction, rescue insulin resistance, obesity, and increase PI3K/AKT signaling.

**Conclusion:**
This suggests that induction of PTEN is necessary for the development of the metabolic deregulations and sufficient for their maintenance. Increase of PTEN by increasing levels of insulin, feedback inhibits the pathway to a point where downstream PI3K signaling is reduced and hyperglycemia ensues. PTEN induction is thus necessary for insulin resistance phenotypes and is a potential therapeutic target.

**CDK4/6 inhibition promotes Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) thermo- genesis via mitochondrial metabolic remodelling**

J. Qiao

**Background and aims:**
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a crucial role in thermoregulation and energy metabolism due to its powerful thermogenic function. The distinctive ability of BAT to oxidize lipids and generate heat has drawn considerable attention, particularly in the context of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance. Cell cycle regulators cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) have been shown to promote adipogenesis in WAT and influence beige adipocyte forma- tion. Given that CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as Palbociclib used in breast cancer treatment, are widely employed in oncology, the metabolic con- sequences resulting from cell cycle arrest induced by these inhibitors remain largely unexplored. Herein, we aim to investigate their roles in brown fat thermogenesis and their effects on insulin sensitivity.

**Materials and methods:**
The brown fat cells, derived from C3H10T1/2 cells and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells, were treated with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. RNA-seq analysis was conducted on pal- bociclib-treated mature adipocytes. QPCR and Western blot analyses were employed to validate the expression levels of Ucp-1, Pgc-1α, and genes associated with the mitochondrial thermogenesis pathway. Mitochondrial function was assessed using the Seahorse XF Analyzer. Additionally, the expression of thermogenesis-related genes was examined under the overexpression of the N-terminal, C-terminal, and full-length Rb protein. Finally, local injection of palbociclib into the BAT of high-fat-diet-fed mice was performed to investigate whether targeting the cell cycle in BAT represents an effective strategy for reversing insulin resistance.

**Results:**
CDK4/6 inhibition upregulates the pathways of oxi- dative phosphorylation and thermogenesis. The expression of Ucp-1, Pgc-1α, and mitochondrial genes (Cox7b, Cox8a, Cytob, and Sdhb) in brown adipocytes was verified, with elevated oxygen consumption rate (OCR) confirmed by mitochondrial function assays. Changes in the expression levels of Rb and mTOR were observed. Overexpres- sion of full-length Rb or the N-terminal fraction of Rb upregulated Ucp-1, Pgc-1α, and mitochondrial genes (Cox7b, Cox8a, and Sdhb), which could be attenuated by the mTOR inhibitor AZD8055. studies revealed that locally injected palbociclib alleviated glu- cose levels in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse models.

**Conclusion:**
Cdk4/6 modulate Ucp1-mediated mitochondrial ther- mogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) cells. The mitochondrial metabolic remodeling regulated by the Rb-mTOR1-PGC-1α axis was found to be activated in BAT cells treated with the CDK4/6 inhibi- tor palbociclib. These findings highlight the critical role of CDK4/6 in thermogenesis, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for combating conditions such as obesity and insulin resistance.

**Sox4 drives a cancer associated fibriblast-like transition in adi- pose stromal cells to promote metabolic disease**

K. Drareni, D.M. Merrick, P. Seale

**Background and aims:**
Adipose tissue (AT) plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis and regulating systemic metabolism. During obesity, maladaptive AT expansion drives metabolic disor- ders, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D). Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a heterogeneous cell population that contributes to AT remodeling, but their roles in obesity-induced dysfunction and the development of T2D remains unclear. Here, we characterize obesity-associated MPC subsets in AT and identify molecular drivers of metabolic pathology.

**Conclusion:**
Sox4 drives the development of a CAF-like MPC subset that drives AT fibrosis, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction in obesity, ultimately contributing to T2D. Midkine secretion by these cells mediates downstream inflammatory effects, and targeting Sox4 or Midkine signaling in MPCs offers a novel strategy to restore healthy AT remodeling and prevent obesity-related metabolic disease.

**Post-weaning protein restriction impairs glucagon-like peptide 1 action and leads to pancreatic islet atrophy in mice**

K.M. Oliveira, Carneiro

**Background and aims:**
Nutrient imbalances can affect intestinal func- tion, altering the production of gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). This, in turn, can influence glycemic homeostasis which is concerning given that undernutrition remains a prevalent issue. There- fore, our aim was to evaluate intestinal and pancreatic GLP-1 produc- tion and its action on insulin secretion.

**Materials and methods:**
Four-week-old C57Bl/6 male mice were divided into control (C) fed a 14% protein diet and protein-restricted (R) fed a 6% protein diet for three months. Data were analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test followed by parametric (Student t-test) or non- parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test), P<0.05.

**Results:**
As expected, protein undernutrition reduced serum albumin, total protein levels, and body weight gain in the R group (1.9 ± 0.1, 4.9 ± 0.2 mg/mL, and 6.2 ± 0.5 g, respectively) compared to the C group (2.2 ± 0.1, 5.5 ± 0.2 mg/mL and 8.7 ± 0.7 g, respectively). Protein dep- rivation induced higher oral glucose tolerance during both glucose and mixed meal tolerance tests and augmented insulin sensitivity during insulin tolerance test in R mice (12175 ± 536.7 and 1924 ± 149.2mg/ dL.min-1 and 2.8 ± 0.1%min, respectively) compared to C mice (14291 ± 698.0 and 2970 ± 350.6mg/dL.min-1 and 2.1 ± 0.2%min). Dur- ing the mixed meal tolerance test, R mice had increased total GLP-1 plasma concentration at 10 min (28.0 ± 0.7 pM) compared to the C group (25.5 ± 0.7 pM). However, despite that increase, R mice did not respond with augmented insulin secretion presenting lower insulinemia at both basal (0.32 ±. 0.2 mg/mL) and 10 min (0.65 ± 0.1 mg/mL) than C mice (0.5 ± 0.05 and 1.3 ± 0.1 mg/mL, respectively). Isolated islets from the R group hyposecreted insulin at 11.1 mM glucose (0.45 ± 0.06 ng/islet.h) and when associated with a GLP-1R agonist, exendin 4 (0.7 ± 0.1 ng/islet.h) compared to C (0.65 ± 0.06 and 1.1 ± 0.2 ng/ islet.h ng/islet.h). Additionally, isolated pancreatic islets from R mice presented a 30% decreased gene expression compared to isolated pancreatic islets from C mice. Considering GLP-1 pancreatic islet pro- duction, we analyzed intra-islet GLP-1 expression and observed that R mice presented augmented GLP-1 positive area per pancreatic islet area ratio (0.11 ± 0.06) compared to C mice (0.06 ± 0.004). Also, this was confirmed since isolated pancreatic islets from R mice displayed a 45% increase in GLP-1 total content (382.0 ± 20.9 pM) compared to isolated pancreatic islets from C mice (262.6 ± 18.2 pM). Furthermore, protein deprivation decreased pancreas weight, number, and area of pancreatic islets in the R group (8.0 ± 0.3mg/g BW, 17.0 ± 2.0, and 8130 ± 502.8) compared to the C group (10.4 ± 0.7 mg/g BW, 28.9 ± 4.2 and 9937 ± 614.8).

**Conclusion:**
Protein undernutrition augmented glucose tolerance, possibly due to increased insulin sensitivity, despite pancreatic islet hypotrophy and diminished insulin secretion from isolated islets. Furthermore, pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion in R mice was impaired in response to incretin stimulation, probably caused by diminished GLP-1 receptor gene expression in pancreatic islets.

**Novel MIDY-mouse models show no decrease in beta cell mass despite overt diabetes from a young age**

1. Helmholtz Zentrum München Deutsches Forschungszentrum für
2. Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany, Institute

**Background and aims:**
Mutant INS-gene-induced diabetes of youth is a severe monogenic form of diabetes characterized by increased endoplasmic reticulum stress due to misfolding mutant proinsulin. This results in diminished insulin availability and early-onset diabe- tes. Conventionally, it is assumed that reduced plasma insulin and thus increasing blood glucose levels coincide with a loss of beta cell mass. Understanding the pathomechanism behind MIDY, particu- larly how distinct mutations affect proinsulin folding, is crucial for advancing treatment options. This study aimed to comprehensively phenotype a new mouse line, , which harbors a mutation common in human MIDY patients, affecting the favored initial cysteine bridge to form.

**Materials and methods:**
The mouse line was generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutagenesis on a C3HeB/FeJ back- ground. The diabetic phenotype was examined in an 18-week pheno- typing study, starting at 4 weeks of age. This included biweekly body weight and blood glucose measurements. Additionally, alpha, beta and delta cell mass were determined using formalin-fixed pancreatic tissue embedded in paraffin. All islets present in two sections 150 μm apart were analyzed. Further, glucose stimulated insulin secretion was examined in isolated islets. Heterozygous mutant mice of both genders were compared with wild-type littermates.

**Results:**
Male mutants showed a pronounced and progressive dia- betic phenotype from week 5 (p=<0.0001). Female mutants rapidly developed diabetes but did not progress to blood glucose levels above 220 mg/dl (p=<0.0001). GSIS data confirmed these observations. Mutant male islets were still responsive to glucose at 4 weeks of age (n=12, p=0.3672), but showed a significant decrease in their respon- siveness at 12 weeks of age (n=11-12, p=<0.0001). In contrast, islets from female mutants were still responsive to glucose at 12 weeks of age (n=10-12, p=0.5221). Despite longstanding severe diabetes at 22 weeks of age, there was no decline in beta cell mass in either gender (n=6, p(Males)=0.1158, p(Females)=0.2549.) Accompanying alpha and delta cell mass also saw no changes (n=6, p=0.1952-0.8694).

**Conclusion:**
We identified the mutant as a reliable model for MIDY and demonstrated a robust diabetic phenotype. This unique mutation affects the last remaining cysteine bridge, for which no model has been established. However, the most interesting finding of this study is the absence of beta cell mass decline at 22 weeks of age. This is in stark contrast to the literature, as all models established to date have shown a strong decline in older animals. Compara- tive analyzes with existing models could elucidate mechanisms that maintain beta-cell mass despite the enormous degree of ER stress and glucotoxicity. This can potentially inform therapeutic strategies for diseases such as type 2 diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Early clinical trials suggest the promise of stem-cell-derived treatments, but little is known about how adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) perceive these potential future treatments. We explored these perceptions among adults using or offered advanced hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems; the current highest standard of care for T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
A phenomenological qualitative study with adults with T1D purposively sampled to include half expressing inter- est in stem-cell trials (recruited via CellT1D registry) and half previ- ously unaware (recruited via hospital T1D clinics). Participants were recruited if they were using (14/15, 93%) or were offered HCL systems. All received a brief, co-designed leaflet about stem-cell treatments. Semi-structured interviews explored perceptions of stem-cell treat- ments, current T1D management, information needs and reasons for expressing interest, or not. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify salient themes.

**Results:**
Of the 15 current participants (5 proactively interested; 10 no prior expression of interest; target n=20, more to follow), 40% were female; age range 25-68 years; mean ± SD age at diagnosis was 21 ± 17 years; and mean ± SD HbA1c 53.6 ± 9 mmol/L. Preliminary analyses suggest individuals’ motivations towards stem-cell treatments are influenced by their satisfaction with their current glycaemic levels, perceived limitations of their current treatments/technologies and their emotional relationship with their T1D. Those considering stem-cell treatment as a viable future option expressed a strong desire for per- fect glycaemia, alongside fear of developing complications and marked psychological aversion to hyperglycaemia. The everyday burdens associated with HCL included alert fatigue, device dependency, and manual data input/interpretation. For those diagnosed as adults, interest in stem-cell treatments was motivated by the disruptive impact T1D had on their lives. The language used to describe stem-cell treatments shaped perceptions; “transplant" was readily understood, but carried negative connotations, e.g. surgery, invasiveness, rejection risk, and uncertainty. In contrast, "therapy" evoked positivity, warmth, and continuity of care, but introduced ambiguity about the nature of the procedure. Though terminology shaped perceptions, it did not appear to affect motivations.

**Conclusion:**
Our findings highlight links between personal satisfaction with current T1D management and the appeal of investigational stem- cell treatments. Perceptions appeared to be influenced by the emotional burden of diabetes, especially amongst those diagnosed later in life, reflecting persistent unmet needs despite use of advanced technologies. Findings also show that terminology strongly influences immediate per- ceptions and emotional responses to stem-cell treatments, underscoring the importance of language use in clinical and public communications. While core motivations remained unchanged, further analysis will explore how terminology may influence participation rates and highlight optimal communication strategies as stem-cell trials progress.

**Rapid entry of newly synthesized insulin and C-peptide in plasma reveals beta cell insulin reserve relative to secretory demand, pre- cedes diet-induced hyperglycemia in ZDF rats and differs by strain**

**Background and aims:**
T2D evolves through progressive loss of insulin (Ins) reserve and secretory capacity in β-cells. Non-invasive detection of Ins depletion in β-cells has not been possible. We tested a flux-based, non-invasive method for identifying reduced β-cell Ins stores relative to secretory demand. The time for newly synthesized Ins and C-peptide (C-P) to appear and become fully labeled in plasma reveals their residence time (RT) in β-cells prior to release. We asked whether: i) depleted Ins reserves in a T2D rat model result in newly synthesized Ins and C-P pass- ing through β-cells more rapidly (shorter RT); ii. Ins and C-P kinetics in plasma accurately reflect turnover in islets; iii) shorter RT develops before hyperglycemia during development of T2D by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in female ZDF (fZDF) rats; and iv) RT differs in rat strains with different risk for T2D.

**Materials and methods:**
H O was given for 1 - 18 hr to 32 fZDF rats fed chow or HFD. The latter induces T2D. H-labeling pattern in intact Ins and C-P was measured by high-resolution mass spectrometry after antibody pulldown from plasma or islets. Fractional synthesis rate (FSR) was calculated; RT= 1/FSR. Time-course of RT and hyperglycemia were also measured serially during the first 10d of HFD in fZDF. In addition, RT in rat strains with differing risk of T2D were compared (Sprague- Dawley [SD], lean Zucker and Zucker Fatty [ZF]).

**Results:**
RT of plasma Ins (Ins-1 and Ins-2) were shorter in T2D vs non- diabetic fZDF (2.3 vs. 5.4 hr, p < 0.0001, Fig 1A) as was RT of islet Ins (3.4 hr vs. 8.6 hr, p <0.0001). Ins labeling in islets vs plasma correlated closely ­(r 0.91 - 0.96, p<0.0001), although new Ins was 10-15% higher in plasma than islets. C-P kinetics correlated closely with Ins kinetics and gave similar results. Ins or C-P RT measured at 3 hr of H O labeling differentiated T2D from non-T2D rats (p<0.001). RT was significantly reduced to ~ 2 hr during the first 3 - 10 days of HFD (Fig. 1B), before onset of hyperglycemia after day 10. Ins and C-P RT were shorter on chow diet in ZF than in SD or lean Zucker strains. In summary rapid appearance of newly synthesized Ins or C-P in plasma (reduced RT in β-cells) is a non-invasive measure of loss of Ins reserve relative to secre- tory demand in ZDF rats. Ins and C-P kinetics in plasma accurately reflect turnover in islets. 10 - 15% higher fraction new Ins in plasma than islets indicates some direct secretion without mixing into islet storage pools.

**Conclusion:**
Reduced RT precedes hyperglycemia and differs among strains, suggesting predictive value as a biomarker of risk for secretory failure. This non-invasive assay of β-cell loss of secretory reserve is trans- latable into humans.

**Background and aims:**
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) involves progres- sive β-cell insulin (Ins) secretory reserve depletion, yet no method exists to assess secretory reserve (defined as Ins pool size relative to secretory demand), predict incipient β-cell failure, or monitor β-cell plasticity in humans. We present a minimally invasive flux-based stable isotope labeling method for identifying β-cell Ins reserve. The basic concept is that secretory demand reduces Ins stores, shortening intracellular Ins and C-peptide (C-P) residence time (RT) prior to secretion. We quantify mass isotopomer enrichments in plasma Ins and C-P (which derive exclusively from β-cells) during oral ²H O- labelling. Newly synthesized are differentiated from pre-existing molecules based on H-enrichment. In female ZDF rats, we have shown that RT is markedly shorter in T2D vs non-T2D and precedes hyperglycemia during T2D progression. Here, we measure for the first time β-cell Ins and C-P RT in humans.

**Materials and methods:**
Four healthy volunteers (HV) received 42 ml of H O three times a day for 6 days, with fasting blood draws on days 2, 4, and 6. H O plasma enrichment ­(E which deter- mines H-enrichments in free amino acids) was quantified by IRMS. Ins and C-P were immunoprecipitated from 500 μl plasma. Intact Ins and C-P were analyzed by QE LC-MS for mass isotopomer enrich- ments ­(M ). A precursor H-enrichment curve p(t) was generated from ­E and a single-pool kinetic model was fitted on ­M data, using p(t) as an input to estimate fraction synthesis rate (k), where RT = 1/k. Two independent laboratories replicated the full analyti- cal workflow.

**Results:**
In four HV (mean±SD age 48±14 years, BMI 25±4 kg/m , HbA1c 5.3±0.2 %), we estimated RT for Ins ­(RT ) = 2.4±0.6 days and RT for C-P (RTc) = 1.3±0.3 days. ­RT and ­RT were tightly correlated (r=0.99, p = 0.008) but RTc was 47% shorter than ­RT (p=0.006), see Figure 1. This finding suggests that C-P either degrades more rapidly than Ins in β-cells or is preferentially released into circulation.

**Conclusion:**
We report the first human application of a minimally inva- sive β-cell secretory reserve quantification method using RT of Ins and C-P measured in plasma. ­RT of 2.6 days is faster than generally thought and the shorter RT of C-P compared to Ins suggests differential intracellular processing. Though consistent with findings, this finding challenges the assumption of equimolar Ins and C-P storage and secretion. These results provide new understanding of β-cell physiology. Importantly, this method uniquely captures β-cell storage pool dynamics and potential loss of secretory reserve, offering a novel tool to monitor disease progression and therapy effects.

**Interplay between cGMP and cAMP signalling in the primary cilium of islet cells**

C. Incedal Nilsson

**Background and aims:**
Primary cilia, although continuous with the plasma membrane and cytosol, act as specialized signaling hubs for integrating external cues. Cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, shape the ciliary signaling landscape and influence pathways such as Hedge- hog. Although cilia contain both cGMP-sensitive phosphodiesterase and effector proteins (e.g. CNG channels), it is unclear how cGMP signals are shaped and to what extent they crosstalk with cAMP and Ca² . This study aimed to elucidate the dynamics of cyclic nucleotide signaling in the primary cilia of pancreatic islet β-cells.

**Materials and methods:**
TIRF microscopy of intact mouse, human and MIN6 pseudo-islets expressing cilia-targeted sensors for cGMP, cAMP and ­Ca were used to record ciliary dynamics. Transcription factor dynamics were assessed by overexpressing Halo-Gli2 constructs in mouse and human islets, with images acquired using spinning disk and laser scanning confocal microscopy.

**Results:**
In human islets, both atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and GLP-1 stimulated cytosolic cGMP production in a glucose and Ca² - dependent manner (ANP effect; n=169 cells from 5 different donors. ****P<0.0001; and GLP-1 effect; n=131 cells from 5 different donors. ****P<0.0001; 2-way ANOVA, Tukey´s multiple comparison test). Similar to cAMP, cGMP entered the cilium via diffusion. However, unlike cAMP elevations, increased cGMP triggered localized ciliary Ca² influx through activation of the CNGA3 channel. Upon ANP stimulation, cGMP levels significantly increased within the cilium (n=22 cilia, Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank test, p<0.0001), leading to ciliary ­Ca transients (n=45 cilia from 4 islets, P=0.0325; Wil- coxon matched-pairs rank test). This effect was abolished by an ANP receptor antagonist, as no difference was observed between basal and ANP-treated conditions (n=45 cilia from 4 islets, Wilcoxon matched- pairs rank test). Intriguingly, somatostatin-induced reductions in ciliary cAMP also triggered ciliary ­Ca signaling, indicating opposing but converging effects of the two cyclic nucleotides. Supporting this, eleva- tion of cGMP levels via inhibition of cGMP-dependent phosphodies- terase 9 led to a decrease in ciliary cAMP levels without affecting cyto- solic cAMP levels ­(n =22, ­n =30, Mann-Whitney, p<0.0001). Consistent with such opposing roles, both cAMP reduction and cGMP elevation induced nuclear translocation of the cilia-dependent transcrip- tion factor GLI2 through a ­Ca -dependent mechanism (ANP effect on Gli2 nuclear entry ­n =3562 cells from 23 islets, ­n =2699 from 14 islets, ­n =3261 cells from 20 islets from 2 donor).

**Conclusion:**
We describe a novel cGMP-mediated signaling mecha- nism in islet β-cells that involve localized Ca² influx and GLI2 activa- tion, indicating that primary cilia are major target of cGMP action.

**Background and aims:**
In the early stages of diabetic kidney dis- ease (DKD), podocyte loss is a critical event that contributes to the development of albuminuria. Although sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated renoprotective effects in patients with DKD, their efficacy in the early phases of the disease remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the effects of dapagliflozin on renal ultrastructural changes in early DKD using a streptozotocin (STZ) and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model.

**Materials and methods:**
Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were administered streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day for five consecutive days and concurrently fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% fat, 20% protein, 20% carbohydrates) for 30 weeks to induce early dia- betic kidney disease (DKD). Dapagliflozin was administered orally via gavage for 24 weeks, beginning after 6 weeks of HFD feeding. Insulin tolerance tests were conducted at week 28, and renal assess- ments—including 24-hour urinary albumin abd protein-to-creatinine ratio, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and renal cortical tissue analysis—were performed after 24 weeks of dapa- gliflozin treatment.

**Results:**
Random and fasting blood glucose levels, as well as insulin tolerance, were significantly improved in the dapagliflozin-treated group compared to the STZ-HFD group. Although urinary NGAL levels and albuminuria at 30 weeks were not significantly differ- ent between the two groups (p = 0.49 and p = 0.72, respectively), proteinuria was significantly reduced in the dapagliflozin group (p = 0.0007). Expression of megalin, a tubular protein responsible for albumin reabsorption, remained preserved across all groups. Immu- nohistochemical analysis revealed that glomerular volume and mesangial expansion were reduced by 25.02% and 30.13%, respec- tively, in the dapagliflozin group compared to the STZ-HFD group (p = 0.043 and p = 0.0007). Furthermore, glomerular basement mem- brane thickness was decreased by 17.59% in the dapagliflozin-treated mice (p = 0.0007).

**Conclusion:**
Dapagliflozin attenuated diabetic kidney disease in the STZ-HFD mouse model by preserving glomerular structural integrity and maintaining podocyte morphology. Notably, this study demon- strates that dapagliflozin confers renoprotective effects prior to the onset of marked albuminuria or overt tubular injury. In addition to its glycemic benefits, dapagliflozin provided clear ultrastructural evi- dence of protection against podocytopathy, underscoring its thera- peutic potential in the early stages of DKD.

**Background and aims:**
Treatment benefits of simultaneous initia- tion and combination therapy with the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone and a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) in reducing urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) have been reported in the CONFIDENCE trial. We evalu- ated the benefits and safety profile of combination therapy with finer- enone and an SGLT2i in participants enrolled in Asia.

**Materials and methods:**
The CONFIDENCE trial enrolled adults with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes with a UACR of ≥100 to <5000 mg/g and on a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily finerenone (10 or 20 mg) plus empagliflozin (10 mg), finerenone (10 or 20 mg) plus placebo, or empagliflozin (10 mg) plus placebo. In a subgroup analysis, treatment effects on the primary endpoint of relative change in UACR from baseline at day 180 were assessed for Asian participants.

**Results:**
In CONFIDENCE, among 360 participants (45%) enrolled from Asia, change in UACR from baseline (95% CI) at day 180 with combination therapy was −30% (−44%, −11%) vs finerenone alone and −34% (−47%, −16%) vs empagliflozin alone; Table). The propor- tion of Asian participants with any treatment-emergent hyperkalae- mia adverse events (AEs) was 10.7% for those receiving combination therapy, 13.8% for finerenone alone, and 4.8% for empagliflozin alone. No treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia AEs led to hospitalization, per- manent discontinuation of study drug, or death. These findings are consistent with those for the overall study population.

**Conclusion:**
Simultaneous initiation of finerenone and an SGLT2i was effective and well-tolerated among the nearly half of participants in CONFIDENCE who were enrolled from Asia.

**Background and aims:**
Higher BMI is paradoxically linked to improved outcomes in hemodialysis (HD) patients, known as the "obe- sity paradox". Whether this paradox extends to other anthropometric indices remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of both conventional and less frequently used anthro- pometric indices in predicting mortality, 3-point major adverse cardio- vascular events (3P-MACE), and 4-point major adverse renal events (4P-MARE) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

**Materials and methods:**
We prospectively analyzed a cohort across all CKD stages G1-G5 (n=581). Outcomes included all-cause mortal- ity, 3P-MACE (cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myo- cardial infarction), and 4P-MARE (incident CKD, worsening kidney disease, new kidney replacement therapy, renal death). Assessed indices for these outcomes were BMI, hip and waist circumference, waist-to-height-ratio, waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR), Hip Index, Abdominal Volume Index, Body Roundness Index, Relative Fat mass (RFM), A Body Shape Index (ABSI), Conicity Index, estimated total body fat (eTBF), and weight adjusted waist index (WWI). Analysis was done using Cox regression, adjusted for sex, age, systolic blood pressure, atherosclerotic disease, smoking status, LDL cholesterol, eGFR, CRP, and diabetes status.

**Results:**
About 507 (87.3%) individuals with available follow-up (FU) data were analyzed (median FU time: 7.4 years). Of these, 86.0% had CKD, with 41.2% receiving HD therapy. While BMI showed a numeri- cally inverse association with mortality (adjusted Hazard Ratio: 0.88 [95% Confidence Interval: 0.71 - 1.08]), several non-traditional indi- ces were significantly positively associated with increased mortality: WHR (1.44 [1.14-1.82]), ABSI (1.37 [1.16-1.63]), Conicity Index (1.41 [1.13-1.75]), eTBF (1.42 [1.14-1.77]), and WWI (1.45 [1.18- 1.78]) (Figure 1). Similar associations were observed for 3P-MACE (Figure 1). For 4P-MARE, only WWI remained a significant predictor (1.35 [1.01-1.84]) (Figure 1). In subgroup analyses stratified by HD status, WHR, ABSI, Conicity Index, eTBF, and WWI demonstrated particularly strong associations with mortality among patients undergo- ing HD (data not shown).

**Conclusion:**
Consistent with prior literature, BMI showed a non-sig- nificant inverse association with mortality. However, less frequently used anthropometric indices like ABSI, Conicity Index, eTBF, and WWI were significantly associated with mortality in a CKD cohort, even in patients undergoing HD. These findings highlight the poten- tial of alternative anthropometric markers to better capture risk in this high-risk population.

**Diagnostic glycaemic thresholds for diabetes based on biopsy‑con- firmed diabetic kidney disease: comparative analysis with retinop- athy‑derived criteria**

J.-K. Yang

**Background and aims:**
Current diagnostic criteria for diabetes rely predominantly on glycemic thresholds derived from the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR), potentially underestimating the burden of diabetic kidney disease (DKD)—a diabetes-specific complication that often portends greater morbidity.

**Materials and methods:**
We retrospectively analyzed 5,400 indi- viduals who underwent renal biopsy to redefine diagnostic glyce- mic cutoffs based on biopsy‑proven DKD prevalence. Participants were stratified into deciles for fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2‑hour postprandial glucose (2hPG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). For each marker, we identified the decile at which DKD prevalence rose sharply, calculated optimal thresholds, and assessed diagnos- tic performance via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We then externally validated these thresholds in 71 patients with non‑diabetic kidney disease (NDKD) and 72 patients with DKD (including those with concurrent NDKD), and compared their per- formance against World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.

**Results:**
Of the participants, 562 (10.4%) were diagnosed with DKD either alone or coexisting with other renal diseases. Fig.1 shows the prevalence of DKD and DR by deciles of the distribution of FPG, 2hPG, and HbA1c levels in the study population. DKD prev- alence increased markedly beginning at the ninth decile for FPG (≥5.7 mmol/L), the eighth decile for 2hPG (≥7.5 mmol/L), and the eighth decile for HbA1c (≥6.0%). In contrast, DR prevalence rose notably at FPG ≥6.4 mmol/L, 2hPG ≥8.0 mmol/L, and HbA1c ≥6.2%. All three glycemic measures demonstrated strong ROC‑based discrimination for DKD. In external validation, DKD‑based thresh- olds performed comparably or slightly better than WHO‑recom- mended cutoffs.DKD prevalence increased markedly beginning at the ninth decile for FPG (≥5.7 mmol/L), the eighth decile for 2hPG (≥7.5 mmol/L), and the eighth decile for HbA1c (≥6.0%). In contrast, DR prevalence rose notably at FPG ≥6.4 mmol/L, 2hPG ≥8.0 mmol/L, and HbA1c ≥6.2%. All three glycemic measures dem- onstrated strong ROC‑based discrimination for DKD. The HbA1c cutoff of 6.0% showed comparable AUC (0.78 vs. 0.76) and higher sensitivity (86.1% vs. 61.1%) compared to the WHO threshold of 6.5%, albeit with a slightly lower specificity (69.4% vs. 90.3%). The F1 score was also marginally higher (0.70 vs. 0.68), indicating slightly better overall diagnostic performance. In external validation, DKD‑based thresholds performed comparably or slightly better than WHO‑recommended cutoffs.

**Conclusion:**
Glycemic thresholds optimized for DKD are lower than those for DR, indicating that kidney‑specific complications may arise at modestly elevated glucose levels. These findings support revis- ing diabetes diagnostic criteria to incorporate DKD risk, potentially enabling earlier intervention to prevent renal injury.

**Background and aims:**
Type-2 diabetes(T2D) predisposes people to chronic kidney disease(CKD) and both conditions associate with sys- temic inflammation/higher mortality rate. High sensitivity C-reactive protein(hsCRP) is a marker of systemic inflammation and is itself an independent risk factor for mortality.

**Materials and methods:**
In a prospective study of 718 individuals with a diagnosis of T2D followed up for up to 24 years, we exam- ined how baseline hsCRP related to development of the two main components of CKD, urine albumin/creatinine ratio (uACR)≥3mmol and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<60ml/min/1.73m2 and also to mortality. Individuals with complete baseline data were stratified into three clinical groups: Group 1(no CKD), Group 2(CKD with preserved eGFR but elevated uACR), and Group 3(CKD with reduced eGFR and elevated uACR). The primary analyses utilized multivariate Cox proportional hazards models for mortality and multivariate linear regression models for longitudinal renal function decline. Data were analysed from recruitment to the last follow-up. Models were adjusted for key confounders including age/sex/base- line eGFR/baseline uACR. hsCRP quartiles Q1-Q4 corresponded to increasing hsCRP.

**Results:**
The study had a mean follow-up period of 14.9 years(sd 5.5). At baseline, 255(61.4%) patients were male and mean age 63.5 ± 10.7 years. At the end of follow up 293(70.6%) had died. A trend was observed where patients in the Group 3 at baseline were more likely to have hsCRP levels above the 50th percentile(63.3%) compared to the other groups(47.5% in Group 1 and 46.8% in Group 2). Cox regression for all-cause mortality accounting for ordinal scale of hsCRP and CKD groups, showed baseline hsCRP levels as not a significant predictor of mortality. In contrast, the baseline CKD group was a strong and inde- pendent predictor of mortality(overall p=0.009), with patients in Group 1 having a significantly lower risk of death compared to those in the highest-risk Group 3(Hazard Ratio ≈ 0.60). No significant bidirectional relationship was found between hsCRP and glycaemic control (HbA1c) at baseline. Longitudinal renal function analysis showed numerical trends towards greater mean eGFR decline (-20.6 ml/min in Q1 vs -26.4 ml/min in Q4) and greater fold increase in ACR(1.93 in Q1 vs. 2.91 in Q4) in higher hsCRP quartiles. In multivariate linear regression analyses, baseline hsCRP was not an independent predictor of either eGFR decline(p=0.267) / change in uACR(p=0.884).

**Conclusion:**
In this long-term prospective cohort of individuals with T2D, baseline hsCRP was associated with future progression of CKD markers but the association did not hold with adjustment for age, sex, baseline eGFR and ACR. Nevertheless, hsCRP may act as a single surrogate quantifiable analyte encompassing multiple risk factors denoting individuals with greater risk of rapid progression of diabetic nephropathy.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most prevalent comorbidities of type 2 diabetes (T2D), affecting around 50% of patients with T2D. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which have been previously described as key players in T2D, are markers of systemic metabolic stress. However, it is unknown if the metabolism-related transcriptomic profile of PBMCs is altered in T2D and DKD. The objective was to study differences in the transcriptomic profile of PBMCs from patients with T2D with and without DKD, compared to control subjects.

**Materials and methods:**
PBMCs were obtained from 12 control sub- jects, 12 subjects with T2D and 12 subjects with T2D and DKD. RNA was extracted and analyzed with the nCounter® Metabolic Pathways Panel (NanoString). Pathway analysis was conducted using nSolver and R. Individual pathway scores were calculated to study correlations with biochemical and clinical parameters.

**Results:**
The metabolic gene expression signature of T2D and DKD groups showed a clear and significant difference from the control group. Commonly downregulated genes in both T2D and DKD include SLC7A11 and ARID2 (p<0.05). However, several genes were specifi- cally downregulated in T2D vs controls (ASH1L, PTPRC and TET2, p<0.05), while the DKD group showed overexpression of CPT1A and GBA and downregulation of SMAD3, PI3CA, IFR4, ICOS and IDO1 vs the control group (p<0.05). When looking at GO pathway enrich- ment, immune system-related pathways were upregulated and prolif- eration, migration and cellular dynamics were downregulated in both T2D and DKD compared to the control group (p<0.05). Regarding the metabolism-related pathways, “fatty acid beta-oxidation” was upregu- lated in DKD vs control, while “fructose 6-phoshate metabolic pro- cess” was upregulated in DKD vs T2D (p<0.05). The antigen presen- tation pathway, which was overrepresented in DKD vs T2D (p<0.01), positively correlated with microalbuminuria (r=0.39, p<0.05), whereas the amino acid transporter pathway, underrepresented in DKD vs con- trols (p<0.05), negatively correlated with BMI (r=-0.37, p<0.05) and complement component 3 (r=-0.36, p<0.05). Lastly, antigen presen- tation and fatty acid oxidation- overrepresented in DKD vs control and T2D (p<0.05) - and phosphate pentose pathway - overrepresented in DKD vs T2D (p<0.05) correlated positively with markers of sys- temic inflammation including leukocyte and neutrophil counts (r=0.38, r=0.50 and r=0.38, respectively; r=0.61, r=0.60 and r=49; all p<0.05) and indexes derived from blood cell counts (MLR: r=0.64, r=0.69 and r=0.70; NLR: r=0.73, r=0.54 and r=0.51; SII: r=0.62, r=0.46 and r=0.46; all p<0.05).

**Conclusion:**
The transcriptomic profiles of PBMCs of T2D and DKD patients reveal differential expression and enrichment of metabolism- related genes and pathways, which are associated with clinical param- eters, especially with systemic inflammation and may inform novel key players and biomarkers of T2D and DKD.

**Empagliflozin, semaglutide and their combination reduce renal sinus fat in patients with type 2 diabetes**

L. Vernstrøm

**Background and aims:**
Growing evidence suggests that fat deposition in and around the kidneys contributes to renal dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. Specifically, increased renal sinus fat has been observed in patients with T2DM and chronic kidney disease, suggesting a mecha- nistic link between ectopic renal fat deposition and disease progres- sion. Empagliflozin and semaglutide have demonstrated renoprotective effects, yet their impact on renal fat, individually or in combination, remains unstudied. We have previously reported significant reductions in total kidney volume with these agents, but it is unknown whether these changes reflect alterations in renal fat content. This study is the first to evaluate MRI-derived changes in renal fat in response to treat- ment with empagliflozin, semaglutide and their combination, offering novel insights into renal-specific mechanisms of action.

**Materials and methods:**
This was a substudy of a 32-week rand- omized clinical trial on the effects of empagliflozin and semaglutide alone or in combination. Eighty patients with type 2 diabetes (age 68 ± 7 years; HbA1c 60 ± 10 mmol/mol; GFR 87 ± 22 mL/min/1.73 ­m ) and high risk of cardiovascular disease were randomised into four groups ( =20 in each) receiving either placebo, empagliflozin, sema- glutide or their combination for 32 weeks. We analysed the effects of treatment on changes in renal sinus fat percentage and intrarenal fat percentage (renal parenchyma, including both cortex and medulla) measured by MRI using a Dixon fat fraction sequence.

**Results:**
All active treatment groups had a statistically significant reduction in renal sinus fat compared to placebo (empagliflozin -2.6 % points (95%CI -4.1;-1.9), p=0.001, semaglutide -2.6 % points (95%CI -4.2;-0.9), p=0.002, combination -2.3 % points (95%CI -4.2;-0.5), p=0.02). This reduction remained significant in the empagliflozin group after adjustment for changes in BMI (p=0.01) but was attenu- ated in the semaglutide and combination group. We found no changes in the intrarenal fat percentage in any of the treatment groups com- pared to placebo. Changes in renal sinus fat and intrarenal fat were not associated with the reduction in total kidney volume (β=0.03, p=0.15, β=-0.002, p=0.52, respectively).

**Conclusion:**
This study demonstrates that empagliflozin, semaglutide and their combination reduce renal sinus fat in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. The reduction with empagliflozin treatment was independent of changes in BMI. In contrast, intrarenal fat remained unchanged across all treatment arms. These findings offer novel mechanistic insights into the renoprotective effects of empagli- flozin and semaglutide and underscore the potential of renal sinus fat as a modifiable contributor to diabetic kidney disease.

**The mechanism of MMP-7 mediating RAAS activation associated with diabetic kidney injury through syndecan-1 pathway**

L. Yang

**Background and aims:**
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play sig- nificant roles in renal interstitial fibrosis. However, the potential role of MMP-7 in this process remains incompletely understood. Syndecan-1 (SDC1), a substrate of MMP-7, regulates inflammatory responses and fibrotic processes. This study aims to elucidate the expression and functional role of MMP-7 in DKD and investigate its mechanism in SDC1-mediated RAAS activation-associated renal injury.

**Materials and methods:**
(1)Cross-sectional study investigating the correlation between serum MMP-7 levels and DKD, along with its diagnostic value. (2)Experimental studies exploring MMP-7 expression and function in DKD renal injury. (3)Mechanistic studies on SDC1, VEGF, and RAAS regulation in animal and cellular models.

**Results:**
(1) The DKD group exhibited elevated levels of MMP- 7. (2) ROC analysis demonstrated diagnostic potential: MMP-7 (AUC=0.851, 95% CI:0.778-0.924), eGFR (AUC=0.828, 95% CI:0.752-0.904), and UACR (AUC=0.885, 95% CI:0.824-0.946). Combined use of all three biomarkers achieved superior diagnostic performance (AUC=0.944, 95% CI:0.886-0.978) with 83.08% sensi- tivity and 94.23% specificity. (3) In DKD murine models, significant upregulation of MMP-7, KIM-1, NAGL, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-18, Col- lagen I, Vimentin, and α-SMA was observed compared to controls (P<0.05), which was attenuated by AAV-shMMP7 treatment. His- topathological evaluation revealed: HE staining: Tubular epithelial cell edema, vacuolization, and glomerular capsule expansion in DKD group, ameliorated by MMP-7 knockdown PAS staining: Increased PAS-positive areas and basement membrane thickening in DKD (P<0.05), reversed by AAV-shMMP7. Masson staining: Enhanced collagen deposition in DKD kidneys (P<0.05), reduced by MMP-7 suppression. (4) In HGPA-treated HK-2 cells, MMP-7 mRNA/protein expression and inflammatory markers (KIM-1, NAGL, IL-1β, TNF- α, IL-18) were significantly elevated vs. controls. MMP-7 silencing attenuated these HGPA-induced effects (P<0.05). (5)DKD models (in vivo and in vitro) demonstrated elevated SDC1, collagen subtypes (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL8A1), VEGFA, and RAAS components (renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone) compared to controls (P<0.05). MMP-7 suppression reversed these alterations. (6) Rescue experiments demonstrated: MMP-7 inhibition attenuated downstream pathway activation and renal fibrosis; SDC1 recombinant protein restored VEGF expression and fibrotic/inflammatory mark- ers; Co-administration of finerenone (aldosterone receptor antagonist) counteracted SDC1-mediated fibroinflammatory effects.

**Conclusion:**
(1) Serum MMP-7 elevation in DKD patients correlates positively with renal dysfunction markers (creatinine, BUN, cystatin C, UACR, 24-hour proteinuria, TGF-β1) and inversely with eGFR. (2)MMP-7 demonstrates comparable diagnostic efficacy to UACR and eGFR, with optimal performance achieved through combined biomarker analysis. (3)MMP-7/SDC1/VEGF/RAAS axis activation in DKD models contributes to renal injury. MMP-7 suppression improves renal function, reduces proteinuria, and attenuates inflam- mation/fibrosis. (4)HGPA-induced MMP-7 upregulation in HK-2 cells promotes SDC1/VEGF/RAAS-mediated renal damage, reversible through MMP-7 silencing. (5)Mechanistic studies confirm MMP-7 orchestrates renal fibrosis and inflammation via SDC1-dependent RAAS activation.

**Background and aims:**
Obesity negatively impacts brain health and increases the risk of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease, while regular exercise provides neuroprotective benefits. We hypoth- esized that obesity and exercise training elicit distinct, cell type-specific transcriptional responses across brain regions, and that exercise can mitigate the detrimental effects of diet-induced obesity.

**Materials and methods:**
Six-week-old male mice were fed either a standard chow diet (10% fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat) for 3 weeks to model impaired glucose tolerance. Mice were divided into four groups: chow-sedentary; HFD-sedentary (n=6/group); chow- trained; and HFD-trained (n=9-10/group). Training consisted of 28 days of voluntary wheel running (6.7 ± 2.3 and 7.5 ± 1.6 km/day in chow and HFD groups, respectively; p=0.38). At the end of the inter- vention, mice were euthanized and cortex, hippocampus, and hypo- thalamus were dissected for single-nuclei transcriptomic profiling.

**Results:**
We profiled 347,334 nuclei and identified 43 subclasses and 91 distinct cell types across the three brain regions. In the exercise training induced robust transcriptional changes in excitatory neurons under both chow and HFD conditions, with enrichment of pathways related to mitochondrial function. In the HFD led to downregulation of synaptic signaling pathways in inhibitory neurons, which was reversed by exercise train- ing, with upregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial metabo- lism and protein catabolism. In the exercise also modulated vascular and immune gene programs, with enrichment in and pathways. Given the importance of neurovascular and immune function in cognition, brain homeo- stasis, and metabolic regulation, we next focused on across brain regions. HFD resulted in downregulation of pathways involved in vascular transport, chemotaxis, and cytokine signaling in the —including and These pathways were partially restored by exercise training in HFD-fed mice, suggesting a functional rescue effect.

**Conclusion:**
These findings demonstrate that exercise training reverses key transcriptional disruptions induced by diet-induced obesity in a brain region- and cell type-specific manner. Effects were particularly evident in neuronal, vascular, and immune compartments, revealing potential molecular pathways through which exercise confers neuro- protection in the context of metabolic disease.

**Background and aims:**
Preliminary findings from pre-clinical and clinical settings support a neuroprotective role for the glucose-lowering glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). We assessed the association between initiating GLP-1 RAs versus other glucose- lowering agents and the risk of developing various neurodegenerative disorders in a global cohort of people living with T2D without prior evidence of neurodegeneration.

**Materials and methods:**
In a retrospective cohort study, we utilized the TriNetX platform, with access to over 170 million people’s records globally. We propensity-score matched (1:1) people with T2D lacking evidence of neurodegeneration who initiated GLP-1 RAs with those initiating dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i) (2010-2021). In a separate analytic cohort, we matched individuals initiating GLP-1 RAs with those initiating basal insulin. Follow-up continued for up to 5 years. We applied Cox proportional-hazards regression models to assess the risk of the composite outcome of developing new neuro- degenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, other synucleinopathies, or any dementia type. We also evalu- ated each component individually. Analyses were conducted in the whole cohort and across separate propensity-score-matched baseline subgroups.

**Results:**
We included 214,112 matched individuals initiating GLP-1 RAs compared to DPP4i (109,731 women, mean age 58.6 years [SD 12], and mean baseline HbA1c 7.7% [1.4]). Among the GLP-1 RAs group, 36.8%, 29.4%, 24.0%, and 9.9% initiated dulaglutide, liraglu- tide, semaglutide, and exenatide, respectively. During a mean follow- up of 4.0 years, the composite outcome occurred in 2393 (2.2%) and 3062 (2.9%) with GLP-1 RAs and DPP4i, respectively (HR 0.81 [95%CI 0.77-0.86]). Similar trends were observed across most tested patient subgroups ( ). The HRs for Alzheimer’s disease, any dementia onset, and Parkinson’s disease were 0.77 [0.68-0.87], 0.76 [0.72-0.81], and 1.04 [0.93-1.17], respectively, with GLP-1 RA versus DPP4i. The results were generally consistent comparing initiation of GLP-1 RAs versus basal insulin (N=196912), except that the respective HR for new-onset Parkinson’s disease was 0.87 [0.77-0.98].

**Conclusion:**
In a global real-world cohort of people living with T2D without evidence of neurodegeneration, the initiation of GLP-1 RAs, compared to DPP4i or basal insulin, was associated with a lower risk of new-onset neurodegeneration.

2. garia, Medical University-Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria.

**Background and aims:**
Previous studies have suggested diminished parasympathetic activity at early stages of dysglycemia. To determine the main risk factors for the presence of severely reduced parasym- pathetic tone in this population, we explored the association between cardio-metabolic status and parasympathetic power estimated by quar- tiles in subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and prediabetes.

**Materials and methods:**
A total of 554 subjects (191 males and 363 females), of mean age 46.9±13.3 years and mean BMI 30.3±7.2 kg/ m divided into two groups according to glucose tolerance - 229 with NGT and 325 with prediabetes, of which 155 with impaired fasting glu- cose (IFG), 80 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 90 with the combination of IFG and IGT, were enrolled. All participants underwent a standard OGTT. Anthropometric indices, blood pressure, HbA1c, serum lipids, hsCRP, creatinine (eGFR was calculated), and ACR (first spot morning urine) were measured. AGEs were evaluated by skin autofluоrescence (AGE-Reader, DiagnOptics, The Netherlands). Body composition was estimated by multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody 720, BioSpace, USA). Parasympathetic function was assessed by quartiles using ANX-3.0 (Physio PS, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA), applying autonomic clinical tests.

**Results:**
26.6% of subjects with prediabetes, as compared to 11.1% of those with NGT (p<0.0001), were in the lowest quartile (Q1) for para- sympathetic activity, and the results were consistent for all prediabetes categories. Regression analysis, adjusted for age, showed that visceral fat mass was independently and inversely related to decreased parasym- pathetic activity (Q1) - OR 0.03, 95% CI: 0.001 - 0.735; p=0.032. On a receiving operating curve analysis, a “cut off” value of 150 ­cm pro- vided a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 60% for very low para- sympathetic tone (Q1) (Figure).

**Conclusion:**
Our results show that visceral fat mass accumulation exerts a prominent role on the severity of parasympathetic decline at the early stages of impaired glucose tolerance.

**Zovaglutide (ZT002), a novel ultra long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist improves memory function and prevents degenerative processes in Alzheimer’s disease animal models**

Y. Zhang

**Background and aims:**
Recent studies indicate that glucagon-like pep- tide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, currently used in the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity, exhibit neuroprotective effects in Alzhei- mer’s disease (AD). Zovaglutide is a novel ultra long-acting glucagon- like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) that is being developed with monthly subcutaneous administration in obesity. We aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects in AD animal models.

**Materials and methods:**
Here we tested the effects of zovaglutide by subcutaneous injected every other day in 5XFAD (Familial Alzhei- mer’s Disease mutations) mice, APPswe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mice, and senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice to demonstrate the pharmacological efficacy of zovaglutide. The cognitive function of mice was assessed using the Morris water maze, novel object recogni- tion, and Y-maze tests. The deposition of Aβ plaques in the hippocam- pus was detected by anti-Aβ immunohistochemistry. The number of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region was examined by HE staining. The levels of activated microglia in the hippocampal region were detected by immunohistochemistry using anti-Iba1.

**Results:**
When tested in 5XFAD AD mice, zovaglutide significantly improved spatial memory, novel object recognition memory, and working memory in Morris water maze, new object recognition and Y-maze, respectively. Zovaglutide significantly reduced Aβ deposi- tion, prevented the CA1 neurons loss and inhibited microglia over- activation in the hippocampus. When tested in APP/PS1 AD mice, zovaglutide significantly improved spatial memory and working memory. Zovaglutide dose-dependently reduced Aβ deposition and prevented hippocampal CA1 neurons loss. When tested in SAMP8 AD mice, zovaglutide significantly improves spatial memory and working memory.

**Conclusion:**
This novel ultra long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist delayed the progressive decline in memory function and prevented key neurodegenerative developments in AD animal models, thus suggest- ing that zovaglutide as a once-monthly GLP-1RA represents a novel treatment strategy for Alzheimer’s disease.

**ZT006, a novel oral GLP-1 receptor agonist improves memory function, reduces brain insulin resistance and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease animal models**

Y. Zhang

**Background and aims:**
ZT006 is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) that is being developed with oral admin- istration, are currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials for indication of obesity. Recent studies indicate that GLP-1RA exhibits neuropro- tective effects in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of ZT006 in AD animal models with oral administration.

**Materials and methods:**
Here we tested the efficacy of ZT006 by oral administration once daily in two AD animal models including 5XFAD (Familial Alzheimer’s Disease mutations) mice and senescence-accel- erated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice model. The cognitive function of mice was assessed using the Morris water maze, novel object recogni- tion, and Y-maze tests. The deposition of Aβ plaques in the hippocam- pus was detected by anti-Aβ immunohistochemistry. The number of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region was examined by HE staining. The insulin resistance in the hippocampus was detected by anti-p(Ser616)-IRS1 immunostaining. The levels of activated micro- glia and reactive astrogliosis in the hippocampal region were detected by immunohistochemistry using anti-Iba-1 and anti-GFAP antibodies, respectively. Additionally, the levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα in the hippocampal tissue were measured by ELISA.

**Results:**
When tested in 5XFAD mice model, ZT006 significantly improved spatial memory, novel object recognition memory, and working memory. ZT006 significantly reduced Aβ deposition, pre- vented neuronal loss, improves insulin resistance and mitigated neu- roinflammation, including microglial activation, astrocytic gliosis, and decreased levels of inflammatory factors in the hippocampus. When tested in SAMP8 AD mice, ZT006 significantly improves spatial mem- ory, novel object recognition and working memory. ZT006 significantly prevented the neurons loss and reduced neuroinflammation in the hip- pocampus of SAMP8 mice model.

**Conclusion:**
In AD animal models, ZT006 delayed the cognitive decline and prevented key neurodegenerative changes, possibly medi- ated by reducing brain insulin resistance and neuroinflammation. These data suggested that ZT006 tablet represents a novel treatment strategy for AD.

**Uncovering the hepatic signature in the comorbidity of diabesity and Alzheimer’s disease: a novel peripheral target for neurodegeneration**

**Background and aims:**
Metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are increasingly recognized as risk factors for Alzheimer’s dis- ease (AD), yet the underlying systemic mechanisms remain incompletely understood. While the brain has been the main focus of AD pathology, recent evidence suggests that peripheral organs, particularly the liver, may actively influence neurodegenerative progression through inflam- matory and metabolic cross-talk. In this late-breaking study, we provide novel evidence that the liver undergoes profound molecular alterations in the context of diabetes-related-to-obesity, referred as to diabesity, and associated prodromal AD.

**Materials and methods:**
To this purpose, we employed a two-hit model in male C57BL/6J mice, fed a high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) diet for either 12 or 18 weeks to induce progressive metabolic derangement char- acteristic of diabesity. One week before sacrifice (at week 11 or 17), a subset of animals received a single intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ to mimic early-stage AD. This design enabled the investigation of hepatic alterations in both early (pre-diabetic) and overt diabesity stages. In addition to inflammatory and lipid-related outcomes, we assessed markers of hepatic glucose metabolism and Aβ clearance.

**Results:**
Aβ injection altered hepatic gluconeogenic regulation in both STD- and HFHS-fed mice, indicating that central amyloid pathology can independently impact liver glucose metabolism, in the presence or not of overt metabolic dysfunction. Hepatic inflammatory profiling revealed a strong response to Aβ, amplified in HFHS-fed mice. NLRP3 inflamma- some activation and upregulation of IL-1β, IL-18, COX-2, TLR4, and MCP-1 were observed, consistent with a primed innate immune state under metabolic stress. Concomitantly, Aβ aggravated hepatic lipid imbal- ance. HFHS+Aβ mice showed increased expression of CD36, fatty acid synthase, and PPARγ, and decreased PPARα, revealing a dual insult on lipid uptake, synthesis, and oxidation. Strikingly, Aβ administration revealed a selective disruption in hepatic Aβ clearance. LRP1 expres- sion was reduced only in STD+Aβ mice, implying that in HFHS-fed animals this receptor was already compromised due to its dual role in amyloid and lipoprotein transport. Similarly, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and ADAM10, an α-secretase involved in non-amyloidogenic APP processing, were upregulated only in STD+Aβ mice, but not in the HFHS group, pointing to a loss of compensatory clearance mechanisms under metabolic stress.

**Conclusion:**
Together, our findings uncover a novel, time-dependent hepatic signature of neurodegeneration in diabesity, involving disrupted glucose and lipid metabolism, heightened inflammation, and impaired amyloid clearance. This identifies the liver as a critical peripheral modula- tor actively contributing to AD pathogenesis in the context of metabolic disease. Our data provide compelling new translational evidence that tar- geting hepatic pathways involved in metabolic dysfunction and amyloid detoxification may represent an innovative strategy to mitigate neuro- degenerative progression in populations burdened by diabesity. These insights open promising avenues for the development of peripheral inter- ventions aimed at the comorbidity between metabolic disorders and AD.

1. Kolling Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia, Depart-
3. Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia, Renal Department, Royal North

**Background and aims:**
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are incretin hormones secreted postprandially, enhancing insulin secretion and improving insulin sensitivity. Tirzepatide (TZP) is a GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Early clinical data suggests that TZP may improve glycaemic control and reduce insulin requirements in type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, its impact on T1D disease progression remains poorly defined. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of TZP on glucose regulation, β-cell function, and diabetes onset in the non-obese dia- betic (NOD) mouse model of T1D.

**Materials and methods:**
8-week-old female NOD mice received either TZP (administered subcutaneously thrice per week; dose incremented to 40 nmol/kg) or saline control (CON) with access to water and high-gluten pellet feed (NOD2 diet, Specialty Feeds) for a maxi- mum of 28 weeks. At 6 weeks of treatment, a subset of mice (n=10/ group) underwent oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and glucose- stimulated insulin secretion testing (GSIS) following a 6-hour fast. Data was analysed using Student’s t-test on the area under the curve (AUC). Fasting blood glucose was measured weekly via tail vein sampling with diabetes being defined as two consecutive readings >270 mg/dL (15 mmol/L). Mice that met this threshold were euthanised, and survival analysis was performed using the Mantel-Cox (log-rank) test.

**Results:**
At week 6 of treatment, TZP-treated mice demonstrated sig- nificantly improved glucose tolerance compared to controls (AUC_glu- cose: CON 958.4±52.6mmol/L/min vs. TZP 661.1±61.6mmol/L/min, p<0.01), and plasma insulin levels were significantly reduced in the TZP group at baseline and in response to glucose (AUC_insulin: CON 190.4±48.9ng/mL/min vs. TZP 39.4±13.2ng/mL/min, p<0.01). Over the 28-week study period, TZP-treated mice exhibited a significantly higher and earlier incidence of diabetes compared to controls (log-rank test: ² = 10.87, p<0.001), indicating accelerated disease progression.

**Conclusion:**
Despite enhancing glucose clearance, TZP suppressed insulin secretion and was associated with earlier onset of diabetes in the NOD mice. These findings highlight the complexity of incretin- based therapies in T1D and show the necessity for mechanistic studies to delineate their impact on β-cell integrity.

**F.prausnitzii-derived butyrate induces remission of type 1 diabetes through CPT1A-mediated TIGIT+ Treg metabolic reprogramming**

T. Zhong

**Background and aims:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that prompted by autoreactive T cells, leading to the destruc- tion of pancreatic β cells. Individuals with T1D require a lifelong reliance on exogenous insulin, which places a significant strain on both patients and healthcare resources. The pathogenesis of T1D involves a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, eventually resulting in the breakdown of immunological tolerance. As a result, immunomodulation-based treatments have emerged as promising strategies. We previously identified a T1D-specific TIGIT+ Treg cell subset using single-cell transcriptomics and elu- cidated its intrinsic mechanisms for inducing remission. However, the upstream regulatory mechanisms of this subset remain unknown. In recent years, the gut microbiota has been shown to be intimately linked to the immune response in T1D. Therefore, we aim to investi- gate new mechanisms by which TIGIT+ Treg cells induce remission of T1D from the perspective of gut microbiota.

**Materials and methods:**
Using cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of T1D (remitters and non-remitters), we combined fecal metagenomics and machine learning algorithms to identify gut microbiota most closely associated with T1D islet function and TIGIT+ Treg cells. Targeted metabolomics was employed to char- acterize the changes in gut microbiota metabolites in the serum of T1D patients. Additionally, we utilized cell metabolomics, flow cytometry, RNA-seq, in vitro intervention experiments, and in vivo NOD mouse models to elucidate the signaling pathways mediated by gut microbiota in T1D.

**Results:**
1) Fecal metagenomics identifies F.prausnitzii enrichment in T1D remission. 2) Machine learning and association analyses reveal a positive correlation between F. prausnitzii abundance and TIGIT+ Treg levels. 3) Targeted short-chain fatty acid metabo- lomics revealed that serum levels of butyrate (a major metabolite of F. prausnitzii) were significantly elevated in T1D patients dur- ing remission. 4) RNA sequencing analysis showed that butyrate notably enhanced the fatty acid metabolic activity of Treg cells and increased CPT1A expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that sodium butyrate promotes TIGIT expression and activity in Treg cells in a CPT1A-dependent manner. 4) Notably, oral admin- istration of sodium butyrate significantly increased the proportion of TIGIT+ Treg cells, ameliorates insulitis and delays T1D progres- sion in NOD mice.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, butyrate produced by F. prausnitzii regu- lates CPT1A-dependent fatty acid oxidation, induces TIGIT+ Tregs differentiation through intra-cellular metabolism, and mediates the pathogenesis of the remission period of T1D. These findings not only advance our understanding of the microbiota’s influence on T1D but also highlight potential therapeutic strategies involving short-chain fatty acids for disease management.

3. mark, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

**Background and aims:**
Amylin, a 37-amino acid peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic beta cells, has been proposed to improve glycaemic control by suppressing glucagon secretion and slowing gastric emptying, thereby reducing postprandial glucose excur- sions. Here, we investigated the effect of continuous i.v. infusion of the amylin analogue pramlintide on circulating levels of glucagon, insulin and glucose in individuals with type 1 diabetes and matched healthy controls under fasting conditions.

**Materials and methods:**
This randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled crossover study included 10 C-peptide negative individuals with type 1 diabetes (age (mean ± SD): 28.9 ± 5.1 years; BMI: 24.2 ± 2.5 kg/m²; HbA1c: 45.7 ± 8.0 mmol/mol) and 10 healthy age, gender, and BMI-matched controls (age: 28.5 ± 7.1 years; BMI: 24.3 ± 2.1 kg/m²; HbA1c: 29.6 ± 3.4 mmol/mol). Each participant completed two fasting study days receiving a 3-hour i.v. infusion of either pram- lintide (3.0 pmol/kg/min) or saline (placebo). Individuals with type 1 diabetes continued their usual basal insulin regimen; no bolus insulin was administered on study days. Glucagon, insulin and glucose were measured at regular intervals. Baseline-subtracted AUCs (bsAUCs) were compared using two-level mixed-effects ANOVA.

**Results:**
Pramlintide did not significantly affect glucagon levels com- pared to placebo in healthy controls (bsAUC (mean ± SEM): -458 ± 134 vs -251 ± 131 pmol/L×min, = 0.18) or in individuals with type 1 diabetes (bsAUC: -390 ± 69 vs -309 ± 132 pmol/L×min, = 0.59), and its effect on glucagon was not significantly different between the groups ( = 0.55). Similarly, pramlintide had no significant effect on insu- lin levels in healthy controls (bsAUC: -1,733 ± 446 vs -1,692 ± 362 pmol/L×min, = 0.98) or in individuals with type 1 diabetes (bsAUC: -2,979 ± 1,131 vs -1,209 ± 2,323 pmol/L×min, = 0.22). In healthy controls, glucose levels did not significantly differ between pramlintide and placebo study days (bsAUC: 14 ± 10 vs -5 ± 11 mmol/L×min, = 0.51). In contrast, individuals with type 1 diabetes exhibited a signifi- cant decrease in glucose levels in response to pramlintide compared to placebo (bsAUC: -206 ± 31 vs -130 ± 51 mmol/L×min, = 0.02); a significantly greater decrease as compared to controls ( = 0.03).

**Conclusion:**
A 3-hour i.v. infusion of the amylin analogue pramlintide did not affect glucagon levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes or healthy controls compared to placebo. However, pramlintide appeared to reduce glucose levels in individuals with type 1, which may suggest a differential glucose-lowering effect between groups.

**Beyond the average: heterogeneity in glycaemic patterns across the menstrual cycle**

M. Rothenbühler, M. ­Friedman, S. Khan-Gallo, S. ­Hossmann

1. Diabetes Center Berne, Bern, Switzerland, Tidepool, Palo Alto, CA,

**Background and aims:**
Premenopausal women with type 1 diabe- tes experience fluctuations in glucose levels related to their menstrual cycles. Previous research and anecdotal reports from the diabetes com- munity both indicate that insulin needs change across cycle phases, and as a result, many women resort to adjusting their automated insulin delivery (AID) systems to ensure appropriate insulin delivery. Recog- nizing the diversity in glucose patterns across menstrual cycle phases is key to informing more personalized and effective diabetes management strategies. A central aim of the study was to characterize individual glu- cose variability across the cycle using a combination of self-reported menstrual cycle data and real-world continuous glucose monitoring measurements.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted an analysis of anonymized data donated by 77 women using an AID system. Participants were recruited through Tidepool’s community outreach channels and pro- vided informed consent to share data for up to 12 menstrual cycles via an electronic survey. For the analysis, menstrual cycles were divided into three distinct phases: follicular, peri-ovulatory, and luteal phases. Cycles with length between 21 and 38 days were included in the analy- sis. To assess inter-cycle glucose variation, we categorized the rela- tive changes in glucose levels across cycle phases into three groups: a decrease of ≥5%, an increase of ≥5%, or stable (<5% change).

**Results:**
Mean participant age was 35.1 (±8.2) years, with 19 women (25%) reporting the use of hormonal therapies, including 16 on hor- monal contraception. Mean TIR was 79.1% (±14.6%) and the average menstrual cycle length was 28.1 (±3) days. Analysis of 386 menstrual cycles revealed substantial variability in glucose patterns across the fol- licular, peri-ovulatory, and luteal phases. Notably, 96% of women and 69% of cycles exhibited at least one phase-to-phase glycaemic change exceeding 5%. Furthermore, 65% of the participants experienced a ≥10% change in glycaemia between two consecutive cycle phases. In contrast, less than a third of all cycles (30.6%) remained stable with <5% glycaemic variation across phases. Cycles exhibiting directional shifts, such as an increase in glycaemia followed by a decrease (14.8%) or vice versa (12.4%), were also frequently observed. Additionally, 42% of participants reported routinely performing manual adjustments such as applying temporary overrides or activating exercise modes to man- age cycle-related changes in insulin requirements.

**Conclusion:**
This high degree of inter- and intra-cycle variability, together with the extensive use of manual interventions, suggests that current AID systems may not adequately compensate for hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. These findings underscore the need for future AID systems to incorporate individualized, cycle-aware adaptations that alleviate the burden of manual diabetes management for women and enhance glycaemic control.

**Sustained glycaemic improvements with extended use of the Omni-**

**Background and aims:**
The efficacy and safety of the ­Omnipod 5 AID System compared with multiple daily injections (MDI) and con- tinuous glucose monitor (CGM) therapy in adults and children with T1D and suboptimal glycemia was recently demonstrated in the RADI- ANT study, a multinational randomized controlled trial (RCT). This analysis evaluated glycemic outcomes during the extension phase of the RADIANT study.

**Materials and methods:**
In the 13-week RCT, adults and children aged 4-70y with T1D and screening HbA1c 7.5-11% (58-97 mmol/mol) cur- rently using MDI with a FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM for ≥3 months were enrolled across 19 institutions in France, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. Participants completed 14 days of baseline data collection with MDI+CGM, then were randomly assigned 2:1 to AID (interven- tion) or to continue with MDI+CGM (control). During the extension phase (weeks 14-26), participants in the control group initiated AID (MDI-AID group) and participants in the intervention group continued to use the AID system (AID-AID group).

**Results:**
A total of 187 participants (MDI-AID: n=63, AID-AID: n=124) continued into the extension phase, of which 96% (180/187) completed it. Improvements in HbA1c were observed at 26 weeks in the MDI-AID group (week 13 vs 26: 8.0% vs 7.3% [64 vs 56 mmol/ mol], <0.0001), while the initial improvements from baseline were maintained in the AID-AID group (baseline vs week 26: 8.1% vs 7.2% [65 vs 55 mmol/mol], <0.0001) (Figure). Similarly, time in range (70- 180 mg/dL [3.9-10.0 mmol/L]) during the extension phase increased in the MDI-AID group (week 13 vs 26: 43% vs 65%, <0.0001) and was maintained in the AID-AID group (baseline vs week 26: 39% vs 66%, <0.0001). In both groups, time <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) remained low at 26 weeks: median 2.3% vs 2.2% at week 13 in the MDI-AID group and 2.5% vs 2.2% at baseline in the AID-AID group (both >0.05).

**Conclusion:**
These extension phase results demonstrated significant improvements in glycemic outcomes with AID use, providing further evidence to support the feasibility of direct transition from MDI to AID in adults and children with T1D not meeting glycemic targets.

**Negative impact of HLA haplotype DR4DQ8 is stronger than**

**Background and aims:**
Genotypes DR4DQ8 and DR3DQ2 are docu- mented as major risk factors for type 1 diabetes. Corresponding effects on LADA (=Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in the Adult) have been reported, but only in qualitative terms. Here we investigated the fre- quency and the relative impact of DR4DQ8 and DR3DQ2 using data from two population-based studies.

**Materials and methods:**
We analyzed LADA data from the Norwe- gian longitudinal Health Study in Trøndelag (HUNT, HUNT 2(1995- 97), HUNT3(2006-2008), and HUNT4 (2017-2019)) and the Swedish cross-sectional study ESTRID (Epidemiological Study of Risk factors for LADA and type 2 diabetes). Diagnosis of LADA required positiv- ity of Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA). For this study levels of GADA were dichotomized (between high and low). HLA haplotypes were categorized as DR3DQ2 (DR3DQ2 positive but DR4DQ8 negative), DR4DQ8 (DR4DQ8 positive but DR3DQ2 negative), combined DR3DQ2 +DR4DQ8, and Other (negative for DR3DQ2 and DR4DQ8).

**Results:**
In the HUNT study population 231 individuals were diag- nosed as LADA. Of these, 44 % displayed no risk haplotype, i.e. Other, 20% were DR4DQ8 and 18% DR3DQ2 (single haplotypes). In ESTRID 536 individuals were diagnosed as LADA, 27% displayed Other, 25 % were DR4DQ8 and 18% DR3DQ2. In HUNT a comparison between double haplotypes vs. either one of DR3DQ2 or DR4DQ8 indicated a stronger enhancing effect of doubles vs DR3DQ2 singly than DR4DQ8 singly. For doubles versus DR3DQ2 differences were seen for fast- ing C-peptide, p<0,006, fasting glucose, p<0.029, insulin treatment, p<0.005 and high GADA p<0,013. For doubles versus DR4DQ8 there were no significant differences except for high GADA, p<0.046. Reciprocally, in ESTRID directly comparing DR4DQ8 haplotype with DR3DQ2 showed higher levels of fasting glucose, median 15,2 vs 11.8 mM, p<0.023 and a tendency for higher HBA1c, 78.0 vs. 60,5 mmol/ mol, in DR4DQ8, p< 0.053.

**Conclusion:**
DR4DQ8 and DR3DQ2 are present at equal frequencies in Scandinavian LADA populations. Both haplotypes associate with high levels of GADA, however evidence indicates a stronger negative impact on LADA diabetes by DR4DQ8 than by DR3DQ2. Measure- ments of each of these haplotypes could give valuable information when assessing the state and prognosis of LADA diabetes.

**Background and aims:**
Clustering analysis identified severe autoim- mune diabetes (SAID), severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), and mild age-related diabetes (MARD) with different outcomes. In Asia, diabetes is characterised by young age of diagnosis, low BMI, and low beta-cell function who might benefit from therapies that pro- mote insulin secretion.

**Materials and methods:**
In a consecutive subcohort of Chinese patients diagnosed with T2D enrolled in the Hong Kong Diabetes Register (1995-2019; HKDR) in whom C-peptide and GAD auto- antibodies (GADA) were measured, we performed k-means cluster- ing based on Ahlqvist’s variables (GADA, age of diagnosis, BMI, ­HbA , HOMA2-IR, and HOMA2-B) to identify diabetes subtypes. We compared outcomes including early insulin requirement or its need ­(A >8.5% on two non-insulin glucose-lowering drugs) and analysed the distribution of T2D pathway-specific genetic risk scores (pwGRS) across clusters. We derived a clinical risk score (CRS) using common variables (age of diagnosis, disease duration, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and systolic blood pressure) to predict SIDD. We evaluated its performance in predicting adverse outcomes amongst the remain- ing patients in the HKDR (1995-2019, n=17,417) without C-peptide or GADA.

**Results:**
Amongst 2,790 insulin-naïve patients with T2D enrolled in 1995-2012 (mean age: 51.5±12.8 years; median disease duration: 3 [IQR: 1-8] years; mean age of diagnosis: 46.1±12.2 years; 48.4% men; median C-peptide: 459.0 [IQR: 167.1-704.3] pmol/L; mean HOMA2- IR: 1.3±1.1; mean HOMA2-B: 47.5±37.2%), we identified five distinct clusters: SAID (4.4%), SIDD (15.1%), SIRD (17.2), MARD (33.3%), and a novel SIDD-like subgroup (young-onset diabetes [YOD]-SIDD; 30.0%) with younger age of diagnosis than SIDD (36.5 vs. 42.3 years). The SAID, SIDD, and YOD-SIDD groups had the lowest HOMA2-B: 38.6%, 23.9%, and 27.0% respectively. During a median follow-up of 15.4 years (43,151 person-years), median time to insulin requirement or its need were: SAID (8.8 years), SIDD (7.2 years), YOD-SIDD (12.6 years), SIRD (10.7 years), and MARD (10.9 years). The YOD-SIDD subgroup was most represented in the top quintile of T2D pwGRS for beta-cell dysfunction (23.3%) and impaired fasting glucose (24.5%). The SIDD group had the highest adjusted incidence of CVD, CKD and all-cause mortality. The ROC of SIDD-CRS for predicting SIDD was 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) with the optimal cut-off point having an accuracy of 94%. In the validation cohort (mean age: 55.5±12.1 years; median disease duration: 4 [IQR: 1-10] years; mean age of diagnosis: 49.4±12.3 years; 51.8% men) followed up for 8.7 years, the high SIDD- CRS group (n=4,888; 28%) had higher incidence of all events (5.5% vs 3.7%) than the non-SIDD group (n=12,529) with an HR of 1.47 (95% CI 1.39-1.55).

**Conclusion:**
Half of Chinese patients with T2D had severe insulin deficiency associated with adverse outcomes. A simple CRS identified these high-risk individuals who may benefit from early therapies that promote insulin secretion calling for more RCTs in precision therapy.

**Background and aims:**
It is recognised that Type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be reversed via surgery, lifestyle and pharmacotherapies.

**Materials and methods:**
This systematic review identified both ran- domised control trials (RCTs) and cohort studies using a pre-deter- mined search strategy applied to three different electronic databases. After removing the duplicates and screening, the data were synthesised using network meta-analysis open access software MetaInsight. T2D remission was defined as HbA1c < 6.5% at least ≥ 3 months without any medication and categorised by duration of follow-up. RCTs and Cohort Studies were analysed separately with Bayesian modelling for ranking. Due to limitations with MetaInsight, random effect modelling and forest plots generated in STATA to determine effect size of studies with single or multiple arms.

**Results:**
Twenty RCTs and 20 cohort studies were identified. RCTs: Interventions were pooled into a total of nine groups to permit data synthesis and produce three network analyses (NWA) by follow-up FU (≤ 1 year, 1-2 years and >2 years). NWA-1: Nine treatments were evaluated across 14 studies with FU ≤ 1 year. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery had a (Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve SUCRA) value of 95.7% for achieving remission vs. Intensive insu- lin therapy plus incretin analogues with the lowest SUCRA value, at 27.1%. NWA-2: Ten studies with 8 interventions and FU 1-2 years. Sleeve gastrectomy had a SUCRA value of 88.4% vs. Intensive insulin therapy alone or combined with oral drugs with a SUCRA of 25.5%. NWA-3: Eight studies with 6 treatments and FU >2 years (range: 0.5- 12 years). Sleeve gastrectomy ranked highest with a SUCRA value of 81.5% vs. Total calorie restriction with/without exercise with the low- est SUCRA (20.5%). Cohort Studies: Interventions were pooled into 7 groups to permit data synthesis and produce two NWAs by FU (≤2 and >2years). NWA-4: Eleven studies (6 interventions, ≤2 FU). Life- style management ranked highest with SUCRA 97.3% vs. Adjustable gastric banding (AGB). NWA-5: Four studies (5 interventions, >2years FU). Lifestyle management ranked highest with SUCRA 97.3% vs. AGB. Across both NWA and contrastingly, AGB ranked lowest with SUCRAs of 24.7% and 40.5%, respectively. Random-effects modelling revealed a significant effect in both short- and long-term follow-up groups, albeit with substantial heterogeneity was observed: for studies ≤2 years (n=17), the pooled effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.39-0.77; I² = 99.7%), and for studies >2 years (n=6), 0.41 (95% CI: 0.13-0.71; I² = 99.8%), both reaching statistical significance (p < 0.001).

**Conclusion:**
Bariatric surgery revealed the highest effectiveness for diabetes remission across all follow-up periods. However, a high rate of relapse was observed overtime, irrespective of the intervention type- potentially due to the absence of structured remission-maintenance strategies within the interventions. studied.

**Background and aims:**
Diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are major public health concerns and remain leading causes of morbidity and mortality following kidney transplantation. Both preexisting diabetes (Pre-DM) and post-transplant diabetes mel- litus (PTDM) have been associated with adverse post-transplant out- comes. However, comparative data on their respective contributions to cardiovascular events remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Pre-DM and PTDM on the incidence of cardiovascular events in kidney transplant recipients.

**Materials and methods:**
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,930 patients who underwent kidney transplantation at a tertiary care center between 1979 and 2020. Patients were stratified into three groups—pre-transplant diabetes mellitus (Pre-DM), post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM), and non-diabetic (Non-DM)—based on the presence and timing of diabetes diagnosis relative to the transplanta- tion date. To assess the association between diabetes status and car- diovascular outcomes, we applied a Cox proportional hazards model. The primary endpoint was the incidence of four-point major adverse cardiovascular events (4P-MACE), comprising myocardial infarction, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, and cardiovascular death.

**Results:**
During a median follow-up period of 6.5 years, 4P-MACE occurred in 36 patients (3.1%) in the Non-DM group, 65 patients (14.3%) in the Pre-DM group, and 33 patients (10.7%) in the PTDM group. After adjusting for potential confounders—including age, sex, body mass index, waiting time, ABO incompatibility, number of HLA mismatches, history of cardiovascular disease, donor age, and donor type (living vs. deceased)—Pre-DM was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 3.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.29-5.74, p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with Pre-DM had the highest cumulative incidence of 4P-MACE, followed by those with PTDM, indicating an intermediate risk. Furthermore, all-cause mortality was significantly elevated in the Pre-DM group, whereas no significant difference in mor- tality was observed in the PTDM group compared to Non-DM patients.

**Conclusion:**
Both pre-transplant diabetes mellitus (Pre-DM) and post- transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) were significantly associated with increased cardiovascular risk in kidney transplant recipients. Notably, the risk of cardiovascular events was higher in patients with Pre-DM compared to those with PTDM, highlighting the critical need for more intensive management of cardiovascular risk factors in transplant recipients with pre-existing diabetes to improve long-term outcomes.

**Background and aims:**
Insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) is a once-weekly basal insulin in development for the treatment of diabetes. Efsitora demonstrated noninferior improvements in glycated haemoglobin and similar rates of combined clinically significant (level 2 [<3.0 mmol/L; 54 mg/dL]) or severe (level 3) hypoglycaemia compared to insulin degludec in QWINT-2, a Phase 3 study conducted in insulin naïve adults with T2D. This post hoc analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of efsitora throughout the week, relative to the day of administration.

**Materials and methods:**
Periodic blinded continuous glucose moni- toring (CGM) sessions were conducted in the QWINT-2 trial. Percent time in range (TIR: 3.9 -10.0 mmol/L [70-180 mg/dL]), time below range (TBR: <3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL] or 3.0-3.9 mmol/L [54-70 mg/ dL]), and time above range (TAR: 10.0 -13.9 mmol/L [180-250 mg/ dL] or >13.9 mmol/L [250 mg/dL]) from the blinded CGM sessions were calculated on the day of efsitora dosing (Day 0) and for 6 days post-administration. CGM parameters from the CGM session in the 4 weeks prior to the primary endpoint (weeks 48-52) are reported here. Patient-reported rates of combined level 2 or 3 hypoglycaemia were also calculated relative to the day of efsitora administration for the 52-week treatment period.

**Results:**
Efsitora treatment demonstrated consistent TIR by-day over the course of the week (figure). TIR over the course of the week was also similar between efsitora and degludec. Efsitora TBR (3.0-3.9 mmol/L [54-70 mg/dL]) was consistently low across the week. Efsi- tora TBR (<3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]) remained below the international consensus recommendation of <1%. Patient-reported rates of combined level 2 or 3 hypoglycaemia were low and consistent across the week for efsitora and degludec. Efsitora showed rates of 0.47, 0.65, and 0.50, and degludec showed rates of 0.47, 0.30, and 0.37 events per partici- pant per year for Days 0, 3, and 6, respectively.

**Conclusion:**
Use of once weekly efsitora provides steady glycaemic control throughout the week with a consistently low risk of hypogly- caemia, as assessed by blinded CGM in insulin naïve adults with T2D.
